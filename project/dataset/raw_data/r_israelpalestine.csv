">what lead you to become pro Israel? Do you read any piece of media or history book that lead you to that conclusion?

My country has pretty close ties with Israel. There are many jews here, many of whom moved to Israel. There are a lot of workplaces provided by Israel's IT companies. My country is also a Christian country, so it puts some special significance to Israel. So the people here generally have good feelings towards Israel, after oct7 I've yet to see one single pro palestinian person IRL.

>who would you want running the current Israeli government if you dislike Bibi.

Dunno, I'm not an expert on Israeli politics. But I do dislike Netanyahu.

>what concessions are you willing to make for peace?

I dunno what concession would be effective in stopping the war.

>do you have pro Palestine friends? If so, how is talking about the conflict like with them?

I don't, but if I had one I'd just not bring up the subject.

>what criticisms do you have of your own side?

Well, I wouldn't say that it's my own side, I'm not in the same trenches with Israelis or something. But the main criticism is Israel's intelligence and military letting oct7 happen. Wtf is this.

>anyone from the pro Palestine side that you like to listen to that you expect even if you don’t agree with them

Nope.

I don't look at them.

"There are so many bad faith assumptions in the lancet comment. 

The biggest one is also quite important in terms of The Hague cases. It’s been alleged Israel is purposefully starving Gaza. The lancent article takes it at face value and assumes a large but unspecified number have died or will die due to lack of food. 

But there are literally zero evidence for any type of famine or starvation. 
The organization that calculates the IPC scale found no evidence of famine. In fact, they conducted a survey on deaths in Gaza, finding that direct conflict deaths occur but got no responses from Gazans saying they know anyone who died of starvation. 

And this is coming from an entity that wished there was a famine. IPC folks still believe they’ll find a famine someday. 

Therefore, if these people couldn’t find a single famine death from a representative sample of gazans that they surveyed, there’s absolutely zero justification for the lancent people to claim anticipated deaths standing at tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of gazans due to starvation. It’s purely a blood libel. 

There’s absolutely no evidence for this claim. 

If the UN or The Hague had any modicum of credibility they’d give little to no weight to claims made by such entities as UNWRA or the Hamas “ministry of health” or Al Jazeera. If the United States was smart (and a good ally) it would’ve stopped pretending like the UN has any legitimacy. The head of the UN mission in Gaza just posted these lies on twitter. 

This just gives me back flashbacks to the Covid hysteria. Maybe not a popular opinion, but it’s an opinion that should be. We used to claim America has a much higher mortality rate than countries like Russia or Kenya. Well, of course we did! We have a competent (generally speaking) government while Russia lies about their mortality rates, or just doesn’t bother to check. And then “experts” come around and use these dumb statistics to impose all sorts of nonsense measures that did more harm than good, even AFTER the vaccines and the mutations. 

To still believe in “experts” from self proclaimed neutral or objective entities after the Covid fiascos is beyond me.",r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZMGdaWGNjX012WV81Tjc2NjJBZWt0MkVkSHF3U1k0cXlyMHlIN3ZMVVRLTVhiUjVIaVR1ZkZvbHNURXdfMGNETUZ0QUpzLS03eFBSbzlkZWJ1c2I5empaVTdGTGtVTWpDay1wRW1tcUFrYm89

">Common misconception, but actually the Jewish population only owned about 7% of the land before the UN recommended they be granted a state encompassing 56% of it.


And Arabs only owned 9% of the land in mandatory Palestine. Most of the lands are owned by the state.


>You might have misunderstood because you didn't read it. The question wasn't whether people have a right to move somewhere - of course they do, just as anyone who wants to has a right to move to Israel today and nobody in Israel would try to stop them. The question was whether shared ethnicity with people who live somewhere gives you the right to move somewhere and take land from other people who live there. Or, I suppose, set up your own country in this new territory and declare yourself and your fellow immigrants to be the government and to have political control over anyone else living there.


Because your statement was confusing. The right to move is irrelevant. Jews have the rights to set up their own country in mandatory Palestine and they don't have to prove anything. Israel has been recognized as a sovereign state under international law.


>Was it explained at the time that any land Israel decide to seize using military force would then become Israel? Because if not, I don't see what gives Israel the right to use military force to seize additional territory as they are currently doing.


You mean Israel wants to seize Gaza and absorb millions of hostile population who would be funded by its taxpayers? 


>They had a tiny fraction of the population in those places. The settlements have expanded by more than 35 times the total population of the Gaza settlements in the past two decades alone. It isn't remotely comparable and until Israel demonstrates that it is capable of forcing hundreds of thousands of people out of the West Bank and into Israeli territory by actually doing that, I see no reason to pretend to believe that they ever intend to do this.


More claim. You don't have to believe it. They are capable of doing that and have done that.




>No they didn't. They didn't annex this territory at the time when they could have extremely questionably justified it through a defensive war, because they didn't want to give the people living there the right to vote. As such it is not Israeli territory and they have no right to seize it today.


So what makes you think Israelis want to annex all area C of West Bank with hundreds of thousands Palestinians living there who don't want to be a part of Israel?


>Yes, you do think this. You think it's ridiculous that people think land their parents and grandparents used to live on could possibly be theirs through some sort of farcical ""inheritance"" or whatever people might call that. But you're fine with people claiming land through an ancestral connection from thousands of years ago.


For me, I still think it is laughable. They want their grandfathers' land back, then what? All of them live in Israel, a country that they hate?


>Ah yes, the security justification of needing to house large numbers of civilians in dangerous territory in case a war breaks out. Just putting them there are some sort of metaphorical shield, but instead of being formed of something like metal, this shield is made up of humans. This is very believable. It's right up there with the competing claim that Israel isn't expanding the settlements at all, they have nothing to do with it and the settlers aren't part of any deliberate plan.


Can you find out in the internet the percentage of Israeli settlement in the Area C, and what is the majority of the land used for?

"**Doesn't that trouble you?**

Not really. That's for three reasons. The first and foremost is that most Palestinians don't believe that Hamas committed any crimes. There are a number of reasons for that. They range from distrust of Israeli news, being unaware of what went on in that day or the perception that Hamas was fighting Israel for Palestinian rights when no one else has or will. 

The second reason is that it's normal for people to support organisations that are nominally fighting for independence and liberation, especially when no one else will.  

The increase of support is normal for a population that wants it's liberation. The Irish, the Algerians, the Libyans all were largely supportive of the faction that nominally fought for their independence, no matter the crimes that the faction committed. 

The third reason is that the Palestinians in Gaza are in an active warzone right now suffering greatly at the hands of the Israeli counter attack and Hamas is generally regarded as the leader of the defence of Gaza from the Israeli counter attack. 

I think it's natural for people in Gaza to want to support Hamas in the circumstances. I expect that when the war dies down, Hamas's popularity will go downhill so long as the aftermath is handled correctly.  

If Israel occupy Gaza militarily the same way they occupy the West Bank, Hamas's popularity will soar even more.",r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZSFlDMkNyMUlGaGd3ODJJaHJiSGNWYVNTMnBpTTN3SFpjbktyMWlRbjMwOFJndkZoZ1RjSGlrVmxiY1NITktPcnNBSVowS3hEWWFSMWlSTWRIeGFHQWc9PQ==

"You do realize that the British empire proposed the white paper of 1939. They wanted to create a multi-ethnic state with equal rights for arab locals and Jewish immigrants. 

Palestinans said YES and zionists said NO and started a civil war. 

For instance , terror group lehi did bombing of King David in july 1946 , they killed many civilians. 

The story is quite simple and basic... Zionism came to an already populated land with one goal: to establish a Jewish majority state with any means possible. This caused the tragic ethnic cleansing of 800k palestinan from their homes and a never ending cycle of violence. 

While I understand that we cannot reverse history , the only way forward is either two solution or one state with equal rights for all. Israel also must pay compensations for the palestinan refugees who lost their homes. 

Sadly , This seems far away from happening because israel is led by fascist alt-right criminals who are expansionist and want to build more settlments and grab more land.

"Where did Israelis “chase” Palestinians away to? The next hill over? They still literally live in Palestine. 

Meanwhile Jews have been chased away—and exterminated—from entire continents where they’ve lived for thousands of years. How are you going to pretend like you have some sort of moral high ground while you advocate for yet more ethnic cleansing of Jews. The Arab countries already did that to the Jewish communities that were already ancient even before the Arabs ever showed up; how many problems “disappeared” then?

And how did Arabs get there, anyway? Hint - it starts with a c… and ends in “olonization”—and expansionism, imperialism, conquest, subjugation, ethnic cleansing, genocide. 

It must really stick in your craw that Jews aren’t yours to kick around anymore, huh? It’s actually rather funny and pathetic that you still feel entitled to tell Jews our place, as if we give a shit the opining of what I can only assume at this point is an angry, socially maladroit, antisemitic European teenager (or at least I hope so, for your sake, given your demonstrated lack of general knowledge, reasoning skills, and emotional maladjustment).

"Im not israli and i dont live anywhere near middle east. So im not exactly afraid of what they will do to me. 

But to answer your question, yes in a way israel is to blame as to why people might view them with hate. But thats not to say that islam on general isnt hateful towards jews. Yes israel is a terrible neighbour. So were most muslim countries back then. 

> Even though Israelis might deserve that, Palestinians largely voice that they want to live in peace on their land. Israel has refused them that since the early 1900s.



Important to note, the follwing argument isnt mine, they are mostly what i have gathered from israeli people when they are talking on the subject. Palestinians have proven time and time again that they dont want to live in peace considering every time there have come negotiations, they have refused them because they arent in good faith. In addition to that, they commonly used gaza as a base to launch rockets into israel. This lead to the occupation of gaza. 

>  Maybe actually stop settlers from killing and harassing them to steal more land? Or lift the military occupation and give them equality? 

Im pretty sure there is still a palestinian population in israel. And as far as i can tell, there is equality among people in israel, meaning an arab and a israeli have the same rights. 

>  There is real, raw racism baked into the way you perceive Arabs. You need to ask yourself why that is to start to change things.

Oh nonono. I dont have a problem with arabs. I have a problem with islam and what that usually entails.

"“I know you are but what am I?” That Israelis supposedly want all of historic Palestine is demonstrably false.

If so, based on what evidence?

I wasn’t the original commenter, but it shows they don’t want to peacefully coexist with Israel (reject two-state solution, support Jihadist groups that want to wipe out Israel). Where are you getting this idea that they somehow want to coexist in a secular democracy? 

Half of Palestinians support 1967 borders *as a temporary measure* until they can conquer Israel. When asked if they support those borders as a permanent solution, requiring them to forever give up all claim to Israel, they don’t support it. Of course Israel doesn’t support returning all land. You can’t keep starting and losing wars and expect to keep all land and just be left alone. It hasn’t worked like that for any territory for 10,000 years.

">>What genocide? 
The one Israel is committing?

>>What makes Israel war on Hamas a genocide but not a y current or past Middle Eastern conflict a genocide? 

…Because Hamas hasn’t murdered 10% of the Israeli population? 

>>I've looked into your profile not a mention of Yemen with 400,000+ dead a genocide, No mention of Sudan genocide, or Syria with over 1,000,000 deaths a genocide yet Israel with less than 30,000 where at least 5,000 are Hamas combatants is automatically a genocide.

It is a genocide. If you want details just check the icj or the UN. What does it tell you when the entire world is actually turning their back on this sad excuse for a country? 

I am not funding the others. I am not actively giving weapons and aid to any of those other places. So yeah you got me, I am a little more invested in this one. Also the others don’t make my country look like shit to the world so there is that.

"Can you list a single other conflict in which millions of civilians of side A have been literally walled into a ghetto, unable to escape, while being bombed relentlessly by aide B, and then had food and medicine cut off, like a medieval siege, all while the commanders of B openly state their intention to starve and wipe out the other side A?

The only other example that comes to mind is the Warsaw ghetto, so your inability to even consider the genocidal qualities of this conflict is highly suspect, especially in light of the lancet’s estimation of ~180,000 casualties and the fact that Israel now stands trial formally for genocide at the highest court in the world.

"You know, it’s a funny thing, confirmation bias.  We read reports and posts filtered by our own prejudices and paradigms for understanding.  OP has bulletized a number of supposed conclusions from this report (prepared for the U.K. military as a strategy review of urban warfare) that seem to reflect the prevailing U.S. mindset: the war is going poorly for the IDF, they are stymied by Hamas, too many civilian casualties, etc. etc.

So I read the Executive Summary of the report and come to find it more supports the conclusions suggested by u/icecreamraider in his “Realities of War” series last month: that despite doubts and a historically formidable defense strategy of underground tunnels and human shields, the IDF has risen to the occasion and dismantled Hamas militarily, learning new and more effective tactics for this uniquely difficult war.

Here’s what I found in the Executive Summary which seems to support my frame (sorry, report or browser not allowing copy/paste quotes, so I’m summarizing):

- IDF figured out how to conduct underground and surface battles simultaneously for greatest effect;

- IDF figured out tactical approaches to tall buildings, rubble and identified problems with comms ;

- IDF able to defeat close combat ambushes by Hamas, lessons here for British military in echelon formation.

- IDF able to suppress Hamas effectively due to air power cover, lessons for British.

- Humanitarian situation disasterous because Hamas doesn’t practice “distinction” thus civilians necessarily harmed and because Hamas intentionally restricts or controls aid for its own political and military goals, not sure whether there are any “lessons” here.

This doesn’t sound like an army which was defeated or stalemated, but one winning against an enemy that ideologically admit cannot defeat and considers their dead civilians as a benefit, not something to be avoided and defended against.

Don't tell me you're naive and ignorant enough to believe that Israelis have only suffered and been attacked by Palestinians on October 7th because it's not true. There have been many other times too. October 7th is just the most well-known.

Don't talk about Israel if you're not familiar with our history. Palestinians haven't suffered the most here. Sure, you could argue that more Palestinians have died (Due to the fact Hamas military capabilities actually sucks) but to determine who has faced more violence or ""suffered more"" between Israel and Palestine is impossible.

Even the BBC, stenographers for Israel that they are, had to call out the obvious lies. Remember when Daniel Hagari pointed at a calendar and said it was a terrorist list? Remember when Israel doctored the footage of one of their massacres to make it look like a guy was shooting an AK-47? Remember when Israel hired an actress to pretend to be a nurse at All Shifa to make a TikTok about how Hamas was in the hospital? If you're going to give ""concrete proof"" you have to first convince me it isn't doctored or fabricated since Israel lies and fabricates evidence to justify their atrocities CONSTANTLY.

“any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; [and] forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.""

Okay first of all I am atheist so whatever religious texts you use to prove a point will be lost on me. Second, I agree that Jews along with Christians, Muslims, and whatever other religions have a right to be there under the assumption they bought the land that they are on. This is where I feel like Israel is wrong.

Absolutely, they were and it was a tragic part of human history. Now though that does not justify
Jews displacing another group of people.

Wrong.

"That's ridiculous. You can believe Israel shouldn't be destroyed while opposing its current government. Many Israelis strongly oppose Netanyahu and his policies. Support for a country's continued existence as a refuge, which is what many people's support boils down to, doesn't equate to support for every single government policy. And to some of your previous points, not all of Israel is stolen land. Jews legally bought land during Ottoman times, from local Arabs, including Tel Aviv which was established long before Israel's existence - in 1909 on empty sand dunes north of Jaffa (which is still there), so no Arabs were displaced to build Tel Aviv. And yet some extremists consider even Tel Aviv ""stolen land"".

"Stop rewriting History to justify your colonization 


""The Labour Zionist leader and head of the Yishuv David Ben-Gurion was not surprised that relations with the Palestinians were spiralling downward. As he once explained: ‘We, as a nation, want this country to be ours; the Arabs, as a nation, want this country to be theirs.’ His opponent, Ze’ev Jabotinsky, leader of the right-wing Revisionist movement, also viewed Palestinian hostility as natural. ‘The NATIVE POPULATIONS, civilised or uncivilised, have always stubbornly resisted the colonists’, he wrote in 1923. The Arabs looked on Palestine as ‘any Sioux looked upon his prairie’.""

""In the words of Mordechai Bar-On, an Israel Defense Forces company commander during the 1948 war:

‘If the Jews at the end of the 19th century had not embarked on a project of reassembling the Jewish people in their ‘promised land’, all the refugees languishing in the camps would still be living in the villages from which they fled or were expelled.’""

Based on what do zionists have a claim?  A holy book... and at what point does my group briefly conquered and ruled a region means you have an eternal right to genocide the people actually living there?  Does Rome have a right to the land as well?

Here is a quote from my Jewish learning

""I say “mythical” because the Jewish claim that we are descendants of tribes that lived on the border of Africa and Asia some 4,000 years ago is also mythic. Can we really believe that a diverse modern community, which has been dispersed for more than two millennia and has come to look very much like the peoples among whom they reside, are all direct descendants of a single group of ancient tribes? In other words, can we really still buy the myth of the historical authenticity of contemporary Jewish identity?""

All told, more than 80 percent of the maternal lineages of Ashkenazi Jews could be traced to Europe, with only a few lineages originating in the Near East.

And now they’re building more and more settlements in the West Bank, with the intention of eventually kicking out all the Palestinians there. 

And then they’ll move on to Jordan, then Lebanon, Syria, and then the entire  Semitic world won’t even really exist.

Here are some recent Arabs holding the highest positions in Israel.  The comparison speaks volumes!  But keep yelling about apartheid and genocide, the world believes you.

">Israel is not a democracy,  it is an ethnocracy that is practicing the crime of apartheid on palestinans.

Israel is a true democracy and ranks higher than 100% of Arab countries in term of freedoms according to every major research group. This includes the 2 million Muslim citizens.

>Zionists militas did deir yassin massacre on 9th of April 1948, almost two months before the “arab attack” which took place in 14th May 1948.

Arabs in the levant destroyed Jewish villages multiple times over the centuries. Literally they they would riot and kill Jews every time a child went missing because they think we drink baby blood (blood is not kosher btw for the record and it’s never ok to eat humans).

The grand mufti of Jerusalem LITERALLY met with Hitler to discuss him eventually coming to deal with the Jews.

>Meanwhile 1 MILLION jews were ethnically cleansed from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Afghanistan, Yemen, and more.

>How is this the problem of Palestinians? Why should palestinians “pay” for it?

Because they are Muslim Arabs, half those countries are in the levant. And the Arab league especially Egypt Syria Jordan Lebanon etc went to war with Israel in 1948 resulting in the loss you refer to as the nakba.

>It’s like saying that I want to punish the French people because the Swiss,  the germans and the Spanish did something bad to me. (Since they all are eurpeans).

Literally no. The plan of the Zionists was to live in Israel and create a state for Jews legally through land purchased with minimal displacement of the natives and accepting those natives who are likeminded and share values. Literally Israel could have kicked out 100% of Palestinians from Israel but they did not. They also kept 100% of the Druze and even invited every Druze in all sorts to move in including the Golan heights. 

>What is more, it’s not a one unifed event. Morroco for instance banned jews from leaving morroco to israel .. but they still immigrated because israel presented itself as their true home.

Israel is our true home. We come from Judea, we speak Hebrew and Judea Aramaic, and Jerusalem has been our qibla for 2000 years. Also there were massacres of Jews all over the Arab world but don’t worry I’ll post another comment listing them if you ask for it. Since you brought up Deir Yassin as if insane extremists Arabs don’t exist in much higher number than that of Jews.

>Palestinians are NOT Jordanians. Why would a Palestinian born in Haifa,  his grand father born in Haifa..etc.. why should he leave so that a jewish person from Ukraine,  Poland,  yemen or Ethiopia go and live there?

Before it was called Jordan it was literally called Palestine.  Then it was called trans Jordan. Then it was called Jordan. The hashemites who rule Jordan aren’t even from there. Also there was no such thing as Palestinian Arabs before 1967 except as defined by the British. There were various tribes that self identified by tribal affiliation. Arabs in Gaza are completely different from Arabs in Galilee. Also literally at least half of Jordanians identify as Palestinian TODAY. So yes Jordan is a Palestinian country. Imagine if a country had a 50% population of Jews and I pretended it wasn’t a Jewish country. Jeez Louise 

>Israel is the ONLY jewish state and the historic homeland of the jews who are from JUDEA

>This doesn’t give israel any special rights to ethnically cleanse palestinans,  kill them or torture them.

I agree. I’m against ethnic cleaning and torture. I want all people of Canaanite descent including Jews and Palestinian Arabs to live together happily in peace.

>In 1939, British empire proposed the white paper. They wanted to create a multi-ethnic state with equal rights between arabs and Jewish immigrants.

>Palestinans said YES, zionists said NO and started a civil war killing both arabs and brits.

Of course they rejected it. Arabs convinced the British to create trans Jordan in 1921 and then they convinced the British to go against the Balfour declaration and the white paper limited jewish immigration to Israel to 75,000 people. You think they should have accepted that? In 1939 Jews were increasingly in danger all over Europe. We BADLY needed safe haven. Over the next 10 years 6,000,000 Jews died. Literally TODAY there are 1 million less Jews in the world than in 1939.

>Zionist terrorist group Lehi for instance did bombing of King david hotel in July 1946 killing dozens of innocent people

Lehi was terrible so were the various extremist Arab groups who destroyed Jewish villages all over Israel/palestine and the levant in general. You think we forget about things that happened in the past? Every year we don’t eat bread for 8 days to remember what Ramses did to us 4000 years ago. We still remember what Mohammad did to the Jews of Medina. We remember what the various caliphs did, the conversions, the sex slaves, all of it. We are a minority all over the world. Europeans, Arabs, Catholics, and Muslims are the majority who have persecuted minorities for generations until they converted and assimilated as much as possible. There are literally hundreds of subcultures and languages that have gone extinct because of Muslim conquest. Tell me how many cultures, religions, and languages Jews have destroyed? Our religion has zero desire to do this. We don’t believe everyone who doesn’t practice our religion is going to jahanam. We don’t believe every needs to speak Hebrew. 

Literally Israel is full of mosques playing namaz 5 times a day on loudspeakers. The government literally funds schools to teach Arabic and Arab culture to Arabs . They do not at all try to judaize anyone because we don’t believe that is right.",r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYzJ2dWpNODVsWkN5VXVKYjd5NUIxZDR4RENHblVpRlF0ckFsem1od1VGb2Z1a1gzVVVwNXpEUzBFeTRJUF93eWN5eUZyekJkRUhqc3F6dFFTdlh3NHc9PQ==

"Yep, sounds like the Jews ran from happy harmonious lives…
“Between 23,000 and 25,000 Jews are estimated to have left Egypt between November 1956 and the end of 1958.[10] By 1957, more than 6,000 left by ship with assistance of International Red Cross. Other relief groups, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS, the Central British Fund the Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) and the Jewish Agency helped refugees resettle in Israel, Western Europe, the US, Central and South America and Australia. UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld was said to have interceded to soften the harsh treatment meted out to departing Jews.[11] There were so many Jews leaving Egypt, and some were in such distress that, for the first time, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Dr Auguste Lindt, recognised Jews departing Egypt as bona fide refugees under his aegis.

In 1957, a grant of US $30,000 was allocated to provide ‘emergency aid’ to Jewish refugees from Egypt. This funding was granted on condition that that there would be absolutely no publicity given. The grant was later converted into a loan, and the Joint Distribution Committee paid back the US $30,000 to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.”

"And it is people like you who have no education which makes it very difficult. You are supporting the ""Israel should not exist"" narrative which means there will never be a solution. As long as the Palestinians continue with narrative, and westerners like you support it - then Palestinians will continue to demand everything and terrorist like Hamas will continue killing Israeli civilians in their goal of eradicating Israel. 

It isn't about ""how Israel was created"" which is not acceptable to them, it is that ""Israel exists"" that isn't acceptable to them. It wasn't acceptable in 1947 and it still isn't today- at least not by the leadership.

>Is that reeducation going to change the facts of what Israel has done to them every day over the past 9 months?

No. It is going to change the reason this war happened. If Hamas accepted Israel and wanted to find a solution which included accepting Israel, then October 7th wouldn't have happened and there would have been no war to remove Hamas from Gaza.

>oh that's fine, yeah we deserved all of this over the past 75 years because specific factions of us committed terrorism in the 1920s; it was fine to create Israel and displace ALL of us because oh 2000 years ago the Romans conquered and displaced Jewish people. 

It seems you need education about the history of the region. But honestly, it isn't helping the solution. Either you accept Israel exists and is here to stay or there is no conversation to be had.

>Would it have been acceptable for Palestinians to airstrike Baruch Goldstein's neighborhood after the Hebron massacre

You don't seem to grasp the reality of the situation. Israel was attacked by the government of Gaza. It was a cross border raid by a military. And that military has entrenched itself in Gaza's civilian neighborhoods. To ignore this fact is to ignore reality.

">And Arabs only owned 9% of the land in mandatory Palestine. Most of the lands are owned by the state.

Yes. And once we add this information to the mix, the fact that Israel's founding constituted taking land from people who lived there continues to be true, and so the question of why sharing an ethnicity with the local population gives you the right to do that continues to be relevant.

>Because your statement was confusing. The right to move is irrelevant. Jews have the rights to set up their own country in mandatory Palestine and they don't have to prove anything. 

Who else has the right to set up a country there? If a population of immigrants wanted to move there and found a country today, would Israel calmly negotiate the new borders, or do something ridiculous like use force to try to prevent it? 

>Israel has been recognized as a sovereign state under international law.

So has Palestine.

>You mean Israel wants to seize Gaza and absorb millions of hostile population who would be funded by its taxpayers? 

No. If I meant that I would have said it, or said something that implied it. But I didn't.

>More claim. You don't have to believe it. They are capable of doing that and have done that.

Show proof that Israel has previously removed hundreds of thousands of settlers from settlements.

>So what makes you think Israelis want to annex all area C of West Bank with hundreds of thousands Palestinians living there who don't want to be a part of Israel?

The massive ongoing expansion of settlements makes me think that Israel wants to take large amounts of land from Area C by expanding settlements. It is objectively true that Israel is doing this in order to attempt to acquire more territory. Look up whether or not the people in charge of doing it have directly stated this is why they are doing it, for example.

>For me, I still think it is laughable. They want their grandfathers' land back, then what? All of them live in Israel, a country that they hate?

Yes, you do think this. Like I already said, you believe it to be laughable in one of the two circumstances and understandable in the other. This is because you do not have consistent principles. I see both as nonviable options and don't see the logic in a system that allows you to *personally* claim land back if you were not born there and didn't grow up there. In the case of Area C it should be Palestine because it was intended to be and because Israel's aggressive expansionism beyond its internationally recognised borders and violation of the Geneva convention by moving its own population onto occupied territory should be rejected on principle and to not set a precedent of allowing landgrabs by states.

>Can you find out in the internet the percentage of Israeli settlement in the Area C, and what is the majority of the land used for?

Not really interested in your long winded version of the socratic method. Just make the actual point you want to make by saying it in words.

>First, you have to show a proof that I claimed Israel has offered to return Area C in any negotiations.

The proof is the part of your previous comment where you said that the Palestinians have to sit and negotiate if they want Area C. For this to be a possible option for them, it has to be plausible that Israel are willing to offer Area C. If they were, they would have previously offered Area C, and so this is the only rational interpretation of your previous claim.",r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYVlKc3VLT2dNSDZyMWJ6d2NsMFRvMUN2OEJjRGY4dDZFam92VkdTbVVHWXRRNGRiQm9qYklkN2NTY1c1MUcxRkhGN0lVdzN6MDhUTUlUeXpDa2t0dWJVaTJldTdzYy1BV2hHTVI1ZkhjcFU9

"*-Even if you believe the land belonged to the British and they have the right to give it to Jews from every part of the word*

They literally did have that right. This isn't some theoretical ""even if you believe."" It's not about belief; the entirety of that land literally belonged to the British. Palestinians didn't own any of it.

And because of such, there was nothing illegal about the Brits (with the help of the U.N) *partitioning off their own land* how they saw fit. Which in the original partition included the prioritization of giving Palestinians sovereignty/statehood where they already lived. The partition plan was for Pali's to own everything around Jerusalem and the West Bank, the entire Northern tip, Gaza, and a huge swath of land South of Gaza - aka all of where Palestinians *already resided* en masse.

There was less than 800,000 Palestinians living there at the time of the British partition FFS, and they were offered to rule over nearly 50% of all that land (it was a generous deal.) Jerusalem would be an international holy city that anyone could have access to. And then the remaining land (mostly rural) would be given to neighboring Jews...

And there was *also* a measure in place for a currency & economic system which would bridge the two countries. It was a plan that was meant to be a harmonious union between the two ethic groups who are ingenious to the land; so that they could both have their own political and religious autonomy, but also work together in other ways, such as bridging their economies.

Imagine hating Jews so much that instead of having your own statehood & economic/political sovereignty for the very first time outside of British rule, that you launch a massive war and then spectacularly lose that war.

"Pro Palestine people

1. what made you become pro Palestine? Originally middle eastern. Have alot of friends (and their parents) that have suffered tremendously over the last 75 years or so. Also, aware of Western meddling and imperialism in region in general (Iraq war, Afghanistan) etc. I think I just tend empathise with the underdog.
2. who should be running Palestine as the leader? I'm not sure. Mustafa Barghouti seems decent but then again you would need someone who's diplomatic and smart enough to undo decades of resentment and segregation to allow peace to prevail.
3. what concessions are you willing to make for peace? It can be still 'Israel', though palestinians need be humanised and have way more rights than they currently do,  they currently live like second class citizens. 
4. do you have pro Israel friends? If so how is taking the conflict been with them? Yes, it was very difficult in the first couple of months since oct7 (rightly so). They started grouping palestinians and arabs together and categorising them as animals (when its actually decades of oppression and colonialism that results in radicalisation - not being a terrorist sympathiser here, they most definitely are a terrorist group, i'm just saying i understand how they came about ((not withstanding bibi's arming and funding of them)).
5. what criticisms do you have of your own side? plenty. racism against ALL israelis and jews. telling them to go back to europe when a good chunk of them are native middle easterns (there was always jews in ME). radical islamists branding as 'resistance'.
6. any pro Israel person you watch that you respect even if you don’t entirely agree with them? I've seen a number of different podcasts from both sides since oct 7. Some made respectful and good points, others not so much (cough cough ben shapiro)
7. how did you feel seeing the October 7th footage? horrendous sight. shame. fear how it was going to muddle the cause.
8. what sources or Twitter users do you follow for the conflict? i follow a number of different podcasts (mostly) from both sides. helps me see the context and elaborate points as opposed to short and snappy ones.
9. do you consider Hamas a terrorist org? yes
10. do you separate Israelis from their government? Some extreme supporters don’t do that. ofcourse, its only a small portion of israelis that support bibi's government anyways. i think he needs to go.

"There has never been a *Palestinian* state. So, there is no right to get one. Ask the Igbo Jews in Nigeria who are being persecuted today who have tried to start a state for over 50-years in their homeland. It’s actually similar since the British messed up that land as well. We can see that people don’t indeed have a right to start their own state. Like the OP said, some people lost a war. They have even less of a case than the Igbo in Nigeria since it took them decades to claim “Palestine” was a country. They could’ve agreed to the 1947 UN partition plan and didn’t.

They’re getting their butts kicked trying to start their own state. The situation in Israel is similar. If you try to start a state with force and you don’t win, you don’t get a state.

"Indeed. It goes in circles in these conversations. Israelis have this problem/excuse? Well what about this problem/excuse for the Palestinians which has almost exactly the same ideology or reasoning? Hypocrisy and an unwillingness to admit the wrongs of the side you pick is what keeps this cycle going. As the old saying goes, if they put down their guns, there would be no war. 

Ultimately, this violence is serving a few people who benefit greatly from it. Hamas are islamists with a horrible ideology and it is very very clear that they are genocidal maniacs driven by religion and power. Israel is an oppressive regime that justifies its brutal actions through victimhood and a shared western fear of islamism. Both sides’ leadership is granted power, money, and influence. It serves them, personally, to make arms deals, political networks and military operations. And they have an army of global supporters cheering their bloodshed on in the name of ‘justice’. 

I wonder when the day will come that we realise Israelis and Palestinians are cousins who have been abused for decades. The only difference that I see is quality of life due to particular alliances.

"I agree. I’ve had this idea for a while, but if Israel did more to bring back other lost tribes of Israel that are being persecuted, like Igbo Jews in Nigeria who are being murdered by radical Islamic extremists, it would give Israel more of a moral high ground to justify having a Jewish state. Israel saving other groups from religious persecution would highlight a reason why we need a state, and would make groups like Hamas that want to wipe us out look even worse if we highlighted the persecution that Jews go through globally.

As John Spencer, chair of urban warfare studies at West Point, puts it: “Given the scale and context of an enemy purposely entrenched in densely populated urban areas, as well as the presence of tunnels, hostages, rockets, attackers that follow the laws of war while defenders purposely do not, and proximity between the frontlines and the home front, there is basically no historical comparison for this war.” So far as a comparison to a different battle or war  can be offered, Spencer notes that in the Battle of Mosul it took “over 100,000 Iraqi Security Forces backed by American advisers and U.S. and coalition air power…nine months to clear a city of 3,000 to 5,000 lightly armed ISIS fighters. The battle resulted in over 10,000 civilian deaths, 138,000 houses destroyed or damaged…Iraqi Security  Forces suffered 10,000 casualties. There were limited, shallow, house-to-house tunnels, but no tunnel networks, no hostages, no rockets.” ",r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaWi1BTGxoaUx0RXI2cUtpT2hmUDJGZjRIWnlQUy1jTGFXOU51T3F6VE9GRHpKX2JxZm5XMTdTRUEyM2pNYzE2ZjNKdjFmeXZUMy0xM01NZmlEdFRNV1E9PQ==

"The legal answer to your question is no, Israel can't just do whatever it wants to Palestinians because it won the war (kick them out, etc.). It's a violation of international law and norms.

  
Essentially what you're arguing though is that ""might makes right"", which we realized after many horrific wars is not a good way to address conflict, hence the aforementioned international law prohibiting this kind of behavior. The other problem with this outlook is that it cuts both ways. Israel has the power to stop Palestinians from ever having a state, and it has the power to expel Palestinians from their land. On the flip side, groups like Hamas (well maybe not so much now), Hezbollah and Iran have the power to continue attacking and killing Israeli's. So just because you have the power to do these things, it doesn't mean it's morally justified or that you should, and in many cases it just leads to more conflict.",r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNadDdfbEQ3cGJmdjBXZE9jeTEzMVN1ZU1tNTVLWThJSHJNTWcxb0xKMUh5Z05POGVaZFhDa2NmUEVCaFFpNF9Lc2FlZnhTWnRPNXQ4cmViWE0zZzRiRnc9PQ==

"That’s exactly the thing, Israelis don’t care how someone would “justify” terrorism. They merely try to defend themselves. 

During active hostilities, it’s easy to forget how much of what Israel does is purely defensive in nature. With onset of rocket attacks from Gaza, instead of destroying Hamas, Israel invested into developing air defenses. When Hamas signaled they were tentatively ready to turn from attacking Israel to administering Gaza, Israel facilitated funding from Qatar (today Palestinian supporters turn this into “Israel funded Hamas”). Only 9 days before the massacre, Israel and Hamas agreed on de-escalation. Prior to the war, Israel was constantly condemned for security checkpoints in WB, the most effective anti-terrorist measure. And so on. 

Few people remember today Israel’s operation in Jenin only a year ago. After a few days of heavy fighting with terrorists, the number of civilian casualties stood at *zero*. The result? Israel was condemned for “second Nakba” (because it requested population to leave for a few days) and “bullet holes in buildings”. I wish was joking…

"I do keep up with the situation in Israel and Palestine and have done for many years now. Knowing what I know, I’m aware that Palestinian leadership has deflected every possible avenue for peace and that on a mass scale, Israel does what it can. That was my general position before the shitshow of 7/10. 

However. I cannot watch children die, starved, bombed, shot, and tell myself it’s ‘necessary’. We should never get to that point and if we *have* to, the first possible moment of peace should be grasped and enforced. Without outside forces constantly meddling, advising and funding, I don’t believe Hamas would have as much global influence as they do. They are funded by Iran, and supported by people globally because first and foremost, the amount of death and suffering is so painful to watch. And they make sure you watch it while creating a political position which involves dehumanising and ignoring all Zionist perspectives. 

Non-Jewish Zionists tend to have a special interest in defeating Hamas, who are a figurehead for islamism. While yes, we should do everything to end islamism, many are simply Islamophobic. The money is in Israel and that’s why powerful countries and tech billionaires support them. It’s all very superficial. Let’s not forget the Christian Zionists of America, who are only hoping to put Jews in Israel so they can bring about the second coming. 

My point in saying all this is that outside meddling results in an ironically uneducated population with very, very strong opinions that are generally not based in fact. They always have a counter argument and will not listen, and encourage the killing of their enemy while crying when their own are killed. I simply hope for us to be reasonable people who say ‘yes, I understand why Israel does what it does, condemn the bad, and do the same for Palestinian leadership’ instead of going insane over lies and manipulations.

"Your comparison is incorrect. This is a war between Israel and Hamas. This isn't a ""terrorist"" attack on civilians no matter what some would like you to believe. 

Furthermore, the tens of thousands of missiles sent by Hamas against Israel citizens did not cause tens on thousands of casualties because of the Iron Dome and shelters. Israel has sent a considerable amount in securing it's civilians. That doesn't dismiss the regular attacks by Hamas putting hundred of thousands in fear or rockets landing on them.

And then there are regular attempts of terror attacks blocked by checkpoint and blockades.

Israel is always seen as ""not suffering"" because it has grown very good at protecting itself. Often that protection comes at a price to the Palestinians. All the world sees is the price the Palestinians pay and ignore how we got there.

"If you're actually military -- competent military -- you probably know the phrase, ""big hand small map"". You also probably know the how war is usually understood on several different layers -- strategic, operational, and tactical.

How Israel has managed this conflict on a strategic level is not good. This is an excerpt from a conversation with an American lone soldier and an older Israeli citizen.

https://archive.is/3TL4R

> One woman whose age I don’t want to guess, but clearly had a ton of life experience, was telling me a bit about her life when I asked her when the first time she came to Israel was.

> “1956,” she informed me with a knowing grin.

> **She kept repeating a sentence, “It was very peaceful back then, not like today.”**

> “Did people interact with their Arab neighbors though?”

> “Oh yes! Many people even spoke Arabic and they were quite friendly with each other. It wasn’t until the 1967 war (the 6 Day War) that this changed. Before then it was different. There wasn’t an occupation then.”

First point of note here, the security picture has deteriorated dramatically over time, despite Israel being far more established and capable as a state. Continuing on :

> Post massage I was enjoying a smoke with a couple of other American lone soldiers when one of the masseuses, who had lived in Chicago and spoke great English, joined our little smoking circle and began demanding of us one thing:

> “You’re all staying in Israel after this, right?”

> The awkward truth is that none of us were planning on staying in Israel after all this. I can and will go into this in detail at a later time but in summary, and what I told her was, that I didn’t want my now one-year-old son to have to grow up and join the IDF in what was clearly an endless war.

> “We don’t have a choice,” she insisted in response, “my boys can already shoot a bow and arrow. They will grow up and fight. We only have one place to live where we are safe. What else can we do?”

> This is the Israel of today, where mothers are ready to sacrifice their children to a war machine whose hunger will never be satisfied. 

> For some reason, hearing her say this reminded me of the Jonestown mass suicide in 1978 when nearly one thousand people willingly killed themselves out of loyalty to a home and way of life.

> Men, women, old, young. Mothers even fed their babies the poison to ensure they would die together. I always wondered how these parents could do such a thing. Yet, here I was talking to a woman who was boasting about her children’s fighting prowess and proudly declaring that they would be warriors in an endless Jewish jihad from which they could not hope to escape.

There are religious currents in Israeli society that can't be dismissed, which fundamentally alters how Israel pursues war on a strategic level. We really need to start paying more attention to that.

https://merip.org/2019/12/toward-religious-zionist-hegemony-in-israel/

> Religious Zionism, despite its relatively modest electoral clout, has become a powerful ideological formation in contemporary Israel and is now in a favorable position to establish cultural hegemony over Jewish Israeli society as a whole.

> Following the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, Rabbi Kook forbade giving up any part of the Land of Israel which he believes is granted to the People of Israel by God. This prohibition provided the ideological basis for Gush Emunim, the Israeli settler movement that succeeded in transforming the demography of the West Bank and making the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict obsolete.

This kind of territorial maximalism is something closer to what you'd see in Serbia. Not NATO, and certainly not the 5EYES countries. This renders a realistic acceptable endstate -- negotiated peace with the Palestinians -- out of the question. So Israel has been reduced to absolutely absurd tactical measures like roof knocking to try not to alienate foreign support, because they have no path to victory on a strategic level which the international community could possibly accept. The strategic logic is absolutely incoherent in Israel to accommodate this religious-nationalist imperative, as if civilian settlements in the West Bank somehow create security. On October 7th, something like 35 battalions were deployed towards Judea and Samaria, while something like 3 protected the Gaza border.

> other tactics that seem absurd even to the most restrained NATO forces, such as calling civilian mobiles warning before a strike, the use of leaflets to move civilians to safety

These tactics are absurd because NATO fields expeditionary forces working to attain achievable political goals, rather than trying to institutionalize permanent occupation with a minimal troop presence. To be fair, Israel is the most advanced country in the world at achieving this questionable goal. It has brought Israel nothing but misery.

So let's emphasize that point again. “Israel in 1956 Used to be a Peaceful Place”.

"You missed the point. You were comparing only Israeli casualties to terror attack numbers and ignored all the wars Israel fought. There is a general mindset to ignore actions by the rest if the Arab states against Israel over the last hundred years.

The fact that some have signed peace treaties with Israel doesn't change their history in this conflict. 

>Fear of dying from rockets (which by the way, people in Gaza also experience) < actually dying from rockets.

Actually,  Gaza don't experience rockets randomly sent at them. Israel has never instigated an attack against Gaza. It has always been a reaction to Hamas attacking Israel. It is only duration one of those reactions that the Gazans have real fear of rockets.

">There are more than 65 laws that discriminate against arab israelis. They are at best 2nd class citizens.

Every country has issues with discrimination. Israel has less issues with discrimination than every single Arab and Muslim country in the world. Palestinians have mentioned several times they don’t want Jews to live in a future Palestinian state.

>They wanted to create a Jewish majority state on an already populated land with or without the consent of the locals.

“Already populated” is BS. People were migrating in and out and moving around all the time. Case in point is that Jews used to be populated there and were forcibly removed. Those 800k were living under ottoman rule and the population significantly increased after Jews started moving there starting at the end of the 1800s. 

>They ethnically cleansed 800k palestinan from their homes. An event documented in UN resolution 194 (iii).

The UN is severely biased against Jews and did not document or care about the displacement of the Jews. 

>15th of may is an official nakba day in UN.

The nakba was the result of Arab rejection of Jews and subsequent war and attempt at genocide. Arab states outnumber Israel in the UN and use their natural resources as leverage to pressure other states to vote against Jews. Arab states have atrocious human rights records compares to Israel. Orders of magnitude more people have been displaced by Arabs than by Jews. Even now 20 MILLION people were displaced in Sudan.

>Jordan is not palestine. Different countries with different people.

Before is was called Jordan it was called Transjordan, and before Transjordan the region was Palestine. More than half of the people living in Jordan are Palestinian. The hashemite rulers are not natives.

>And 47 partion plan wanted to divide the land which meant Palestinians would lose their homes. It also had a section saying thst 200k Palestinian must be removed from the jewish part. You think palestinans should accept that ?

Yes, I think if they would have accepted it then less people would die and there would be peace. Being displaced 10 miles away is more humane than allowing millions to die.

>It is a fact that Jews lived peacefully under Muslim rule. Jews experienced their golden age in muslim Spain. Hundreds of jewish scientists , politicans , rabbis and philosphers came from Muslim Spain.

It is not “a fact”. We were at best tolerated. There were good times and there were plenty of bad times. My entire community in Mashhad Iran was forced to convert.

>Although islamic civliazation wasnt perfect...but antisemtisim is a eurpean problem.

Today antisemitism is a Muslim problem more than a European problem. You think a Jew dressed fully as a Jew is safer in a random Arab country than in Europe? The vast majority of hate crimes against Jews in Europe and the U.S. are made by Muslims. 

>It is a fact now that Jews killed Muslims more than what Muslims killed from Jews in the last 1400 years.

Hahahhahahahhahahahahbagahahahahhahhahahahahahahhahhhahaaaaaaaaa. That’s absolutely insane. Look at the population of Jews in Muslim countries over the past 1400 years. If Jews would DARE resist Islamic rule we would be exterminated immediately.

>In the latest Gaza genocide , the lancet are saying thst 186k were killed by israel.

Even of the number is 40k... it doesn’t come close to the number of Jews killed by muslims in the last 1400 years of Islam.

Yes because there are less Jews in the world than Muslims. So when Muslims kill a million people during their conquests you can say they “only killed a few Jews”. How many people have been killed in the name of Islam in the past 1500 years vs by Jews?

>Thsts a form of racism ro assume that Palestinians are same as lebanese , morrocans..etc

Palestinians are not the “same” as morrocans but Galilee Palestinians are closer to Lebanese than to Gazans. Also even though not the same they practice the same religion and speak the same language.

>What is more, they are culturally arab but ethnically thry are diverse people.

Never denied this 

>Morrocans are amazigh , lebanese are ethnically phoenicians..etc

I know, but also when I do genetic testing it says Phoenicians/canaanite peoples ancestries are mixed. You already rejected this above and called me obsessed.

>In order for this to happen , the radicalist settler ideology of zionism needs to be rejected or be reformed. Israeli government must pay compensations for Palestinian refugees for their stolen homes.

This cannot and will not happen with Hamas in power because it’s against their ideology. It’s also against Irans ideology as well and they are the local superpower. Believe it or not Israelis would LOVE to live beside a peaceful country of Arabs. As soon as UAE normalized everyone started visiting. 

>For sure, palestinan side also needs to work on it and de-radicalize. But the main oppressor (israel) is the one thst needs to be reformed because it is the main source of violence and the one thst had monopoly over violence.

Israel is not the main source of violence. It’s a progressive and diverse country without a death penalty and with protections for all of its people including Arabs. It’s a country where Arab Muslims can go on national TV and call Netanyahu a donkey. An Arab judge is able to start criminal proceedings against Netanyahu. If Palestinian militant groups would not fire rockets into Israel, Israel would have zero reason to ever attack.

">Most of the lands that were partitioned for Israel is Jewish-owned + state land + desert.

>Most of the lands partitioned for Arabs are mostly owned by Arabs. 

But actually hundreds of thousands of people were already living in that land before most of the Jewish population who founded Israel moved there. Why don't you know this already?

>Partitioned Arab states also include Jewish-owned land. Do also say that Arabs taking land from people who lived there?

Jewish people who were expelled did have their land taken. This was also wrong in the same way as the Nakba.

>Weren't Arabs also allocated a country for them in the mandatory?

Well, yes, but they already lived there. That's quite normal.

>You should do you homework first. When Jews migrated to the mandatory, Palestine was just a region controlled by Ottoman and later British, not a sovereign country. 

Thanks, I already knew this but don't accept the right for immigrants to move somewhere and seize control over the land people already live on, so wanted you to justify it. You don't see to be able to so far.

>You want to create a new country? You can. First, you need to find a land that hasn't been claimed by any country. After you have found it, you came here and I'll guide you the next step.

If a country fell apart tomorrow, for instance Russia, and so a population from somewhere else in the world decided to move to one region of Russia and seize control over it, and kindly inform the people living there that the immigrant population were their new rulers, would you support that then?

>I don't have to show you a proof since Israel hasn't withdrew from West Bank. 

>Israel has evacuated hundreds of thousands Israelis from the north, they also can evacuate hundreds of thousands Israelis from West Bank if they want to.

On a permanent basis? Then I look forward to you being proven right when Israel finishes withdrawing all settlers from the West Bank. Until then I'll obviously continue viewing the act of expanding settlements as aggressive expansionism, on the basis that it objectively is that.

>You confidently state about ""expanding settlement"" and make it like a truth without anything to back it up. So I was asking you to do the research firsthand so you can find out the answer that's easily found in the internet with few simple clicks on your own

I think what you're missing is that it doesn't matter how Israel legally wraps up the process of seizing land. Russia can also declare parts of Ukraine to be a firing zone or a nature reserve or somewhere where their citizens are moving of their own afford but coincidentally under Russian military protection. It is conquest in all of those forms. Which particular Israeli domestic law Israel chooses to write for the purpose of justifying the conquest of territory is irrelevant - unless you can point to the part of the Oslo Accords that specifically say Israel is allowed to seize additional territory by expanding settlements.

>It is even funnier when you said that. Because no one, including you, think the descendants of Middle Eastern Jews, Indian Muslims, Pakistani Hindus, and Sudeten Germans who were displaced in a much larger number should claim their grandfathers' lands. Only Palestinians. I am curious, why is that?

What? I can't tell if you've failed to read what I wrote when I said that I *don't* think Palestinians should be able to return to previous generations' homes in Israel, or if you're demanding I answer for the views of other people.

>""Area C"" means areas of the West Bank outside Areas A and B, which, except for the issues that will be negotiated in the permanent status negotiations, will be gradually transferred to Palestinian jurisdiction in accordance with this Agreement.

"You seem to be confused about the difference between a nation, a state, and a nation state.

The ancient kingdoms of Israel and Judah were states - they had defined borders and a government that exercised sovereignty over its territory.

They were not *nation states*. 

A nation is a group of people with shared identity, language, and culture (sometimes ethnicity). e.g. Jewish people are a nation. 

The nation-state is a modern phenomenon. It’s when a nation and a state coincide. Nation-states only appeared in the 19th century. 

There was no historical national nation-state of Israel, nor was there a nation-state of Palestine.

"> Israel didn’t do anything to make it a less peaceful pleasant place for Arabs

Israel has conducted the longest belligerent occupation on Earth. That's something.

Israelis struggle to be honest about this, because ending the occupation creates a rift between Israelis who prioritize a democratic state, and Israelis who prioritize a religious-nationalist mission to settle the biblical land of Israel. Most people outside Israel saw the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin as the act of a deranged radical in 1995. At this point, there's a reassessment that the killer was simply at the sharp end of an ultranationalist religious-political movement that has only grown stronger.

How are you going to blame the Arabs for this? Yasser Arafat didn't shoot Rabin, he shook his hand and pledged ""the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security"". Things fell apart, but it's not meaningless. That was put in writing and signed. The Arabs are not the only people to be looked at here, while Israelis make excuses for everything.

You want international support, fix your country. Don't try and fool westerners. It's insulting.",r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaY2JkYnVjT0VhWUJHSGxBT2VvRkltRDRYVWZfOHJXUFJuZk45Qko3ZGRVSG1PRmJxSjRPRkNnMXdQSjlTZ3U4cmoxZ2hRTFZDdFRxVFFaNUFGWk9qRVFGalhQRUJmUG9VNWtFVjlySlBHUVU9
"If that’s your position, that’s stop complaining about Oct 7th. That’s what occupation is. Occupiers die when the occupied fight back. If any other country occupied Israel and encroached on their land continually for 70 years with 700,000 illegal colonists and trapped 2 million Israelis in a ghetto controlling land, sea, air access plus water, electricity, their first concern would be to resist, violently.

The Warsaw ghetto rose up against their occupiers, and the Gaza ghetto did the same. The “drooling idiots” in Israel believe they can subjugate a people in perpetuity with zero consequences, and have been proven wrong at every turn.

Israel is a rogue state. A pariah on the world stage, an apartheid state, an occupier, and now maybe even a genocide perpetrator.

If your only response to tens of thousands of slaughtered children is “too bad”, you have zero rights to complain about the armed resistance to your grossly offensive occupation and subjugation of an entire people.

"I agree it’s about PR, but it’s not just that. My theory is that people are far more likely to know a Muslim person than they are to know a Jewish or Israeli person. This is because there are more than 100x more people who practice Islam in the world than Judaism. While there are Muslims who are not pro-Palestine, and Jews who are anti-Zionism, this is commonly not the case. Most Muslims are pro-Palestine. It is psychologically proven that the people that surround us highly impact our views and who we empathize with. All of this to say, I believe it is due to the sheer proportion of Muslims in the world (compared to the very small number of Jews) that many people now seem to be pro-Palestine. Biases are so important, and as a university student in Psychology, I can honestly say that our biases have more of an impact than we think, and they are failing us.

"""One need not have been Caesar in order to understand Caesar.""

Quick points to respond.

1) The October 7th attack is probably the worst single armed action in Israel's history, and the deadliest day for Jews as a whole since the Holocaust. The point you're making about conventional war doesn't address that Israelis used to be able to visit the West Bank and Gaza relatively safely, as tourists, go shopping, etc. This deterioration shouldn't be dismissed.

https://archive.is/Bz5aZ

> ""After the Six-Day War [in 1967], the expression 'knowing the land' was introduced,"" says the 76-year-old Ben Joseph. ""It's an almost erotic concept, like 'knowing' a woman [in the biblical sense of sexual relations]. People went on tours to get to know their new country. And just as they went to East Jerusalem, they also went to the Gaza Strip. There was no difference between Gaza and Rafah on the one hand and the Golan Heights and the Galilee on the other.""

2) ""Less religious"" doesn't mean religion doesn't exist. It's very well know Israel is growing more conservative and religious demographically, with the current government being the most right-wing, most religious, and most extreme in Israel's history. Otzma Yehudit, which sits in coalition, is the ideological successor of Kach which was banned in Israel in the 1980's for its antidemocratic and racist inclinations. Is Hamas more extreme? Of course. But that changes nothing written above.

3) I don't need to pretend to know what's going on. Israel's goals in Gaza were clear -- ""mow the lawn"", ""shrink the conflict"". This translates to institutionalize permanent occupation with a minimal troop presence. What other interpretation is possible? Of course Israelis don't all agree, I do grant you that. But Meretz doesn't drive the country. ""Security without Peace"" is the core of the Netanyahu doctrine and he's the longest-serving PM in Israel's history.

There was never a serious plan to make an independent Arab country — the concern of the Arab League and the local Arabs was that a weak, new Arab country run by the Grand Mufti would be conquered quickly by Israel.  

Uniting the West Bank with the Transjordan was a major policy of Abdullah I for years prior to 1947.

Basically, while they are different cultures now and have strayed geographically/culturally from their ancient roots, they come from the same source.

Hamas's military objective is to make it impossible to do so without killing civilians.  Sinwar calls it a necessary sacrifice that will lead to Hamas victory.

So it's actually Hamas - not me - that does not care about civilian deaths.

If Hamas did care about civilian lives, they would not violate the laws of armed conflict to shoot rockets next to them.  They would not violate the laws of armed conflict to hide underneath of them.  They would not hide their weapons in their homes and schools.  They would not establish bases in hospitals.

Note that Israel does not do these things.  This is properly described by Hamas frequently: Israel loves life, Hamas loves death.

If Hamas loved life, they would not behave the way that they do.  

And I wish that Hamas would not have started this war.  I wish they would not have cynically endangered their civilians.  I wish that they did not rape and murder en masse.  

What was the strategic military goal of Nova?  Of the stealing of kfir bibas?  Of taking Holocaust survivors from their kitchens and living rooms and bringing them into tunnels?

There was none.

I can tell you the military utility of placing their high level officers underneath civilians.  It's to shield these officers from attack.  Because killing civilians hurts Israel, not Hamas.

And I can tell you why other militaries don't do it.  Because they actually care about their own people.

"I don’t understand this thinking. If we objectively know that Hamas won’t stop fighting, and a deal is such a tricky process to negotiate…why couldn’t Gazans be moved somewhere *temporarily* to avoid the danger?? 

If the ultimate goal is preserving as much civilian life as possible…shouldn’t all the rhetoric just be ignored for once, and Egypt/the Muslim world be pressured to ONCE put their money where their mouth is and actually helping Palestinians…not just paying them lip service as they have for decades. I know there’s legit concerns about them not being let back into Gaza, but the far right/religious Israeli ministers who would do that…have been kept out of decision making on the war by Netanyahu for this exact reason - he knows they’re extremists, and that any kind of permanent ethnic cleansing would not be worth the severe backlash it would cause diplomatically and on the international stage. 

As far as I can tell…this obsession with not separating Palestinians from the land, is just an external all or nothing approach which continues to force Palestinians to be untouchable symbols, perpetually “resisting the occupier” instead of just for once putting their actual physical safety first.

"I agree with all of this. I think if we’re going to talk about the plight of Gazans we should be honest about the realities.

"If you don’t want to believe that Hamas did everything I’ve mentioned then you are simply ignoring what the truth is. As for Al shifa, there is a documented firefight between IDF and Hamas forces. Hamas was firing at the IDF from within the Al shifa hospitals.

I could say the exact same things about Palestinian TikTok support efforts, as many of the supposed affected victims on TikTok asking for support run on the exact same script word for word. There are leaked messages of influencers that were paid by Hamas, and some of the videos that I’ve seen on YouTube by Vox is written and supervised by a director of the PLO. 

The fact is, if you look at the evidence that proves that Hamas is, firing explosive weapons from residential buildings, an entrance to a Hamas tunnel (this is covered by both the left and right media, it’s undisputed), and they steal humanitarian aid for weapons. This isn’t Israeli propaganda, it’s just what they do. Denying this is the equivalent of me saying that all of the civilians dying is them putting their selves in harms way because I saw one video of a Palestinian father encouraging IDF soldiers to shoot his son while he is holding a Palestinian flag (this is real). It is intellectually dishonest to dismiss these very truths.

Your current view of Hamas is idealistic and is unfortunately not the truth. 

Israel has a responsibility to minimize civilian casualties as much as Hamas has a responsibility to take care of their own citizens. Hamas knows that they are going to be bombed and yet they still hide within their civilian population. The fact is, if Hamas didn’t hide within their civilian population and built military bases outside of the civilian populations, then the war would already be over.

"I’m someone who supported the oppressed Palestinian people. However, when I saw what they did on October 7, I couldn’t support them any more.

I don’t support the Israelis either because of the extreme response.  It’s completely shocking and I am disgusted by that. 

I’m amazed at people who seem to blindly support the Palestinians. They appear to just ignore the behaviour of October 7. Personally, I find people who express themselves, protest about their situation, in such a way completely abhorrent. I definitely wouldn’t want them as neighbours. Non Palestinian supporters of their cause, say their behaviour is justified. 

How can this be justified in this day and age, when there are so many other ways to protest and get your message out to the world?

I’ll say it once more — USA is the largest superpower and they are putting up a front that they are righteous to support and protect Israel like they have multiple times in the last 75 years. This produces an extremely unfair advantage to the Palestinians who have become spoils of war. Lots of propaganda have since been pushed to ensure that Arabs, Muslims, and others are dehumanized since the media is largely dictated by these superpowers and so when Israel does extremely inhumane things because they believe they have the licence to break war crimes due to October 7, it is a disproportionately unfair way to perceive the situation. If you look at all the responses against me and other pro-pali’s in this thread, the pattern is always the same : Pro-israel responses engages in oversimplification of the situation whereas pro-palestinians care about the complex nuances.

"Israel is mostly Jews, and people who claim to just be against Israel end up attacking worldwide. The Warsaw Ghetto was part of the deliberate killing of Jews because they were Jews, not because there was a Jewish military shooting rockets into Germany and blowing themselves up in public to murder Germans. Hamas is the elected government of Gaza and is therefore declaring war on Israel with every rocket and terror attack, and we know that any other country wouldn't take that lying down, and would most probably stop supplying food and water. The fact that Hamas attacks the country that supplies Gaza with food and water in the first place and doesn't get any blame for that is unbelievable enough, but when people just blame Israel for everything and not Egypt which also has a border with Gaza and when people don't criticize Hamas for digging up water pipes to turn them into rockets and not providing food or electricity despite the billions from UNWRA, and when people act like this is the most horrible conflict despite Russia bombing Ukraine and there's no outrage, and tens of millions of people displaced and facing hunger in Sudan, Yemen, and Syria and there's not a peep, Jews get suspicious.

And as everyone ignores, Israel left Gaza in 2005 which is how Hamas was elected in the first place, and for almost 20 years has just gotten rockets and terror attacks and still supplied basic necessities and let Gazans in to work, but after Oct 7 and the fact that UNWRA has decided for decades that the label of refugee is inherited by Palestinians and trapped them in that refugee mindset instead of seeking to resettle them, means that this  conflict can't be solved that easily.",r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRWtCdG9sR0dhNVhjV3lOd3dLMTlOcGxUNFdfUzNRb042Tk81bEo2UDdac2NBOUxrUC1zQ25kdDVqREltbjNTMkdzY1hHZWxabWh4UlF5ajVtMXJMX1J4cG0xQlpIYVZ0a2VRWGtTWS02b3M9

"> “Already populated” is BS.

Lol, before the 1st jewish alliyah to the lands in 1881, there were 470k arab living in the lands (in Haifa, jaffa , khalil ..etc). It was always populated with functional cities , ports and markets. 

The crusaders and ayyubid dynasty didn't fight for hundreds of years over an ""empty land"". It was always populated.

In jaffa for instance and before the 1st jewish allyah to the land (which took place in 1881), Exports of oranges grew from 200,000 oranges in 1845 to 38 million oranges by 1870.

 The citrus plantations of this time were primarily owned by wealthy Palestinian merchants and notables, rather than small farmers, as the fruits required large capital investments with no yield for several years.

 Fruits carrying the ""Jaffa"" label were first marketed in 1870 by a German Templer colony.So you are embaracing yourself with your ignorance about the region. 

> Yes, I think if they would have accepted it then less people would die and there would be peace. Being displaced 10 miles away is more humane than allowing millions to die.

Nothing justifies ethnic cleansing of 800k Palestinian from their homes. You should stop being apologetic for a tragic event where humans lost their homes.

>Hahahhahahahhahahahahbagahahahahhahhahahahahahahhahhhahaaaaaaaaa. That’s absolutely insane. Look at the population of Jews in Muslim countries over the past 1400 years. If Jews would DARE resist Islamic rule we would be exterminated immediately.

I would invite you to actually look at the numbers. Please collect all the number of death caused by Muslims on jews (specifically)... please also contrast that to the number of Muslims killed by israel in Gaza's genocide (40k) and in invasion of lebanon in the 80s by israel (19k Lebanese were killed)

You will realize that Jews have killed Muslims way more than what Muslims killed from jews in the last 1400 years. Sadly, zionism has hijacked judiasim and it is a deeply immoral radical settler ideology. Israel is now engaged in one of the worst massacres in it's history. 

> You already rejected this above and called me obsessed.

I reject racism.  You were saying that palestinans are same as Lebanese,  morrocans , Egyptians,  Jordanians..etc. (which is a very ignorant thing to say). You were trying to blame palestinans for the sins of Iraqis or Yemenis.. etc

> Believe it or not Israelis would LOVE to live beside a peaceful country of Arabs.

Israel had the chance to make peace in 1993. PLO recognized israel in 1988 and signed Oslo in 93. On the Israeli side, Rabin was assassinated.. Netenyahu took control in 1995/96 and he ""blocked a Palestinian state from happening"" as he brags about it. 

If israel is interested in peace , they should stop building settlments in west bank. Instead , they keep expanding illegal settlments and keep on annexing palestinan lands. Israel is ruled by anti-peace right wing racists who are expansionist and want more land. They want to take ""judea and samaria"". 

>  If Palestinian militant groups would not fire rockets into Israel, Israel would have zero reason to ever attack.
 
West bank is led by PLO which recognize israel and do security arrangements with israel..how does israeli government respond ? By building settlements and imposing a brutal apartheid on palestinans. 

Israeli government is the occupier , it is motivated by an expansionist radical settler ideology that see palestinans as a ""demographic threat"" to its ""jewishness"".  Thsts why good israelis must reject this and work for a shared future with paleatinans.

"Okay but that's not what you said.  You said that simply seeing images of orphaned, dead, crippled children would make anyone Pro-Palestine.

Which doesn't tell me that you used a critical eye when you saw those images.  As you said - ""it's the pictures.""  This statement, right here, is exactly why most of us are not lawyers, judges, investigators, or making military decisions - it's because people in those types of positions cannot be the type of people who go ""it's the pictures for me.""

> there's nothing being faked.

That is not what I said.   I said that it is a problem if you are allowing images to shape your opinion on something, and not stopping to ask yourself if you were being emotionally manipulated.  

For example, remember the image of the dead baby that was going around social media some weeks back?  That wasn't a fake image.  You know what was fake?  The story behind that image. A lot of people believed that the IDF blew that baby's head off, when it turns out, that wasn't true.  Do you think that's a tad manipulative?

Or, another example - the footage of orange-shirt protesters in 2005, circulating TikTok under the guise of it having anything to do with the war.

"I think that some OPs who post posts like these do provide a lot of citations. It seems possible that every fact in the OP’s post is correct. 

The problem is with the way the OP lumps all Palestinians together and ignores the kind of moderate Palestinian perspective a Zionist like me could imagine having if I were a Palestinian. 

Being a Zionist should mean keeping Israel safe, not being cruel or unjust towards the Palestinians. 

It’s hard for someone on a different wavelength to read a post like that because it’s so distasteful 

I think that Jewish Israelis deserve to be safe and happy and not to deal with insane attacks. Hateful propaganda and other forces clearly do affect how Hamas leaders are proceeding. 

But posts like the top post here are so nasty, one-sided and prejudiced that they make Israel and Zionists look bad and undermine people who just want Israelis to have the same kind of right not to be blown up or go into airraid shelters  that all of us, including Palestinians in Palestine, should have. 

Also, the arguments about Palestinian culture might be potentially relevant to how we make peace but have no bearing on the need to try to make peace.

Israel holds the power in this palestine/israel conflict. and they could make decisions to lessen the anger and hatred towards them from the palestinians and the rest of the world.

People see what israel has been doing in the west bank for decades (occupation, administrative detentions, building settlements, palestinian demolitions, allowing settler violence, restricting building - essentially pushing palestinians off their land).

I'm not going to go into the current situation in Gaza which is horrific, bc Hamas is fighting not only for the lifting the blockade from Gaza, but for the end of the occupation in the WB.

I don't support hamas or their tactics. But Israel is the super power. Literally the easiest thing they could do is stop building more settlements and make life a little easier for palestinains - stop home demolitions, make getting building permits easier for them... for a start. these are things that don't jeopardize Israeli citizen security and there's no reason for these policies, other than getting the palestinians off the land.

"Don't misrepresent me.

1. The Disengagement Plan was devised to ensure more resources could be put into controlling and settling the West Bank, and lo and behold *that's exactly what they did*. And pulling Jews out of Gaza made the place easier to bomb from above, with fewer Jewish casualties. Furthermore, the blockade of Gaza of June 2007 onwards turned it into an open-air prison, controlling food, water, electricity and everything they needed to survive. Do not pretend that the Gaza blockade didn't exist. Do not pretend Gaza was free. The brutal occupation not only continued, *it got worse*.

2. The right to return of Palestinians does not preclude the right of Jews to share the land with them, or divide it equally among themselves. The land was shared prior to 1948, albeit under British control. In future the land can be shared again.

3. Don't accuse me of supporting the massacre of Jewish children. This is a desperate and dishonest claim to make, when nothing I have said supports this.

"> Literally the easiest thing they could do is stop building more settlements

Israel hasn't built new settlements in the last 30 years (with a few exceptions, but then it also removed several settlements in 2005).

You can go to this wiki page

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Israeli_settlements

order the table by the establishment date, and see for yourself.

I am not not even talking about how Israel paid for full disengagement from Gaza.

>stop home demolitions

Demolitions where?

In WB, Israel demolishes a tiny part of illegal construction. In East Jerusalem, it's more complicated but municipal authorities can't possibly allow to build without proper permits.

>make getting building permits easier for them

To whom? Again, which territory you're talking about and what is this based on?

>Stop giving the Palestinians a reason to fight them.

Thinking that if only Israel gives out more building permits, terrorism ends is incredibly naive.

>People see what israel has been doing in the west bank for decades (occupation, administrative detentions, building settlements, palestinian demolitions, allowing settler violence, restricting building - essentially pushing palestinians off their land).

I am just curious, you do realize, do you not, that 90-95% of Palestinians in WB live in Areas A/B without any settlements, without any need to ask Israel for permits, without any demolitions, with almost full self-rule?

What you're referring to as ""pushing palestinians off their land"" concerns a few tiny villages in Area C which residents had to leave due to conflict with settlers, and several other occasions where Israel declared firing zones, etc. If that's all Israel managed to ""push off"" in 57 years of Israel's control, it doesn't appear a very successful or persistent policy.",r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaY293cXc3eHp6b2I2MFN0WmtkcC0wdWFqZVBBa3dOcWRuY0RCOVJUeVhaR1RJYlk2aTQzSExJRWh3V2RzTFYzOGRMNWhkVUg1cktxcTBoTVU3TnBxLXc9PQ==

Until that point, legally it belongs to those it was taken from and is only militarily occupied.

By relinquishing territorial claim in 1988, before peace agreements were finally made in 1994 (after decades of armistice, a separate thing), it was then land Israel had control over that was no longer actually claimed by those it was taken from. So the rules about not being allowed to lay claim to territory obtained in war were different, since Jordan said they didn't want it back.

Of course, Jordan's intention was for it to be sovereign land for a new Palestinian state. But legally that wasn't necessarily their decision to make given the circumstances. The grey area.

"**Israel started controlling access because hamas was launching rockets and trying to import heavy weapons to strike Israel.**

Israel has been controlling access for decades. Long before Hamas was created.

If Russia invaded and occupied all of the USA but left the small state of Washington to be somewhat autonomous but remained in occupation of the remaining 99% of the USA, do you think that the Americans of the only autonomous area would not fight to free the rest?

They aren't Gazans. They are Palestinians.

">If weapons were the only thing limited, I would have no problem but it goes far, far beyond that. 

Well you also have to consider that materials like concrete should be restricted since it can be used for terrorist purposes.

The occupation is caused by Palestinian violence. So rationally, attacking Israel is not going to end it. 

>https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE7041GH/- Israel told U.S. officials in 2008 it would keep Gaza's economy ""on the brink of collapse"" while avoiding a humanitarian crisis, according to U.S. diplomatic cables published by a Norwegian daily on Wednesday.

Yes it is good to keep Gaza weak, while also making sure that their humanitarian needs are taken care of.

>I am not so sure. The UK, the UN and many humanitarian groups consider Gaza to be occupied by Israel. 

Well they are wrong about this, because they don’t take into account the fact that occupation and blockade are two different things. They may know this and are just lying.

"I have read South Africa's case.

I think it would need to be clearly stated that it's Israel's policy and/or (because I acknowledge a genocidal entity might never say so) the actions- relative to capability- reflect genocidal intent.

In Gazas case, given full capability to do so with current weaponry, this would be killing without care for civilian casualties that would make it clear civilian casualties were intent and not in fact just casualties of war (*effectively, we'd need to see a death rate that mirrors the population, with no discrimination at all towards military personnel*). While the death rate is certainly high at this time, there is- even at the most sceptical of numbers- a disproportionate number of Hamas militia dead relative to civilians (*based on Hamas given numbers of 38,000 total dead and 6,000 acknowledged dead militia 5 months ago- this gives about a 15% death rate being militants even if no more have died since then, relative to militants making up approximately 1-2% of the total Gaza population, clear discrimination and focus on militants*)",r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaWFZzQkNYbW9wX2ZJbS1CVE04M2JaeFZZUi05TDVXOHdRU2RzMXY0bnFnM1MtNXdfRjI3MEZjd2JEN0huQmJxRFlXVnFmeTFOS3U1RF9US2s2VkpQbHhweERoUGVuQ0lUUjlrZmZtd1FXZUk9

">Since Palestine is the aggressor in the conflict like Russia, no one should care if they lose their homes.

Civilians should not be deliberately made to suffer for the actions of their governments unless it is absolutely essential for someone's survival. I support Ukraine and I'd support my government sending them ten times the aid it is now, but if Ukraine took back all their land, advanced into Russia and started destroying entire cities, my support would evaporate overnight and I'd demand that my government pressured them into agreeing a ceasefire. Russians should perhaps have done more to try to oppose Putin but that doesn't mean it's right for them to lose their homes until that's the last possible option to prevent Ukraine from being destroyed. Palestinians who didn't actively aid Hamas in their invasion do not deserve to suffer either, and should not lose their homes or their lives unless that is the only way Israel can possibly survive. Every single missile, bomb, rocket, artillery shell and bullet fired by Israel and Ukraine should be aimed at a known military target and if that isn't the case they should be held to account.

And yes, I'm aware that many Palestinians apparently support Hamas according to answers given to surveys, but that's happening inside people's heads. If they weren't holding prisoners or making rockets or carrying ammo then they cannot be targeted. Punishing thoughtcrimes is a straight path to fascism. Even voting for Hamas doesn't make them any more culpable than Americans or Brits who voted for Bush or Blair would be for the invasion of Iraq, and nobody calls to punish voters for that despite the horrific outcome.",r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMHR1OV9Hd2VQMk5CRmxyU3ROcEdJNlJzaUxQMWZYaG9YQjdXWnZSOHhGNVR1MmZ1TVFkd0YyLWdvMnEtWlJtMHVkUHdLeTJDSzYtRWhFZzAwNGo4bFV6RXBXd21xTXNwaFFZYUs0OENIWEU9

"i didn't say all Jews are religious, I said Judaism is a religion. 

In Judaism, there are two distinct groups ""Jews"" and ""Am Yisroel"".

""Jews"" are anyone who is obligated to keep the contract called ""the Torah"", i.e. either born to a Jewish mother or accepted upon himself to join that contractual obligation through a specific ""conversion"" process. One a person becomes a party to that contract, they cannot remove their obligation, hence ""once a Jew always a Jew"".

""Am Yisroel"" is a subset of ""Jews"" who keep a baseline part of that contract, i.e. they ""act like Jews"" in public. The specific requirements of being part of ""Am Yisroel"" as per Judaism is to keep shabbos publicly, keep the majority of relevant commandments, not practice idolatry, not murder, and believe in what's known as the ""13 principles of faith"". Without diving much deeper into where that ""red line"" sits, the point of bringing this up is that Judaism is clear that there is a ""red line"". Someone who falls outside that ""gate"" is, while still obligated to the mitzvos as a Jew, is no longer part of ""Am Yisroel"".

So, a Catholic apostate Jew would still be a Jew yet not be part of ""Am Yisroel"". Such an apostate is treated halachically as a non-Jew, in that there is no areivus, no problem of lashon hara or lifnei iver, his wine is ayin nesech, he gets no share in the next world, etc, etc.

A solid argument could be made that a jew who practices catholicism is in a better spiritual situation than a jew who practices atheism, in that they at least recognize the G-d of Abraham despite the mixture of idolatry.",r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaSVMtVnFfZG9BZVJ2MzNOY0UyODEtVWtBZ0FFTXcxd0dpMU1DQ2w4VFZ1WWFvNEp4dDRRTVVHUURCNUpCUEd3bHdwUjBKSGw3MXNmMkxKWTVNbDUxMmc9PQ==

"In Judaism, there are two distinct groups ""Jews"" and ""Am Yisroel"".

""Jews"" are anyone who is obligated to keep the contract called ""the Torah"", i.e. either born to a Jewish mother or accepted upon himself to join that contractual obligation through a specific ""conversion"" process. One a person becomes a party to that contract, they cannot remove their obligation, hence ""once a Jew always a Jew"".

""Am Yisroel"" is a subset of ""Jews"" who keep a baseline part of that contract, i.e. they ""act like Jews"" in public. The specific requirements of being part of ""Am Yisroel"" as per Judaism is to keep shabbos publicly, keep the majority of relevant commandments, not practice idolatry, not murder, and believe in what's known as the ""13 principles of faith"". Without diving much deeper into where that ""red line"" sits, the point of bringing this up is that Judaism is clear that there is a ""red line"". Someone who falls outside that ""gate"" is, while still obligated to the mitzvos as a Jew, is no longer part of ""Am Yisroel"".

So, a Catholic apostate Jew would still be a Jew yet not be part of ""Am Yisroel"". Such an apostate is treated halachically as a non-Jew, in that there is no areivus, no problem of lashon hara or lifnei iver, his wine is ayin nesech, he gets no share in the next world, etc, etc.

A solid argument could be made that a jew who practices catholicism is in a better spiritual situation than a jew who practices atheism, in that they at least recognize the G-d of Abraham despite the mixture of idolatry.",r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZ3ViX28wNTFaaUhVcWZ3SXI1ZmFWNm1hUmgzSnF1dHZmNGZLckRPeFo1LWRhazJ5WjhGRkRLWDFEWUEzMklOQ3M4ME1lMWtQVWRHYVJvVTFyYUI1d2c9PQ==

"are you kidding? have you ever learned a daf gemora?

you reminded me of this excerpt from ""The Empty Wagon"" by Rabbi Yakov Shapiro:

>Mashal: A Reform rabbi decides he wants to see what a real yeshiva is like. So one day, he walks into a large yeshiva gedolah and spends an entire day there, until the end of second seder. After the bochurim and yungeleit leave for dinner break, he goes over to the rosh yeshiva, all upset.

>“I don’t understand. Don’t your students have anything better to do all day besides talk about Reform Jews?”

>The rosh yeshiva, puzzled, asks the Reform clergyman what he is talking about, to which he replies:

>“I walked around the bais hamedrash during first seder, and the boys were learning tractate Rosh Hashanah. They were talking about a karkafta d’lo manach tefillin, someone who never donned tefillin. See? They were talking about Reform Jews! We don’t put on tefillin! And they were saying terrible things about us. Poshei Yisroel b’gufan. And then, they were busy the whole time talking about what exactly we are and how bad it is.

>“And then, during second seder, they were learning Shabbos. They have nothing else to talk about except how someone who doesn’t keep Shabbos gets skilah? And about all the petty little things someone does that makes him a mechalel Shabbos?

>“All day they’re talking about us. People who cook on Shabbos. People who carry on Shabbos. People who tie knots on Shabbos. Doesn’t a yeshiva have anything better to teach their people than railing a whole day against Reform? Is anti-Reform suddenly one of the ikrei emunah that you spend so much time on it?”

>Obviously, the purpose of learning Judaism is not, per se, in order to oppose Reform. But given that Reform opposes Judaism, if someone learns about Judaism, he is necessarily going to learn things that oppose Reform.

>It is the same with Zionism. Anti-Zionist Jews are no more anti-Zionist than they are anti-Reform. Or anti-paganism, or anti-Baal worship, or anti-atheism. Imagine if, instead of Reform and Orthodox, we would use the terms Reform and anti-Reform. That certainly would not portray an accurate picture of the relationship between Reform and the other religions. Reform is one religion, and Orthodox Judaism is another. One can believe in Reform Judaism or deny it just as one can believe any heresy; one can practice it or not. Casting the issue as Reform and anti-Reform would not properly express that.

>So, too, it does not convey an accurate picture when we refer to Zionists and “anti-Zionists.” It’s like calling Eliyahu Hanavi an “anti-Baal worshipper.” It conceals the fact that Eliyahu’s (like the rest of the “anti-Baal-worshippers”) opposition to Baal worship wasn’t a position in and of itself but rather a manifestation of his belief in Torah Judaism.

>Anti-Zionism is the same as “anti-Baal worship.” It’s just Torah Judaism, not a position in and of itself. Furthermore, it was not Judaism that came out against Zionism, but Zionism that came out against Judaism. Judaism was there first, and then Zionism was created as an ideology hostile to it. That nuance is lost when we describe the battle against Zionism as “Zionism versus anti-Zionism.”

>I am not against Zionism because I have something against Zionism per se. I am against Zionism because I am in favor of Judaism. I am a Torah-abiding Jew. It is Zionism that is against me. Zionism is against my religion. Zionism was designed to erase my religion, steal its identity, and then impersonate it.

"What you're failing to realize is that international relations, as with all things in this universe, is governed by casualty. Cause and effect. Action - reaction. The Israelis spent over five decades trying to offer the Palestinians statehood and conceding land to a new state. They helped the bourgeoning state organize, develop, and run elections. They provided them utilities because they lacked the resources and/or motivation to build them themselves (to this day, Palestine is the only State on earth to have all of its public utilities provided and paid for by another nation). Israel established the largest work visa program in the history of humanity, to provide opportunities for Palestinians to come work in Israel and earn better livings, in order to foster upward mobility... even though it came at great risk to Israel.  Ultimately, Israel offered them SIX different proposals that would have granted Palestine official statehood, the most generous of which offered Palestine 95% (!!) of the contested area. 

Despite all of this, every single offer was rejected with spite, disdain and malice, and inevitably answered with war and terrorism. Palestine spent decades attacking Israel while Israel attempted to help them and while Israel was busy granting citizenship to millions of Palestinians.  And that's not even taking into account the *absolutely brutal* ways in which the Palestinians treated the Jews prior to the establishment of the state of Israel.  

So yes, the Israeli citizens got tired of the double standards. They got tired of being told they're supposed to be ethical, responsible members of society and that they're morally obligated to help their Palestinian neighbors, while the Palestinians continue to attack them, enact constitutions fundamentally denying the right of Israelis to exist, teaching their kids that Jews are evil and should be killed, with absolutely no accountability or expectations of civility.  They got disheartened when they withdrew from Gaza in 2005, only to have the Palestinians elect Hamas the next year, and start bombing israel relentlessly... and to add insult to injury, they're told they're just supposed to ""accept"" their Gazan neighbors relentlessly launching missiles at them daily for 20 years and if they so much as suggest Israel should try to stop them, they're monsters. 

They got fed up, and they started electing leaders who would take a more nationalist stance.  This is the way ALL nations react to political leaders who don't prioritize their own citizens.  We've seen it in Britain with Brexit, the recent success of the far right in Sweden, Le Pen in France, and in the US with Trump.

"Ill be honest with you, I havent met that many Zionists in real life, most of my interactions with them happened online, so maybe I was just talking to the ""bad apples"". I cant say that I know everything there is to know about Israel, but I have educated myself quite a bit since the start of the conflict, and I have done some extensive research on both the Israeli and Palestinian narrative to get the general talking points of each side.

  
I think the problem lies in the fact that NEITHER side is ever willing to acknowledge or condemn their sides crimes. The Palestinians will usually legitimize whatever terrorism perpetuated by their side as resistance to the oppression forces, and the Israelis will defend their governments war crimes against the Palestinians & basically say something along the lines of ""Oh ItS OuR oNlY WaY tO ReMaIn SaFe"". Both sides will spread nasty lies about the other; however, since Israel is the US's biggest ally, Mainstream Western media will repeat Israeli propaganda, sometimes without even fact-checking it (like the 40 beheaded babies hoax). 

In general I have found a lot of people that spread lies regarding Oct 7 in an attempt to legitimize the terror inflicted against Gaza right now. Im not trying to deny the Oct 7 attacks & I condemn the use of violence against any civilians, but what Im not okay with is spreading lies that exacerbate it to try to dehumanize ALL Palestinians as human animals in order to justify their massacre. Maybe Iran will spread ""pro-Hamas"" propaganda, but lets be honest, who tf watches Iranian news outlets?

I also find it ironic that you complain so much about the generalization, yet will claim that Most Palestinians support the Oct 7 attacks. Only the radical Palestinians will support the death of innocent civilians on that day. Most that I've spoken with understand why Hamas did what they did, but they dont approve of their methods, especially considering the outcome of the attack. The West Bank for example doesn't have Hamas and has faced growing settler violence after Oct 7.

But you're right, this conversation is going nowhere, mostly because we have one major point that we don't agree on. I believe that BOTH sides have committed atrocities and that the occupation needs to end, and that BOTH sides need radical change for peace to occur (which I personally cant see happening any time soon). You believe that Israel is never in the wrong, and that Israel only acts in self defence. I don't believe its your problem, I believe both societies have been radicalized to hate each other. It makes sense that people hate the people that hate them, but I would say that if you truly want compromise, maybe try to objectively look at it from their perspective & try to understand why they would hate you (I'd say the same thing to a Palestinian)

"Hi 👋 

As a 3rd party reading this conversation, it does seem that your main argument is based on rhetoric and only carefully cherry-picked rhetoric taken from Israeli leadership who are clearly expressing themselves while stressed and frustrated. Comments such as Netanyahus Amalek comment is also taken out of context, and as pointed out, rhetoric doesn't equate to policy.

On strategic and tactical policy, we thankfully have an abundance of expert military analysts from across the world who generally consent that the IDF are doing more to avoid civilian casualties than any other military in history. Not only do these world leading military analysts and intelligence agencies disagree with your concept but actually praise Israel for minimizing civilian deaths in what is the most intense urban combat environment ever recorded.

Are you aware that the IDF hasn't ""bombed"" any hospitals? They have raided and cleared hospitals using ground and airborne forces to engage incombant millitants fortified inside and underneath hospitals, and significant damage has resulted, but that is quite different to ""Bombing Hospitals"".
Israel has also built 8 lage capacity field hospitals stoked with thousands of ltrs of donated blood because it was found that Hamas restricts blood supplies to civilian hospitals.

Are you aware that the current Gaza war has the lowest civilian death rate of any urban combat environment while simultaneously being recognized as the most difficult to achieve such a limitation? 

This article is written by John Spencer, who is widely regarded as the world's leading expert on urban warfare.
 https://www.newsweek.com/israel-implemented-more-measures-prevent-civilian-casualties-any-other-nation-history-opinion-1865613

Are you aware that the latest UN special report has stated that there is no evidence of an impending famine in Gaza and that there is actually 14,000 pallets (approximately 1,000 trucks worth) of food and aid that is cleared by IDF security and stockpiled while it waits for aid agencies to distribute it, and that distribution is mainly limited by Hamas piracy?

It is important on subjects such as this that we take on the statements of experts rather than random misinformation that fits our preconceptions.

"Seizing portions of enemy territory during war is not ethnic cleansing, especially when citizenship is offered to peaceful civilians on the opposing side that have been displaced. 

Whether or not Hamas is the aggressor in this case isn’t really up for debate. Whether you think that 10/7 was “justified resistance” or not does’t change the fact that they were the once’s who initiated the attack that broke the ceasefire. As for Putin, he is also objectively the aggressor. He may claim otherwise but there’s literally no way to effectively argue that he isn’t the aggressor without straight up lying. 

I don’t think that Israel can or should ethnically cleanse Gaza, nor do I think they intend to. The percentage of the Gazan population that has been killed is around 1.4% (based on the 38,000+ figure, which includes 13k Hamas militants) and the vast majority of if not all of the displacement has been internal.

">Because there are no Martians on Mars. It is empty and devoid of life. Now when the Jews came, Palestine wasn't empty. That historical myth has been debunked thousands of times. Only the eve of the Zionist arrival, there were 500 000 local Arabs according to Ottoman records

1. We are discussing about the meaning of the word colonialism in the context of 19th century writers. At those times it definitely did not mean replacing populations. It just meant “to settle”.
2. Parts of it were empty. The Jews purchased malaria-infested lands and the Negev. Ottoman records actually point at 300,000 non-jews pre-Zionism (Census of 1872), and 20,000 Jews, mostly in Jerusalem. This Ottoman census also includes Damascus because Palestine was not a distinct entity (it was under the province of Syria, referred to as ""South Syria"" btw. Only Europeans called it Palestine""). There were also a total of 250,000 Jews in the Ottoman Empire, which also had a valid claim for sovereignty from their imperialist rulers.
3. Many of those ""local"" were actually immigrants still. In 1831, an Egyptian ruler called Muhammad Ali of Egypt conquered the land of Israel and, as a result, thousands of Egyptians migrated to the area. The Ottomans built the Hegaz railway and brought over thousands of Saudis and Egyptians to work in the land of Israel. The numbers do not exist because there was no registry of movement between different parts of the Ottoman empire, but a good telltale is surnames, which in the tribal arab society usually points to place of origin. One of the most popular last names of the Arabs in Gaza and in Israel is Masri, or Masarwa, which means Egyptian. The fact those empires moved in their citizens, Arabized and force-converted the locals, does not take away from the Jewish claim one bit. 

Here is something to keep in mind:

That is also not true. The goal of Zionism was to establish a Jewish-majority country IN the land of Israel. But it does not, and it never necessitated this country to span the WHOLE of the land.

I became pro-Palestine after doing an extensive amount of academic research/readings on the history of the conflict for a class I took in college (also in New York) centered around the conflict and taught with intentional neutrality (by an incredibly intelligent and accomplished Jewish professor, I might add). I also took a handful of ethics courses which really shaped the way I analyzed conflict. Anyway, the sheer number of innocent and brutal Palestinian deaths and displacement over the decades, and a historically far right Israeli government with little remorse is ultimately what swayed me. 

Yes, obviously bias impacts most(on both sides of this conflict). It’s important to acknowledge, however, that there are those who are capable forming their opinions through the analysis of facts, putting biases aside. Your post makes it seem like this is a minority of Pro-Palestinians, but that doesn’t seem right to me. 

For your argument to have any bearing whatsoever in this context, you would need some sort of quantitative evidence to support your claim. As I am sure you’re aware given your degree, bias can be measured.

"It was a simple yes or no question. Nuance is important but it's not even what you do. Your argument fundamentally relies on a double standard that is not morally or legally defensible under international law. You assert that ""all life is precious,"" yet you justify the bombing of a humanitarian camp because a high-value target is present, dismissing the value of Palestinian civilian lives in the process. This is contradictory.

Let's address your points:

If all lives are indeed precious, then the principle must be applied uniformly. Bombing a humanitarian camp, knowing it will result in civilian casualties, cannot be justified any more than bombing an Israeli kibbutz under similar circumstances. The nationality of the civilians does not change the ethical or legal calculus.

International humanitarian law (IHL) emphasizes the principles of proportionality and necessity. The argument that a high-value target justifies significant collateral damage fails to meet these principles. ""The military advantage must significantly outweigh the harm to civilians, and every effort must be made to minimize civilian casualties."" 

Your assertion that different tools are available within Israeli territory does not negate the obligation to protect civilians. If you argue that bombing a humanitarian camp is justified due to military necessity, then, by the same logic, an attack on an Israeli civilian area with a high-value target would also be justified, which is clearly unacceptable. This double standard exposes the inherent bias in your argument.

Mohammad Deif or whoever the F, you, iof and I don't care. It's not the first massacre and excuse that has been used. Literally every week there's a new massacre at a school, hospital, refugee camps etc. I must remind you that unfortunately for you, everything that is happening there is broadcasted live. 

Blaming Hamas for hiding among civilians does not absolve the attacking force from its responsibility to protect civilian lives. Using civilian presence as a shield is a violation of IHL by Hamas, but responding with disproportionate force also violates IHL and undermines the moral high ground.

If you genuinely believe all lives are precious, you must advocate for adherence to international law uniformly, regardless of nationality. Justifying civilian casualties on one side while condemning them on the other is morally inconsistent and legally indefensible.",r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhSmVWd09hLWlfLTBodWI3UG9IYzJseXZIS0RTVkJMMmw0c0RKb3BBY0Y5VzhESi1PUUI4aGd4LVFMaEw3bURaZGVlaEJsWWcyUnhFWUlDcWt1eExsNHc9PQ==

"Ok I just want to use this logic to look at Israel ok.  
The logic is, if you say you want to do something bad, you must do the opposite.  Look at your ACTIONS.  
Right?  
""after the formation of a large army in the wake of the establishment of the state, we will abolish partition and expand to the whole of Palestine “  
You may this is a quote from Hamas, but actually  
its from Ben Gurion, p.22 “The Birth of Israel, 1987” Simha Flapan.

So using your logic, Israel would now need to display through actions that this is not its objective.  
Well since 1967 Israel has been constantly expanding into Palestine more and more expanding every single year.  In 2005 Israel gained the least Palestinian land because it gave up all of Gaza in return for a slightly larger chunk of the west bank.  Note I am only talking about land in Palestine's, not in Egypt, Syria or Lebanon.

Also I should clarify, some years they weren't able to expand, but Israel has never shrunk.  
Also last clarification by ""Israel"" I am referring to Jewish majority regions as that's what Ben Gurion meant when he said ""we"".  
  
So following this logic,   
If you believe Hamas primary objective is to destroy Israel,  
You must also accept that Israel's objective is to conquer Palestine.

Also final point is that my objective here isn't to say that Israel wants to conquer Palestine, rather that this statement is just as ridiculous as saying Hamas wants to destroy Israel.",r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhTUhJZEZnTGNMemZiZVdrZWhGUFN1bFhTMERvY0RjWmdKX0ZsVWg5S3JuTF9fS1dsQlMzTTFUREZWbmtRM21KUG1FTG5XN2J2ZGNUZjlUU0o0Ni1JaVE9PQ==

"Why is the question poised in a way to continue to deny basic human rights to Palestinians? Who is Israel to be the one to decide whether they deserve that or not? The ask is disingenuous. If it were my personal decision to make, I’d say that I’d rather die than live with no rights at all. How long does Israel expect people to live like this is the correct question. How long would Israelis be willing to live the lives they subject Palestinians to? For a people who have been forced to survive indignities at the hands of others, shouldn’t Jewish people be more sensitive to inflicting trauma like this onto others? There are lots of stories of early Holocaust survivors leaving Israel because they saw the treatment inflicted on Palestinians as equal to what they had just lived thru. 

Jihadism wasn’t a thing at the inception of Israel. Religion is a red herring. There are hundreds of thousands of Jewish people who are adamantly against what Israel has done and continues to do because the violence itself defies the Torah.

"Some western military analysts somehow defend Israel’s actions, but from human rights organizations and UN organizations its universal condemnation. Netanyahu’s preferred ICC appointee is seeking his arrest warrant for crying out loud. I am surprised how cynical places like West Point and the COFR are defending a regime that is bombing refugee camps every single day and killing dozens of civilians at a time, but then again Russia’s military scholars defend Putin’s invasion and how they’re being supposedly noble and righteous when bombing Ukrainian infrastructure. Also china’s military academics talk about the supposed need to invade Taiwan for all these disingenuous purposes. Before October 7th I thought western military institutions had a little bit more credibility, but that’s definitely not the case. HOWEVER, for as sleezy as they are, I still haven’t come across a non Israeli military analyst who thinks that militarily defeating Hamas is even possible.

It’s amazing that John Spencer is employed by West Point yet gets so much wrong. I remember being taken aback by that when I listened to his Sam Harris podcast. “Israel has taken precautionary measures even the United States did not do during its recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.” - … but they also use 2000 pound bombs in tightly packed civilian areas, and the US doesn’t use bombs larger than 500 pounds in such (https://www.cnn.com/gaza-israel-big-bombs/index.html). So they’ve sent out more ineffectual leaflets and text messages than the US did (which give unclear directions and whose evacuation paths the IDF often bombs), but the bombs they use in civilian areas are 4 times as large. And the US has an atrocious human rights record, yet even with that as the measuring stick Israel still fails horribly. 

He also says that the civilian casualty rate is comparatively low in Gaza. That’s just straight up incorrect. Even in the chief “WHAT ABOUT?” example used to divert from the Israel’s crimes - Yemen - about 11,000 children were killed from direct conflict in about a decade (https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/more-11000-children-killed-or-injured-yemen) while in Gaza the number has already surpassed 15,000 in less than a year. https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/25/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-death-toll.html 

I am surprised how thoughtful the responses I get are from people I think are defending a regime that is so obviously monstrous. Just look at the news every day. In my opinion Israel’s regime has proven beyond any reasonable doubt that they simply want to collectively punish Gaza’s population for the Hamas’s terrorist October 7th. Put that aside though. Simply follow the news, and ask yourself this:

If the IDF thinks Hamas fighters are nearby, is it okay to drop a bomb which rhetoric know will kill dozens of children in order to possibly take out those Hamas fighters? 

Anybody who responds to me has to first answer the above question. I will not answer any responses if you do not first answer my question above.",r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhS2lJbmxpOW9rSkRNUkpjNkFxUTV2Y3dtXzRJYUNhdktaVWFPNF9tc3ZlUFBlYXNNREFaQ2lqOG9aYlpRNnZTcWduSHRqSGJmcng2ZkpnbTV0QlNOSjZqN0dTSkFVcExlaXpfV2l2NjkwNnc9
"**The bottom line is participation was not just militants but ordinary gazans.**

How many? 100 ordinary folks? 200? Is that enough for you to condemn 2 million people? 

**There is huge support for hamas before and after the pogrom.**

Hamas was not all that popular before the war.

The Arab Barometer, a research network where we serve as co-principal investigators, conducted a survey in Gaza and the West Bank days before the Israel-Hamas war broke out. The findings reveal that rather than supporting Hamas, the vast majority of Gazans have been frustrated with the armed group’s ineffective governance as they endure extreme economic hardship. Most Gazans do not align themselves with Hamas’s ideology, either. Unlike Hamas, whose goal is to destroy the Israeli state, the majority of survey respondents favored a two-state solution with an independent Palestine and Israel existing side by side.

Also, Hamas only rose to win the elections because of Israel's pull out of Gaza.

They should not have left Gaza like they did. Leaving unilaterally made it look like that Hamas’s strategy of militancy was viable. If they had left after negotiations with the PA, it would look like negotiation is the way to get things done.

Leaving as they did was catastrophic and remarkably stupid. But it was also cynical, the leaders of Israel at the time were clear in their words that the pull-out of Gaza was done to buy 20 years for Israel to not make peace.

In October 2004, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's senior adviser, Dov Weisglass said *""the significance of the disengagement plan is the freezing of the peace process, and when you freeze that process, you prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state, and you prevent a discussion on the refugees, the borders and Jerusalem. Effectively, this whole package called the Palestinian state, with all that it entails, has been removed indefinitely from our agenda. And all this with authority and permission. All with a presidential blessing and the ratification of both houses of Congress. That is exactly what happened. You know, the term 'peace process' is a bundle of concepts and commitments. The peace process is the establishment of a Palestinian state with all the security risks that entails. The peace process is the evacuation of settlements, it's the return of refugees, it's the partition of Jerusalem. And all that has now been frozen.... what I effectively agreed to with the Americans was that part of the settlements would not be dealt with at all, and the rest will not be dealt with until the Palestinians turn into Finns. That is the significance of what we did.""*

Sharon's Deputy leader and future Israeli PM, Ehud Olmert said *""we may have to espouse unilateral separation... \\[it\\] would inevitably preclude a dialogue with the Palestinians for at least 25 years.""*

The perception among Palestinians is that Hamas is the only group willing to do anything. That's why they are popular when they actually do something.

"> that is bombing refugee camps every single day and killing dozens of civilians at a time

'dozens' is really not many deaths in a war. As for 'refugee camps', that's a very manipulative way to put it. 'Parts of a city' is far more accurate, yet doesn't have the dramatic flair you're after.

When you start a seemingly well-meaning and high-effort comment with this sort of manipulative language, it doesn't bode well.

> Russia’s military scholars

> Also china’s military academics

I don't care about who is defending what, I care about the substance of their argument. It appears that you have latched onto the 'oppressor / oppressed' narrative, and given that Palestine, matches 'oppressed' for you, Israel is the oppressor. Following that, Palestine is forgiven for any transgression, and Israel is held to an impossibly high standard.

Honestly, if you're complaining about 'dozens' of innocents dying in a strike when the foe is using human shields, perhaps you should take issue with the strategy of embedding in a city to begin with. That you're failing to do that indicates severe bias.

>  “Israel has taken precautionary measures even the United States did not do during its recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.” - … but they also use 2000 pound bombs in tightly packed civilian areas, and the US doesn’t use bombs larger than 500 pounds in such

Okay? He did not claim that they do everything better than the US. Just that they take some precautionary measures that the US does not, which is certainly impressive.

>  So they’ve sent out more ineffectual leaflets and text messages than the US did (which give unclear directions 

How are they unclear?

> and whose evacuation paths the IDF often bombs)

'Often bombs'. Like when?

> He also says that the civilian casualty rate is comparatively low in Gaza. 

It's incredibly low given the circumstances.

> Just look at the news every day. 

This is an incredibly vague request. There is enough choice of news out there to paint any picture you want, and I think explains a lot about your conviction and stance.

> In my opinion Israel’s regime has proven beyond any reasonable doubt that they simply want to collectively punish Gaza’s population for the Hamas’s terrorist October 7th.

Well, if Hamas released the hostages and surrendered, maybe we'd find out? Until they do, there's obviously a good reason to continue this war. That you're speculating about 'collective punishment', when there's a clear reason to wage war seems highly biased.

Like, if Hamas didn't take hostages, and surrendered on day 1, and Israel decided to keep on bombing, I'd agree with you. As it is, Hamas needs removing, and that process is *never* going to be pretty.

You're arguing from a fantastical point of view where Israel can somehow wage war against Hamas while not causing collateral damage - something infinitely harder when Hamas is trying to get their own civilians killed, rather than protect them.

> If the IDF thinks Hamas fighters are nearby, is it okay to drop a bomb which rhetoric know will kill dozens of children in order to possibly take out those Hamas fighters?

Depends on the military value of the fighters. Each strike is calculated on a case-by-case basis.

If Sinwar decides to surround himself with 50 Palestinian children, and the IDF bomb him, then you should be blaming Sinwar for that.

Let's see.
> If all lives are indeed precious, then the principle must be applied uniformly.
While the principle must be applied uniformly, it is a fact of life that ""precious"" doesn't mean ""having the same value"". What is precious for me may be worthless for you and vice versa. If you were right, then in every negotiation up to now Hamas should stand firm upon a 1:1 trade ratio. And yet, they demanded 1000 of their soldiers for a single Israeli soldier. Apparently, ""precious"" is subjective to Hamas. 
Furthermore, it is simple human nature that keeping kin alive is more important than keeping the lives of those who attack kin.

> International humanitarian law (IHL) emphasizes the principles of proportionality and necessity.
Agreed.

Hardly. The contrary is quite the case.
>  ""The military advantage must significantly outweigh the harm to civilians, and every effort must be made to minimize civilian casualties.""
The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not considered war crimes. Why? Because they led Japan to decide not to further pursue war, which would have led the Allies to invade the home islands, with the associated loss of life that would be significantly bigger than the two atom bombs.
Likewise, Israel went after two military leaders and their associated retinue. Both had been responsible for the ongoing commanding of the war from Hamas side. If you every heard the term ""decapitation"" as a strategy, it is quite well regarded as a conflict shortener, as it tends to throw the enemy into disarray. At this time, anything that shortens the war is not only justified, but also of the interest of the Gazans (if not their leadership). 
> Your assertion that different tools are available within Israeli territory does not negate the obligation to protect civilians
No, it does not, but it cuts short the array of means Israel has at its disposal to pursue the war. Since we have already established that the purpose of the war from the Israeli side is to protect Israelis from Hamas, that takes precedence over the collateral damage inflicted due to the decision, by Hamas leadership, to put themselves in the middle of a humanitarian zone. Given the means, the motive, and the opportunity, versus the military gain of decapitating the opposite force, the powers that be in the IDF and the government of Israel decided it was a valid military operation and moved forward. You are not equipped to or requested of to make a different evaluation. 
>  If you argue that bombing a humanitarian camp is justified due to military necessity
No. The bombing of a military target is justified by military necessity. The target, having chosen to embed itself in a humanitarian camp, removed the protections of said camp given to it by the   laws of war. It is quite clear to anyone who understands the realities of war.
>  by the same logic, an attack on an Israeli civilian area with a high-value target would also be justified
Agreed. A pinpoint attack with the correct means to minimize collateral damage at an Israeli strategic target embedded into the Israeli civilian population would be justified by the laws of war. But Hamas doesn't do pinpoint attacks, they do carpet rocketing. So we may never know.
> This double standard exposes the inherent bias in your argument.
There is no double standard. In both cases an attack would be justified. 
> Blaming Hamas for hiding among civilians does not absolve the attacking force from its responsibility to protect civilian lives. 
No, it does not. It only brings out the reality of how Israel choses the correct tool for the correct occasion. For example, rather than 90 Hamas soldiers and civilians that died with their commander, it could have been 900 if Israel adopted the Russian approach of scorched earth. Israel would not be wondering if Deif is dead or not, because there would haven't been a stone left unturned in that area. Instead, as the pictures clearly show (you know, everything is broadcast now!) it is easy to see it was a very limited attack. And that is Israel exercising its responsibility to protect civilian lives.

To us (sane people) - “Zionist” simply means someone who believes that the state of Israel has a right to exist.  I’ve never been to Israel, have no plans to ever go to Israel.   In fact, my family is Muslim.  Yet, I’m a sane person - which makes me a Zionist.  

No one cares about your “academic” arguments anymore regarding the word itself.  Because to us, sane Zionists, being “anti-Zionist” demonstrates either antisemitism, ignorance, or weird delusions about how the world works (or all three).  

You, of course, have every right to criticize Israel in good faith.  In which case, you need better words.  Something along the lines of “as a critic of Israel’s policies, I would like to point out”…. would work just fine. 

That’s it.  That’s all you need to do.  And then we can all see that we’re dealing with a sane, thoughtful person and would be willing to engage in a good-faith argument.

"1. Palwatch is not a source, it's an organisation that has a mission. Regardless how biased it is it can't be counted as a source as the information put forward there (13 witnesses out of estimated 700.000) has not been put into a context by a historian. 
2. The first source is lists nr. 1 as a source, I can't see in which way the second listing is used. I don't see an author for the article as well. The quotes often point to some promises of Arab leaders after people started fleeing, that the Arab leaders promised that everything would be good again. Well leaders make false promises in the Arab world, just as they do everywhere else. The second source does not say that the fighting and clearing of villages started before the mandate ended and it blames the Arabs for not accepting the partition (which nobody would accept).
3. The IDF claims something. These aren't unbiased sources that you use. But you can check the list of factors that it lists for the migration, nr. 1 is the hostility of the Israeli armies.
4.True, and sadly not many historians who have written about it and dare I say none of them unbiased.
5. True, everything is a combination of a few factors. But warfare and killing civilians is the main factor of them leaving. There hasn't been a leader in history that has had the power to tell 700.000 people just to leave without using force to so. Very few people leave their homes for somebody else.

But I agree with you in general, this history does not change that Israel exists and has a right to exist. All this discussion has no effect on what's happening in Gaza or the West Bank. I've never in history seen people use something that happened 75 years before as a justification for warfare, the way that the treatment of Palestinians is justified with some non acceptance of partition plan 75 years ago is just idiotic.

The numbers are completely unreliable, but it's safe to assume that the real numbers and therefore the ratio on the ground is lower. Hamas numbers are bound to be exaggerated, and I'd expect many more combatants among the dead, either trapped undeground, or in civilian clothes.

Really, you're asking me to demonstrate the existence Professional Class Progressive monoculture, which most people have already observed just by being in society and interacting with Progressives.

And a core part of that monculture is an inability to admit its existence, like you're doing.  Progressive culture (which I grew up in) has a desperate, neurotic need to feel that we're on the ""right side of history"", and the IDEA of the Academic, the IDEA of the Activist, these sorts of things are sacred concepts.  By following the Academic or the Activist, the Progressive feels confidence that they are doing the right thing and their worry about not being ""one of the good ones"" is alleviated.

The result is a subculture that is functionally authoritarian and incapable of self-criticism.  And guess what, this is a big reason why Trump is so popular.  The left actually has very serious self-reinforcing cultural problems.  Its Israel discourse is but a symptom.",r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNncFFhcXlsWTR1VzBFVGwzUWhNREw5eHk5aWFiQmlRb3dsZG80amZwQ09tZndaTnMwLXR0aUNra1k1WTJldGZfOEFaVTVoTHRYQWl5MF9SS242dlk0N0E9PQ==

"Perfect, this is the kind of comment that helps so much... you say early zionist, but the early zionists didn't say anything like that.  I know you're correct though, if we talk about *later* zionists like jabotinsky. 

Early zionists were people like Josef Vitkin and Asher Ginsberg who were alllllllll about coexistence.  

If you explore the writings of early zionists, it was all about peace and being ethical.  It was only after they were getting attacked all over the world that you start to see people like jabotinsky with a militant philosophy.  And that's understandable.  

You should also know that ""colony"" didn't have negative connotations back then. You're thinking like a modern person if you assume colony = bad. The land belonged to the Ottoman empire and then to the British empire.  It didn't belong to indigenous arabs any more than it belonged to indigenous jews.  So the idea of a ""colony"" want not about taking over someone's land.  

There was a LOT of land.  16 million people live there today, and only 1.5 million people lived there in 1948. Think about that. It really was possible to make  a majority jewish state (so they would be safe and people would not klll them) without popultation transfer.  

It would be bad if they went and took land away from the arabs and moved them from their homes, but that is not what early zionists did at all.

One can take it as face value and say they really do fear that it could lead to retaliatory measure.. or cynically claim that they have something to hide. Or it could just be that both Israel and Egypt somehow benefit from the media blackout.

"> You used the extreme example deliberately because it diverts from that fact that in reality most of the bombings that Israel does which cause mass civilian casualties are not targeting sinwar or his lieutenants.

No, I used the extreme example to illustrate a higher level of collateral that might be considered acceptable. Kindly don't make malicious assumptions.

As I have said multiple times, acceptable collateral scales with the value of the target, I provided you a vague upper bound from my personal point of view. If you want a lower bound from my point of view, I'd say that for a low level foot soldier of no strategic importance, a 1:1 collateral ratio is already questionable. However under the circumstances where Hamas is so thoroughly embedded, that may be necessary, and I get the impression that's approximately what the IDF is working with.

> Also with that October 31st attack the Israeli military didn’t even claim that there were military targets nearby, at least not that I’ve seen, and they even have a history of lying about such things.

So you're casting doubt on any response before they even give it? If you don't trust anything they say, there's no point in even checking their responses, is there?

As I said, I think the strike should be investigated. What more do you want?

Okay? If you can't maintain civil conversation, that's on you.

Very sensible. And you might even find that having a civil conversation about a topic where you disagree with someone provides you an alternative to a violent solution. We would both like that, right? Or do you feel that if you disagree with someone, aggression is the answer?

> It’s pointless anyways because moral axioms aren’t even factual disagreements.

We can base our discussion in fact. You seem to be trying to work with evidence to support your opinion, but as I've said, the evidence is pretty poor, in this case. Yet there's enough evidence to warrant further investigation. Isn't that a reasonable stance?

> Also John Spencer’s article pretty much was about Israel being better than the US at urban warfare when it comes to avoiding civilian casualties

I'd generally agree with him on that, but I'm open to changing my mind. I think the US military likely has less people with a 'vengeance' mindset in recent conflicts, but Israel is facing a more embedded and self-destructive foe than the US has.

> and bombing evacuation paths being another

I've not seen evidence of that. I've seen claims, but as usual, they seem based on very frail evidence. Currently it seems that you're repeating a rumour, but I'd be keen to understand better what you're on about.

Let's entertain this notion for a moment. Do you think it was a deliberate move by the IDF to bomb an evacuation route? A mistake? A rogue serviceman? What would be the point? Aren't there better targets if someone wanted to cause as many casualties as possible?

> Also, 2/3 of the Gazans listed as dead by the MoH have already been FULLY IDENTIFIED

It's not so much the amount killed that is in question, but the number that are combatants. Stil, the numbers don't line up. [Here you go.](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/how-gaza-health-ministry-fakes-casualty-numbers)

Ultimately when we face a government like Hamas that is quite keen on the idea of getting their own civilians killed, we fundamentally have a huge problem.

"History is more complicated than ""Israel is an occupying power"". For instance, the myth that there was peace between Arabs and Jews in Palestine is just that - a myth. Or that the Jews are the aggressors, or that the Arabs accepted the Jews while they ethnicly cleansed Arabs from their homeland.  The truth is, historically, Arabs attacked Jewish communities and villages, and then the Jews retaliated. The Arab attack on Tel Hai in 1920 was the first military engagement between Jews and Arabs, ending in the destruction of the Jewish settlement. This was the case during the 1920 Nebi Musa riots, the 1921 Jaffa riots, the 1929 Palestine riots, and the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, among others. The Jewish communities in Hebron, Nablus, Gaza, Tulkarem,  and Jenin were destroyed in 1929 alone, way before the Nakba. Only in the 1947-1948 civil war, during the seige of Jerusalem by the Arabs, did Israel start evacuating Arabs from their homes. 

As to your claim, that the Zionist Jews are occupiers - Jews are, in all intents and purposes meaning, indigenous to the land of Israel. There has always been a Jewish presence in Israel, and Israel has always been the Jewish homeland. Even before the Zionist movement, Jews came to Israel to build communities and towns.

-the terrorism did not come after the ""oppression"", it started when there was no oppression pre-1948 and continued in 1948-1967 without any occupation and was essentially never-ending regardless of the material conditions on the ground.",r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnY3JDWVNqY2dIcDdDSkhFaklWZTdBWEgwb2diMDd2QmlBa3lyUHl0VFM4TG00ZjVaeXR4RTJuc2diMjJJcV9Xd3hHb0xwaElselp3d1BHbVR1UzIxTmJCb04tUC1HbVFWVk5vMmZEN0ZCVG89

"In order to accept the premise of this question you have to accept that all the people who are intent on returning back to their ancestral homelands or intent on living with freedom in their homeland are terrorists. The parallels between WWII axis powers have multiple incongruences. Both Japan and Germany to this day are largely mono cultural, especially Japan. Had the allies decided to colonise Japan and force them to be second class citizens then I’m in no doubt there would still be kamikazes and katanas flying. The brutality of the French in Algeria and the white South Africans did not meet their objectives because colonialism is unsustainable as a permanent solution without complete eradication of the native population, see Australia.

">It's not pointless. Jews have been the victims of ethnic cleansing, so it's really disgusting when hateful people spin it around and say Jews perpetrate ethnic cleansing. 

This doesn't really make sense - there's nothing about a particular ethnicity suffering in a particular way that then prevents people of that ethnicity inflicting the same type of suffering in future. Jewish people were forced out of numerous countries, and Jewish communities also fled from some without being specifically forced out but because they had good reason to fear for their safety. This was ethnic cleansing in both cases. The founders of Israel perpetrated ethnic cleansing during the Nakba.

>And 20% of israelis are Arab. So there is not ethnic cleansing.

Common misconception - neither ethnic cleansing nor genocide have to be total to meet the commonly accepted definitions. They have to be a concerted effort to kill or expel people based on ethnicity, and Israel did make a concerted effort to expel people based on ethnicity during the 1948 war. Refugees fleeing in war is common and wouldn't count as ethnic cleansing on its own of course, but those refugees having legitimate reason to fear for their safety because of the advancing armies destroying Arab villages and in some cases committing massacres, and later being prevented from returning based on their ethnicity does make it ethnic cleansing.",r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnRVMzU21kS2VHOHRGNlV0cWl0SnpoVEhiUmFYWVVNaU5LOU5lMmtsX0k2TUFMRHhsYmxPT25DZ0wyeUlhcGhkNkhpcU1hZ1lLTHpLNlZnWUxpc3hueFQ0azBDUUdlMUw0WVZfYWQtQi1VT1U9

"A large portion of the Arabs that left Israel left at the command of Arab military leaders, who ensured them they would be able to return soon, after the Jews were defeated. That didn't play out all that well for them.

Many also left because of exaggerated fear propaganda made by the Arabs, displayed in print and played on radio. They took real events like Deir Yassin, invented things that didn't happen, lied about the numbers of dead and injured, and otherwise exaggerated the events. When Arabs fled as a result of this, that certainly wasn't Israel doing ethnic cleansing. My understanding is that Deir Yassin massacre happened because the Arabs in that city had broken their peace agreement with the Jews, but I've only heard that second hand from someone who allegedly had it from a book by historian Benny Morris.

"> why do **some* pro-Palestine people continue to deny the gang rape and sexual abuse perpetrated by Hamas on October 7th despite the evidence? Why is it dismissed as ""Israeli propaganda."" when it’s not propaganda?

Essentially the problem was:

1.  Israel did not conduct a forensic investigation.  They allowed a very amateur team to destroy the evidence.  Then used their analysis.  Unquestionably those people made false conclusions and also lied.  The mood in Israel in October was one that encouraged exaggeration.  That started a lot of things off on a bad foot.  

2.  Israel systematically lied about many aspects of the attack.  Generally, the Western standard is if you tell the truth 85% of the time everything you say gets dismissed and there needs to be outside evaluation. I think Israelis fail to understand how damaging having their government sometimes lying is to their standing.  They should be holding their leadership to much higher standards than they are. 

3.  Hamas has a long history of being quite anti-rape.  You'll notice there isn't remotely the same level of disbelief about Hamas deliberately shooting children.  

4. The consequences from their perspective are unbalanced.  Israel was using their anger about the attacks to justify widespread war-crimes (and to most of the critics outright genocide).  Their feeling was this wasn't a balanced discussion it was one where the consequences of being wrong in one direction were quite a bit worse than the consequences in the other. Remember the context here is a government whipping up their population to the point they are razing cities in response. 

5.  There is some question about to what extent Nova was Hamas vs. a riot.  That is ""systematic rapes"" has two elements.  Many are willing to agree rapes likely occurred but have trouble with systematic.  There is an extreme lack of evidence regarding systematic.  

6. Hamas themselves has been fairly frank about their entire plan sort of falling apart because they encountered much less resistance than they expected.  For example Hamas has stated they had mostly wanted soldier hostages but a lot of the freelancers grabbed old people and children, requiring much higher levels of care and creating greater outrage.  The negotiations demonstrate that Hamas had wanted those hostages released and they did so.  

> yet people are still in denial and continue to demand for proof, even though there has been much evidence already.

There hasn't been a ton of evidence.  For example we don't have a ton of hostages giving interviews by name saying they were raped in captivity.  If there are witnesses coming forward, who are they?  We have had a few people who say they witnessed rapes but elements of their story have been disproven.  We have a lot of 3rd hand sources.",r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnTkdxaGNlQ1FueW53X0NXLWR4MFhWNnMwYXRKcklUaHJMaXFPd2F3aElITEVqaFlkWDFnWjk4TXdtQ2tvMGJmYzFRMW9PR2hjTE91ekswUlowTWFCMlE9PQ==
