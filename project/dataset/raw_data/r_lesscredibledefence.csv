"People ranting about ""middle income traps"" are clearly delusional.

China doesn't need to care about the so-called ""middle income trap"" because it didn't fall for the Western neoliberal ladder-kicking bullshit. They retained state capitalism policies, a local manufacturing industry while gradually expanding into services, unlike the other developing countries who relied on a shitty services economy or raw resource extraction.

https://eh.net/book_reviews/kicking-away-the-ladder-development-strategy-in-historical-perspective/

>Chang highlights the paradox that many of today’s high income countries did not pursue such policies when they were climbing the economic ladder of success in the nineteenth century. Rather, these countries implemented high tariffs and sectoral industrial policies, lagged in the introduction of democratic reforms, stole industrial technologies from one another, did not have independent central banks, and so forth. Therefore, in Chang’s view, developed countries are hypocritical when they seek to deny developing countries access to these same policy tools and when they urge them to adopt democratic reforms and protect intellectual property.

China is already upper-middle income, with a per capita income slightly lower than the threshold determined by the WTO for high income economies. If it was really so important, inflating China's currency value would easily propel China into high income.

">Except you haven’t looked into how much energy a Mk 72 booster imparts on the surface launched missile at separation.

Please explain how it would ""impart"" more energy then being launched from an altitude of 30,000 - 40,000 ft. The Mk 72 booster is required because it is being launched from the ground, regardless the energy it ""imparts"" is no where close to as significant as being launched from a high altitude, unless of course you have no clue why that is important.

So no, I haven't forgotten to look into it, you have.

>This is not the booster on a Harpoon

It is irrelevant what type of booster it is, I gave you a perfect example of how range is affected when launched from the air vs the ground.

I.e. the Harpoon also uses a booster when launched from the ground, it doesn't when launched from the air and yet the range is doubled when launched from the air, meaning the booster doesn't impart even close to the same energy required to perform similar to simply being launched at a much higher altitude by a jet going supersonic.

>And for some reason you seem to think that a Hornet laden with drop tanks and AIM-174s would be meaningfully faster than mach 1 for some reason, which is just laughable.

Hahaha and for some reason you think the F-18s would be ""laden"" with AIM-174s.... But yes the F-18 can accel to easily reach Mach 1.15 - 1.3.

>So going by what we know (and at least senior high school level physics), that is not the case.

The F16 has data it can send to these missiles that the Mig can't by default anyway. The F-16 can launch AGM-88 HARM missiles in Pre-Briefed and Target of Opportunity modes without HTS pods. The info given by the flight systems before launch is important to it's ability to actually find and hit the target.

**On balance, there are more reasons to believe that since December 2016, there is no legal basis to continue to treat China as an NME.**

There is no ""proof"" of NME or requirement to disprove NME. Only China is uniquely discriminated in this way, and China rightfully objected in the WTO. Instead of fighting it in court though, US decided to kill the court entirely.

On the other hand, it's also obviously against Japan's interest to further strengthen the dollar through purchase of the dollar currency and sending money flows to the US.

"Google Godfree Roberts, we can talk about what Mao *did do*...

>China's growth in life expectancy at birth from 35–40 years in 1949 to 65.5 years in 1980 is among the most rapid sustained increases in documented global history

* [*An exploration of China's mortality decline under Mao: A provincial analysis, 1950–80*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4331212) 

&#x200B;

>“The simple facts of Mao’s career seem incredible: in a vast land of 400 million people, at age 28, with a dozen others, to found a party and in the next fifty years to win power, organize, and remold the people and reshape the land–history records no greater achievement. Alexander, Caesar, Charlemagne, all the kings of Europe, Napoleon, Bismarck, Lenin–no predecessor can equal Mao Tse-tung’s scope of accomplishment, for no other country was ever so ancient and so big as China. Indeed Mao’s achievement is almost beyond our comprehension.”

* *John King Fairbank: The United States and China*

Despite a brutal US blockade on food, finance and technology, and without incurring debt, Mao grew China’s economy by an average of 7.3% annually, compared to America’s postwar boom years’ 3.7% . When Mao died, China was manufacturing jet planes, heavy tractors, ocean-going ships, nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles.

As economist Y. Y. Kueh observed: “This sharp rise in industry’s share of China’s national income is a rare historical phenomenon. For example, during the first four or five decades of their drive to modern industrialization, the industrial share rose by only 11 percent in Britain (1801-41) and 22 percent in Japan”.

**To put it briefly Mao:**

* Doubled China’s population from 542 million to 956 million,
* Doubled life expectancy from 35 years to 70 years
* Gave everyone free healthcare
* Gave everyone free education
* Doubled caloric intake
* Quintupled GDP
* Quadrupled literacy
* Liberated women
* Increased grain production by 300%
* Increased gross industrial output x40
* Increased heavy industry x90
* Increased rail lineage 266%
* Increased passenger train traffic from 102,970,000 passengers to 814,910,000
* Increased rail freight tonnage 2000%, increased the road network 1000%
* Increased steel production from zero to thirty-five MMT/year
* Increased industry’s contribution to China’s net material product from 23% to 54% percent.",r/lesscredibledefence,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYOGplTjl0YVhtcFM2WU9RUFNsWmt4MW13OHk2ZXExS2JjMllac19ESzF6QmtyYlY4NmlHZy1vMk5Qb3oyVlNhZWtod3lvVUJtRVdmVHYtYjJlYXA4bVE9PQ==
">  ""Pivot to Asia"" in 2011

During 2011 and the few years after it, the policy was touted as the work of Hillary Clinton, just to be fair. And, there was always a undertone of it leads to some sort of hot war against China. The policy shift was also known as ""America's Pacific Century"" and the policy quietly went away as Clinton went out of office.

US is an Europe-centric country due to culture. There is nothing the government can do to actually pivot to Asia. Anything you read in the media was solely window-dressing. And, the hilarious ""Indo-Pacific"" policy was even a half assed propaganda effort, nothing of substance.

"The American right-wing conservative think tank ""Heritage Foundation"" formulated the ""2025 Plan"" (many of the authors are members of Trump's team), which is regarded by the outside world as Trump's blueprint for governing in the next term. Although the Trump Republican Party did not officially endorse it, the Democratic Party denounced it as ""clearly Trump's governing style.""

Plan 2025 chief Kevin Roberts said he was aware that Trump lied about not knowing about Plan 2025.

The main points are:

1. crack down on foreign immigration and allow the military to enforce the law domestically.

2. crack down on LGBTQ.

3. ban abortion for women.

4, Deny global warming, ban scientists from studying the subject, and strongly support oil and gas production.

5, Fight pornography and criminalize adult pornography.

6, Increase the death penalty and fight black on white racism.

7, Ban the rise of the Mexican state.

8, China's 5,000 year tradition makes it impossible for it to be peacefully transformed. The U.S. should make every effort to incite Chinese threat/conspiracy theories, crack down on pro-Chinese people, get the U.S. military to fight China's ""One Belt, One Road"", and call on the whole of the Americas to unite against China.

9. Make every effort to fight anti-Americanism in Latin American countries.

10. Make an effort to subvert the Iranian government.

11. Give full support to Israel and sanction Palestine.

12, Crack down on China and Russia's operations in African countries.

13. The U.S. must revert to viewing international organizations as tools for promoting U.S. interests and abandon all international organizations that do not serve the U.S.",r/lesscredibledefence,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZQkRvalZLZUhWcWU1OWRmX3ZWMXozTmN4c1VkMUZvTUotUGpTQ1JrQUN2MEtlOXNVeGpCc3BZaGRjWS1rVG5CaXFxMlZCRV9zd09VN2w4TkREWm1BMFE9PQ==

"> You want a citation that China abided by conditions set by the WTO prior to joining? China is in the WTO right now, lol.

Oh, right. Because China is in the WTO, that must mean it is obeying absolutely every condition, and is actively pursuing the best of humanity, and not helping / looking the other way as people supply those actively waging wars all over despite must of the world suggesting that maybe they should do something about that. Anything's justified if it harms the US or advances Chinese interests.

After all, China is a saintly country where something like ""lying"" simply isn't in anyone's vocabulary... Lest they lose some all important face.

(This was sarcasm, in case you weren't able to follow)

> On balance, there are more reasons to believe that since December 2016, there is no legal basis to continue to treat China as an NME.

That links to a person that wrote an opinion piece agrees with you. You can express your opinion without going, ""and see, this other person who stands to benefit from it agrees.""

Obviously on the balance there is *actually* enough to convince the world community that China is an NME, given that it remains one. It's quite simple as that. If it wasn't, then the greed of the rest of the world would quickly normalize trade. Given that this hasn't happened, something even more powerful than greed is keeping the world extremely wary. (Well, many somethings. If you follow China then roughly once a week it does things that make it obvious it can't be trusted, from military drills around places they have no business being, to sending weapons and weapon parts to places that they no business sending to, to overlooking obvious smuggling, to IP theft, to unlawful seizure of assets, and the list goes on)

The fact that you can link to a blog, written by a trade lawyer, that says he thinks that China shouldn't be labelled NME because one interpretation of an agreement can be viewed to suggest that it should no longer be one, if you ignore some inconvenient parts of it, and pretend that satisfying most conditions is kinda like satisfying all of them.

After all, we decide things ""on the balance"" right? It wouldn't be right to punish someone for doing most of the things, and not doing the one thing they really, really didn't want to do, right? Never mind that this one thing they didn't want to do is explicitly the reason from this agreement in the first place.

> There is no ""proof"" of NME or requirement to disprove NME. Only China is uniquely discriminated in this way, and China rightfully objected in the WTO.

Ah yes, poor China. The world just won't let it dump the result of intense government sponsored manufacturing onto the world market without charging them more tarrifs. Obviously the only victim here is China. If only the rest of the world would stop trying to keep it's own manufacturing and rely entirely on China.

It's so unfair that the world's biggest NME is treated as an NME. It would be so much more fair if it wasn't treated that way, but could remain that way. 
 
Buddy. Lol.

> Instead of fighting it in court though, US decided to kill the court entirely.

Yep, we already agree that the US sucks and also needs to be brought down a peg. Fortunately the US is falling apart on it's own, and yet there still doesn't seem to be much appetite outside of China to remove the label.

Almost like words mean something, and 

> Except in the WTO, and all the other times China abided by the rules

And when, praytell, was that? I guess ""absolutely always, with no exceptions, obviously"" according to you

Yet for some reason, most of the rest of the world keeps treating it like it's constantly trying to skirt the rules, and attempting to play the ""you said this, therefore you must do it"" play.

I wonder if we could find a comparison for other countries in similar positions which went differently. Ah, right. The real China. Seems Taiwan isn't having any trouble with handling any of these issues. Almost like if Chinese people actually try to be part of the world community, instead of trying to constantly find every humanly possible way to maximize the control of the party at the expense of all else, the world might treat it differently.

Or hell, why even go that far. How about literally every single Chinese person living outside of China. You know, the hard working, dedicated, persevering people that do really, really well when removed from a communist environment? The same ones that turn around treat China more strictly than basically any non-asian person.

> China hasn't followed the rules at all! Delusional bootlick ignores all contrary evidence and insists on his false reality. 

The guy that literally can't take the CCP's dick out of his mouth is complaining about bootlicking? 

> You've offered not a single citation or source to back up your entire post full of nonsensical ramblings, buddy.

"Ah yes, countries have the right to start massive wars at will because “its the truth of how the world works.” How very profound and thoughtful. I really wasn’t aware that powerful countries have started wars before so thank you for highlighting that. By the way, does this logic apply to people committing crimes like murder, just because they can? If I stated that people do not have the right to murder each other, would you argue that people do have the right to murder each other, based on the same reasoning you use here to justify the right to start wars? I mean hey, wars and murder both violate laws and both come with severe consequences. Just like how you point out that powerful countries have the ability to start wars for their own interests, people often have the ability to murder other people for their own interest. Just like how you point out that wars happen and its just the way the world works, murder sometimes happens too ajd thats just the way the world works, right? The same logic you use to defend the right to start wars applies to murder as well, so can you reconcile this? 

Obviously my point here is that you arguing that any countries have the right to start massive wars simply because they have the ability to is about as thought-provoking as someone arguing that they have the *right* to commit crime because they have the ability to do so. If someone was on trial for committing a crime, and made this same argument you’re making to defend war, they might be sparred jail time and sent to a psychiatric ward instead because that is insane nonsense. 

Rights are not simply determined by ability. When I say people don’t have the right to murder each other, I’m not questioning whether they have the ability to do that or if murder happens sometimes. Similarly, when I say a country doesn’t have the right to start a war, I’m not questioning their ability to start a war, or whether wars happen sometimes. So, you simply pointing out these countries’ histories and ability to start wars is non-responsive to my point and you should do better. Nobody has the right to murder, and no country has some right to start a war and potentially kill millions. It’s insane to suggest otherwise.

"To wage a war, rights, ability, and willingness are all indispensable.

These three are different. What most countries lack is not rights, but ability. Not just the ability to start a war, but the ability to end it.

Currently, the only country that possesses all three is the United States, which has participated in the most wars.

China obviously lacks the will because we have not fought a war in more than 40 years. This is also where Westerners especially like to laugh at us, thinking that China is a paper tiger with no war experience.

It has been so long that some people have forgotten that we have the right and ability to go to war and are trying to dictate China's internal affairs.

Don't simply compare war with criminal crimes such as murder and robbery, because criminal crimes have violent institutions that can punish criminals, such as the police, courts, prisons, etc.

But war is different. There is no violent institution that can punish a country. There is even no institution that can define whether a war is just or not, unless authorized by the United Nations Security Council. However, there are 5 exceptions in the Security Council, and 2 of them have already destroyed this mechanism, the United States and Russia.

This is the political reality. If you are keen on criticizing the injustice of war, I have no objection, please continue!

But I don't think that would help avoid war.

Only by recognizing the coldness of reality and the cruelty of war and being in awe can we avoid war and save lives!That's what China is doing in the South China Sea, we are following the wisdom of our ancestors from 2500 years ago - to be cautious of war, and they should feel lucky that a country that is the second most powerful in the world is only complaining.

Pornography gets some flak in the (very emotional) Foreword, but there are only two mentions of it in the actual guidelines and both refer to child pornography.

>Ban the rise of the Mexican state.

This one seems entirely made up. Here's what the most verbose guideline says:

""A “sovereign Mexico” policy. Mexico is currently a national security disaster. Bluntly stated, Mexico can no longer qualify as a first-world nation; it has functionally lost its sovereignty to muscular criminal cartels that effectively run the country. The current dynamic is not good for either U.S. citizens or Mexicans, and the perfect storm created by this cartel state has negative effects that are damaging the entire hemisphere. The next Administration must both adopt a posture that calls for a fully sovereign Mexico and take all steps at its disposal to support that result in as rapid a fashion as possible.""

Every other mention of ""Mexico"" refers to immigration, drugs, or some minor stuff like common energy security and whatnot.

So that's 0/2. I won't bother continuing, as most of it doesn't even have anything to do with defense.",r/lesscredibledefence,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZd1JwZmpTbWFtaGRqSVRDeFlhYldCNi0xcnNCdmQwcVZVNzVtZ0FRMnNITzZqRnZFY0dia3FwenFvamdKOXh3YmlRWWRyZlBaSHRHRlUwamNPWUJpbXc9PQ==

"> Protests have erupted across Okinawa following revelations that the Japanese government withheld information about US troops’ sexual assaults on local women, with residents expressing outrage and demanding greater accountability from Tokyo.

> “The situation is absolutely miserable,” said Shinako Oyakawa, a rights activist who is also involved in local politics in Japan’s southernmost prefecture.

> “No one is standing up for us,” she said. “The Japanese government continues to expose the people of Okinawa to this sort of risk and the victims get no help.

> “They have told us for decades that the US military is here to protect us, but the opposite is true. People are furious and I hope this can be the turning point for the bases in Okinawa.”

> In Tokyo, Yoshimasa Hayashi, the government’s top spokesman, told reporters that the incidents had not been reported to local authorities in order to “protect the victims’ privacy” – an excuse that has attracted widespread derision.

> The government’s case was further undermined when Hayashi confirmed that it had withheld information on three more cases of sexual assault against Okinawan women – in February and August 2023 and again in January 2024 – from the prefectural authorities. Hayashi declined to provide further details on the incidents because none of the US servicemen was indicted.

> “It takes months for us to find out what has happened and, in that time, there have been more incidents,” Oyakawa said. “If the authorities had known, then maybe something could have been done to avoid those other attacks. People feel helpless, they feel unsafe.”

> Okinawan linguist and activist Byron Fija directs his anger at the local government, as well as the US military and the authorities in Tokyo.

> Fija, who never knew his American father and was adopted by his mother’s older brother, has taken part in protests.

> “Our politicians here all say it is terrible each time this happens and that they are angry and are going to lodge protests with the US and Tokyo, but nothing ever happens,” he said. “And nothing changes. Okinawan women are assaulted and we get the same comments from the same politicians. Our political leaders are cowards.”

> Fija said Okinawan people had been “brainwashed” by the government and the media to believe that the bases were critical for Japan’s safety because of the threat posed to the region by China.

"Similar vibes from Nehru and the India political leadership during the 1962 border war with China. Although to be fair, the Indian military brass were vocally opposed to the Forward Policy driving this looming disaster.

Nehru was absolutely convinced that a military ouster of China from the disputed border areas would not prompt any response from the PLA. This despite the many clear and increasingly urgent warnings from the Chinese side leading up to the war.

> Another anecdote exemplifies Indian thinking right up to the eve of the war. On 13 October 1962, a week before the outbreak of hostilities, in an exchange between Indian Foreign Secretary M.J. Desai and US Ambassador John Kenneth Galbraith, Desai remarked that there “would be no extensive Chinese reaction because of their fear of the US – “It is you they really fear”.

"These pro-military spending articles are becoming tiring. Especially since they are visibly encouraged by the US Government. A few things to remember:

- The US allied block isn't exactly a minor military spender. This block makes about 50% of the global GDP and 75% of the global military spending.

- Most of the current Western nations spend ""low"" because they would suffer economic consequences from spending more. Low debt, high-growth economies of the 20th century don't exist anymore. For example how could the likes of Belgium and Italy spend more?

- And the most important question: Why should we spend more. People for certain don't think we are under threat, going by recruitment numbers. The Russian military was the only credible threat against Europe. And it had visible weaknesses (such as having no fighters with AESA radars). It was also much smaller than the collective military of European NATO. Even I wrote on a forum years before the invasion that they would at best invade the Baltics and the easternmost portions of Poland before getting pushed back. In Ukraine, they performed even worse than the likes of me thought they would.

"It looks like the US is going to revive all the old failed anti-China operations. The trade war playbook that worked against Japan in the 80/90s might not be effective against China’s economy. 

There’s probably too much money flowing into the anti-China campaigns, so they can afford to throw everything at the wall to see what sticks. 

This is a repeat of the 1950s era (continued into 70s) CIA Tibet clandestine operation to sow discord and agitate for secession. The “ST BAILEY” operation was the propaganda component of the overall strategy. 

The CIA does have a sense of humor, they knew the entire operation was a clown show — one operation component was called “ST CIRCUS” with the other component operations called “BARNUM” and “BAILEY” — Barnum and Bailey is a famous circus show, that sadly has seen better days in the early/mid 20th century.

"Bold of you to assume most of these F-16s will make ot of the ground lol.

Iskander, Kinzhal, Kh-101, Kh-59 and Kh-69 will all be going their way, together with the usual Geraniums. 

They can't protect their vital energy infrastructure and lost the majority of their air force. I doubt these F-16s will do much at all, especially considering that the Russians are always willing to pay their troops a premium for destroyed western supplies. So you can pack on top of that a couple guys with Su-35s, Su-30s, Su-27s, MiG-31s and the occasional Su-57 (which operation is indicated by it's signature Kh-69 air-to-ground armament, designed specifically to be carried internally by the aircraft and used to destroy the largest thermal power plant in Kiev oblast), all looking to get some pocket money from the DoD on top of their salary. 

Furthermore, every dead F-16 pilot will be a huge blow as training took extremely long for them. 

Furthermore they will also have to go up against a ton of SAMs and other anti-air systems operating.

This environment over Ukraine isn't friendly towards aircraft, especially not towards Ukrainian aircraft. There's a reason why they generally keep their aircraft far behind the frontline and focus on trying to launch long range missiles.

"> But is a GBU-39 better than whatever the SU-35 is slinging? Fuck yeah.

Not really, it can carry the KAB-250 which is pretty much the equivalent, or the KAB-500 which trades range for a larger warhead. On top of that the Su-35 can carry several FAB models equipped with glide kits, air-to-ground missiles, long range cruise missiles (Kh-59), short to medium range air-to-air missiles (R-73), long range air-to-air missiles (R-77-1) and super long range air-to-air missiles (R-37M).

The Su-35 has definitely more variety and the much higher payload capacity. It's the better air superiority fighter and can carry basically as much as an F-15E.

"> how will the American military stop it from happening again?

History shows they won't. 

It's been a problem since the base was established.

Okinawa suffered particularly badly:

They beat her, duct-taped her eyes and mouth shut, and bound her hands. Gill and Harp then raped her, ""
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yumiko-chan\\_incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yumiko-chan_incident) - "" rape and murder of five-year-old Japanese girl Yumiko Nagayama, sometimes reported as Yumiko Arakaki, by American soldier ‌Sergeant Isaac J.

And this isn't an accident or ""one bad apple"".

The occupying forces understand exactly what'll happen.

1. Take a bunch of fresh-out-of-high-school boys 
2. Send them through abusive violence training (boot camp)
3. Isolate them with a bunch of other boys who were also desensitized to violence
4. Stick them in a community far from their homes and families so they don't emphasize with locals
5. Give them a place to run-and-hide where the local police (or even the federal police for overseas bases) can't touch them

While they aren't literally ordering those boys to oppress the native populations, they know exactly what they're doing -- and have decades of statistics showing exactly how much it will happen.

I think it's part of their formula for:

1. letting those occupied territories know who's the boss, as well as
2. desensitize their troops to abusive violence so they won't flinch when asked to slaughter people around the world without having moral objections.",r/lesscredibledefence,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYVBFWlAtUm5PdHNsQXpwZWdfQWNpN0paQWxTbXZqWGM2cmNMNDRDZFFfQjVkTUJ1LXpEenVsUDhBdVJzMkxnNXIxQ0xMQndVazVMblZkbWRqU28zMEtHc0NpMlNKZmNjdGhNR0RQMzV4VFk9

I watched the first 5mins of your video before I couldn't tolerate the bullshit any longer. To sum it up, the person tried to handwave the Dalai Lama disgusting behaviour by giving 2 points of defence.

1) Him and his family grew up kissing one another since they were young. Therefore, the Dalai Lama did it as a 'friendly' act.

2) Sticking out a person tongue is a way of showing friendliness in Tibetan culture. Therefore, nothing wrong with Dalai Lama words.

The issue is that the boy and the Dalai Lama were neither family nor friends. It is unacceptable in modern society for somebody to wrap his hands on another person and kiss said person unwarranted. Especially not towards a **minor**.

“*Just did some simplified calculations [no air resistance and assuming the sm6 w/ booster is launched straight up]*

*At 174 kN of constant thrust from the 788kg booster pushing a 712kg missile, 475 kg of rocket propellant burned over 6s, launched at 0 height, the ship launched sm6 reaches a height of 2106m @ 1400 m/s at the time the booster fuel runs out. This is equivalent to ~713 Mj of energy.*

*Launched from a super hornet going 400m/s over the ground [mach 1.35] @ 10000m [~33000ft], the sm6 will have around ~137 Mj of energy.*

*Considering the ship launched sm6 w/ booster is going significantly faster, although at a much lower altitude with significantly higher air density [the major source of deacceleration at that point], I would wager that the missile will have comperable ranges in either scenario.

"That's cool and all, but considering the guy you are commenting gets some simple facts very wrong (because he is using Chinese estimations), I am not taking anything he says as a fact and the fact you did means you shouldn't be commenting about this matter:

>*At 174 kN of constant thrust from the 788kg booster pushing a 712kg missile*

The [Mk72 Booster weighs 1,500lbs (680kgs)](https://www.secretprojects.co.uk/data/attachments/191/191314-20d51147a0e5f23c0cfe83d3a25db67d.jpg) meaning the AIM-174B itself weighs 1,800 lbs (816kgs) i.e. in this calculation, the Mk72 somehow weighs 100kgs more then it actually does, and the missile itself weighs 100kgs less then it actually does, this also means they probably gave the Mk72 booster 100kgs more propellant then the Mk72 actually has......

FYI this means every single calculation is wrong i.e. the booster time is off, the amount of propellant it has as well as the amount of thrust it produces is all wrong.....

The figures he is using are estimation coming from a Chinese report called the ""***Parameter Estimation and Analysis of Standard-2 Missile***"", meaning the guy you are quoting to is basing what he is stating off of a Chinese report that simply estimated these figures, however as I have already noted, everything they have given is way off, thus these figures cannot be trusted and neither can this calculation.

Next:

>“*Just did some simplified calculations \\[no air resistance and assuming the sm6 w/ booster is launched straight up\\] + But without knowing the trajectory or force of drag from air, I can’t say for certain.*”

Even though I have shown that everything he calculates is irrelevant because the figures are wrong, it further becomes irrelevant because the whole point of launching from a high altitude is to get away from the issues caused by the force of drag on said missile, the fact he cannot include this in his calculation doesn't actually help you case, there is also the fact the SM-6 is not launched straight up, but whatever.

"For the record, the answer is literally a Golden Urn, which is used to select each lama reincarnation. Without selection by the Golden Urn, they required the blessing, err, the approval of the emperor — which in modern times the state (PRC) has taken over responsibility for. 

There’s much closer historical ties of the Tibetans to the rest of China than people generally realize. The “Dalai” in Dalia Lama is a Mongol word, with the title bestowed on the lama from a Mongol khan (Altman Khan) under the suzerainty of the Chinese Ming dynasty.

"This isn’t true. 

The Golden urn was a Qing institution, not a Chinese one. It was given legitimacy by the Tibetans. It was also only used less than half the time it was supposed to. 

Tibetans never gave legitimacy for the Chinese to continue it. Hence why Tibetans chose the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama without China’s input. 

There really aren’t any historical ties between China and Tibet. The greatest influence China had on Tibet was introducing tea..

Alton Khan wasn’t under suzerainty of the Ming. To try and imply that China had anything to do with the Dalai Lama title or position is absurd at best.

From Forging the Golden Urn; 

Oidtman explains “the reforms of 1793 were as much about centralizing the authority of the Ganden Podrang government-and the Geluk church within that government-than about asserting imperial decision-making authority” (p.141). He goes on to write **”According to Wei Yuan, the Golden Urn was emblematic of the unprecedented expansion of “China”. In equating the Great Qing State with China in this way, Wei Yuan presaged the elisions of modern Chinese nationalists and the historians of the PRC, who have similarly refined the Golden Urn as a symbol of CHinese sovereignty. Yet, neither the Qinglong emperor nor contemporaneous Tibetan Chroniclers saw it in such terms. On the contrary, it was a symbol of the Qing imperial house’s, vested interest in promoting the Geluk teachings…The Golden Urn was a uniquely *Qing* ritual whose animating principles could not outlive the Qing state”** (p.143). 

In 1936 the ROC issued the “Law of the Method of the Reincarnation of Lamas”, which for all intents just changed the name of the Qing institutions to those of the ROC institutions and that all lamas were to be reincarnated using this method and no new lineages were to be established (p.147). No Lama was identified under this law. 

The first case of reincarnation under the PRC was the Fifth Jamyang Zhepa (which the Golden Urn was used previously for). PRC officials didn’t insist on the Golden Urn to be used (p.148). Furthemore, the PRC didn’t “sanction nor obstruct the searches for reincarnations, and official publications made little mention of the Golden Urn.”

But why does China care now? As Oidtman writes, the Geluk church is an obstacle to the assimilation of the Tibetans, a bridgehead for Tibetan nationalism, and the potential foundation of an independent Tibetan State” (p. 22).. 

It wasn’t until the Tenth Panchen Lama died in 1989 that the PRC wanted to use the Golden Urn. Due to the upheaval in Tibet at the time the PRC felt their control over Tibet was an issue (p. 148). When the Dalai Lama announced the new eleventh Panchen Lama, the PRC decided to use the Golden Urn to limit the Dalai Lama’s power. China is trying to use the Golden Urn to control Tibet, but as Sperling writes they (china) is “ignoring a crucial basis for the use of the Golden Urn: Acceptance of the ruler as an animation of Manjughosa **(Manjusri)**.” https://elliotsperling.org/reincarnation-and-the-golden-urn-in-the-19th-century-the-recognition-of-the-8th-panchen-lama/",r/lesscredibledefence,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZWWlIeVRCZnV6MU5BR3Fsb0xob1dOZXV0Ylh1NmRUeFZUVk5CMTlOeHBYSjFWYUhzWUM1aFliNlJFbzJNUVp2TUpDX0x5UU9oNWxaWTZVMnREVmNZZ0E9PQ==

>**The CIA officer, Bruce Walker, who oversaw the operations of CIA-trained Tibetan agents, was troubled by the hostility which the Tibetans showed towards his agents: ""the radio teams were experiencing major resistance from the population inside Tibet"". The CIA trained Tibetans from 1957 to 1972, in the United States, and parachuted them back into Tibet to organise rebellions against the PLA. In one incident, one agent was immediately reported by his own brother and all three agents on the team were arrested. They were not mistreated.

">Bro you’re active in deprogram. The Chinese propaganda narrative..

The deprogram is a subreddit mostly made up of Western leftist. Discussing China is only a niche part of the subreddit and most of the subreddit is discussing issues that Western society faces. Trying to paint this subreddit as a Chinese propaganda narrative/outlet is nothing short of laughable.

>Except you didn’t describe his actions accurately…I gave you a video which included the entire event and the context behind everything. 

And I debunked that nonsense video. Here, read again:

I watched the first 5mins of your video before I couldn't tolerate the bullshit any longer. To sum it up, the person tried to handwave the Dalai Lama disgusting behaviour by giving 2 points of defence.

1) Him and his family grew up kissing one another since they were young. Therefore, the Dalai Lama did it as a 'friendly' act.

2) Sticking out a person tongue is a way of showing friendliness in Tibetan culture. Therefore, nothing wrong with Dalai Lama words.

The issue is that the boy and the Dalai Lama were neither family nor friends. It is unacceptable in modern society for somebody to wrap his hands on another person and kiss said person unwarranted. Especially not towards a **minor**.

The Dalai Lama is somebody with influence and prestige and in a position of power(relative to the boy) while the boy is a minor with little to no power(relative to the Dalai Lama), thus making it impossible for the boy to give consent for the disgusting behaviour.

>That’s not an example of a strawman example. A strawman is an argument the replying person attacks of which wasn’t the original argument…

Which was exactly my point. We are discussing the disgusting behaviour of pedo Dalai Lama. Why bring up what other Chinese grandparents do? It isn't related to the discussion at hand.

Its literally in the first 5min. He talked about how him and his tibetan family grew up in a household where they kissed one another and it was a 'normal' part of their lifestyle and that sticking tongue out is part of tibetan tradition.

>Says who? Bet you didn’t know the boy was already on stage and they were goofing around like family.

Nope. Lol at tryna equate grabbing somebody's head and kissing him = goofing around like family.

South Korea's a rich country with a capable and well developed defense industry that can focus on innovation, and even in their case, it's going to take several years before they can get this network operational to a point where they've got the desired level of coverage over the DMZ, much less if they want to expand it to cover places beyond the border. 

Ukraine wasn't in any kind of economical or technological shape to develop a network like this before the invasion, and besides those considerations, you also need to look at the sheer scale of the area in question. South Korea isn't tiny by any means, but it isn't exactly big, whereas Ukraine is the largest country that's wholly in Europe, and 80-something percent of that which is still in Ukrainian hands makes for an incredibly large area to cover.

>Saying you did, doesn't mean you did...

I debunked the two points that he made in the first 5min of his video...

>nonsense"" because it goes against your narrative. Maybe it's why you can't refute anything from the video.

I refuted that nonsense video. Here, read again:

I watched the first 5mins of your video before I couldn't tolerate the bullshit any longer. To sum it up, the person tried to handwave the Dalai Lama disgusting behaviour by giving 2 points of defence.

1) Him and his family grew up kissing one another since they were young. Therefore, the Dalai Lama did it as a 'friendly' act.

2) Sticking out a person tongue is a way of showing friendliness in Tibetan culture. Therefore, nothing wrong with Dalai Lama words.

The issue is that the boy and the Dalai Lama were neither family nor friends. It is unacceptable in modern society for somebody to wrap his hands on another person and kiss said person unwarranted. Especially not towards a **minor**.

The Dalai Lama is somebody with influence and prestige and in a position of power(relative to the boy) while the boy is a minor with little to no power(relative to the Dalai Lama), thus making it impossible for the boy to give consent for the disgusting behaviour.

>LOL He brings this up as the background..not the reason...

"Anyone who's spent even a minute in Tibet will appreciate that the local culture isn't being ""repressed"":
One academic's discussion on visiting Tibet ([45s mark] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z7sEI-ZtRA)): ""[I] had been told many times it's illegal to posses a picture of the Dhali Lama... when I arrived in Lhasa ... there were pictures of the Dhali Lama being sold in stalls right there on the street. This is one of those moments of cognitive dissonance.""

If one digs deeper into these allegations of ""repression,"" it turns out that it oftentimes means things like agitating for secession. It doesn't matter what your religious practices are, if you break the laws (or are suspected of breaking them), the government can come down hard of you (see, e.g., the Waco Texas Davidians religious minority).

---


I'm going to use this as an excuse to share my travel experience. First a caveat: China in general has seen dramatic changes on a yearly basis, so some of the below might be out dated.

For Tibet travel, to give away the plot, I think it's one of the few worthwhile travel destinations. Tibet has such geographic/scenic, cultural, religious, historical, strategic/military significance that each facet alone is worth the price of admission.

How to travel to Tibet: A travel permit (in addition to any PRC visa requirements) for visiting Tibet is mandatory, and you *must* travel with an organized tour group. Or so they say. I know for a fact that this organized tour requirement is false, because I traveled to Tibet as a foreigner without being accompanied by anyone, not a tour guide, not an organized tour, no one. Unfortunately, I do not know the process to avoid the organized tour requirement because someone helped me get the permit.

I met a US national who was living and studying Chinese in Lhasa. She obviously did not have a tour guide. So on my trip, there were at least two foreigners visiting Tibet alone without tour guides.

On the need for a tour guide. The local culture is incredibly sensitive to the slightest missteps (literally). On my visit, I had decided to see the Potala Palace. As I was walking up to the Potala Palace on what I thought was the path towards the front entrance, someone popped out ahead and yelled at me. I had no clue what he was yelling, but he eventually gestured to go around. The entrance is actually on the far left side, and the exit (what I thought was the entrance) is the middle front area.

So, I've come to understand that the act of walking in the ""wrong direction"" is offensive to their culture -- so this is the level of sensitivity we're talking about. Similarly, their prayer wheel *must* absolutely be spun in the ""right"" direction; it's offensive otherwise. I got into another incident that I'm not going to share... so maybe traveling with a tour group is for the best.

On the other hand, I was still allowed into the Potala Palace (after paying the foreigner admissions price), and no one bothered me as I was coming down the exit.

If you visit, ask yourself if you know their religious and cultural practices on literally which direction to walk. Do you know their prayer wheel customs and rituals? If ""no"" to either, you might just consider going with a tour.

Some fun facts:

- They discriminate and charge foreigners higher prices for admission to the Potala Palace; locals pay a smaller fee.
- The clock-time compared to the sun-in-the-sky-time feels weird; China insists on a single time zone and this is the result.
- Everest Base Camp is a jeep ride away from the city; although the base camp is not remotely close to actually climbing Everest, it's still an interesting site to visit.
- Interesting local foods and beer, but my recollection is poor on this.",r/lesscredibledefence,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaanoxV0N5RHZTSHhWc0dOLXZRQnUzWndiTDlXMnBaaVZHZ0ZUOEF6TEdDN2k1NXVkUnNmUEM2aTNFSXJLTWFwSUo1U2Joc0dTS2dwcjkwOF9QV0FQdWc9PQ==

"A contradiction is basically saying ""no"" to statements without actually refuting them. This is what you did.

The fact remains that Tibetan death squads trained by the CIA failed to garner support for their rebellion from the now freed Tibetan serfs, who were once seen as subhuman property of their rapist monk overlords. This is why ""skinned human thangkas"" (NSFW don't look it up) was a thing back in the theocracy.

As for Tibetan monks being rapists and Dalai Lama's inappropriate sexual comments to an underage boy, it's just the latest of a common theme of disgusting perverts abusing their status as religious authority to take advantage of young victims:

"> Any two Han persons have more in common, I’m sure, than rural Tibetans have with Han.

More in common? Culturally, perhaps. The fact remains that Han is a genetic mixing pot of an ethnicity, because China simply cares more about unity by culture and civilization rather than by blood.

Meanwhile, the link you provided about ""Tibetans outbreeding Hans"" as well as the Uighur terrorists US supports are actively promoting ideals of genocidal ethnostates, which is why they are harshly suppressed. The few times ""East Turkestan"" tried to form in the last century, they first massacre or expulse all non-Uighurs including those who have lived there for generations.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang#Demographics

*Political killings and expulsions of non-Uyghur populations during the uprisings in the 1860s and the 1930s saw them experience a sharp decline as a percentage of the total population though they rose once again in the periods of stability from 1880, which saw Xinjiang increase its population from 1.2 million, to 1949. From a low of 7 percent in 1953, the Han began to return to Xinjiang between then and 1964, where they comprised 33 percent of the population (54 percent Uyghur), like in Qing times.*

And it is exactly due to the successes of China's relatively bloodless anti-terrorism/separatism policies that gained the support of the Global South, including the OIC Muslim countries. Meanwhile the US actively supports genocidal ethnostates like modern Israel, and continues to perpetuate a violent war between two peoples for perhaps centuries more. Countless deaths of innocents later, and lasting peace is still far from the horizon.

"There are several hurdles to using off-the-shelf consumer drones in sensitive areas.  

Consumer drones must literally broadcast their user’s location in real time (FAA Remote ID law). So anyone (like law enforcement) with the ground station will be able to see where you (your controller’s gps location) and your drone are in real-time. 

Even without this law and the station, consumer drones operate in the so-called ISM band that is a fixed set of bands in a fixed set of frequencies. Anyone with frequency meter can see these transmissions to/from the controller (the user) and the drone. 

They tend to be low power and easy to jam.  

So there are real hurdles to using consumer drones. 

If you venture outside of the consumer drone space and are willing and able to build and program your own drone, then there’s probably not too much the authorities can do in the moment (but they can and will do something after). 

With custom programming, you can use any other suitable frequency bands, however powerful you want, frequency hopping/spread spectrum. Such a drone would probably be both difficult to detect in time and difficult to counteract using jamming. 

For anyone doubting — these are quite mature technologies. 

But you will 100% be hunted down and brought to justice. And people with the technical knowledge and ability are almost without exception not criminally insane (with the clear exception of the UNABOMBER).

"Ethno-states are historically much more stable and united; this is objective fact, not ""US propaganda."" Social psychology has shown that people tend to work better with those who they identify with; and that is why multiculturalism as practiced in liberalism is typically a failure in the long-term.

Whether that identification needs to be genetic or not, is still up for debate. But culturally, there is no dispute. It doesn't matter how a state sees itself. What matters is whether its policies can successfully create a common cultural identity with which all constituents can identify. That is why I wish the CCP the best of luck, because in China, as in the US, and as else where, the struggles with multiculturalism have been material.

It has the same meaning as the Chinese name Zhongguo (中國; 'Middle kingdom').[12][13][14] The Qing identified their state as ""China"" (Zhongguo), and referred to it as Dulimbai Gurun in Manchu. The Qing equated the lands of the Qing state, including present day Manchuria, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet and other areas as ""China"" in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi ethnic state, rejecting the idea that China only meant Han areas, proclaiming that both Han and non-Han peoples were part of China, using ""China"" to refer to the Qing in official documents, international treaties, and foreign affairs, and the 'Chinese language' (Dulimbai gurun i bithe) referred to Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and the term Zhongguo zhi ren (中國之人; ᡩᡠᠯᡳᠮᠪᠠᡳ ᡤᡠᡵᡠᠨ ‍ᡳ ᠨᡳᠶᠠᠯᠮᠠ Dulimbai gurun-i niyalma 'Chinese people') referred to all Han, Manchu, and Mongol subjects of the Qing.[15]

"I very carefully excerpted a paragraph that directly addressed your knuckleheaded nonsense. You linked a page about a broad research program that in parts _explicitly disagrees with your own gibberish_. 

> William T. Rowe wrote that the name ""China"" (Zhongguo or Zhonghua) was apparently understood to refer to the political realm of the Han Chinese during the Ming dynasty, and this understanding persisted among the Han Chinese into the early Qing dynasty, and the understanding was also shared by Aisin Gioro rulers before the Ming-Qing transition. **The Qing, however, ""came to refer to their more expansive empire not only as the Great Qing but also, nearly interchangeably, as China"" within a few decades of this development. Instead of the earlier (Ming) idea of an ethnic Han Chinese state, this new Qing China was a ""self-consciously multi-ethnic state""**. Han Chinese scholars had some time to adapt this, but by the 19th century, the notion of China as a multinational state with new, significantly extended borders had become the standard terminology for Han Chinese writers. Rowe noted that ""these were the origins of the China we know today"". He added that while the early Qing rulers viewed themselves as multi-hatted emperors who ruled several nationalities ""separately but simultaneously"", by the mid-19th century the Qing Empire had become part of a European-style community of sovereign states and entered into a series of treaties with the West, and such treaties and documents consistently referred to Qing rulers as the ""Emperor of China"" and his administration as the ""Government of China"".[37]

> Joseph W. Esherick observes that while the Qing Emperors governed frontier non-Han areas in a different, separate system under the Lifan Yuan and kept them separate from Han areas and administration, **it was the Manchu Qing Emperors who expanded the definition of Zhongguo (中國) and made it ""flexible"" by using that term to refer to the entire empire.[**38] Similarly, Elena Barabantseva has also noted that **the Manchu referred to all subjects of the Qing empire regardless of ethnicity as ""Chinese"", and they used the term Zhongguo as a synonym for the entire Qing empire** but used ""Hanren"" to refer only to the core area of the empire, with the entire empire viewed as multiethnic.[39]

This is way too one sided. Especially now with the rapid rise in living standards they will have a more warm and cozy feeling toward the central government. Plus, there’s a minority (looks to be just under a quarter) who are essentially minorities within a minority that practices separate religions (Bon and folk religion). These other religious minorities in Tibet have nothing to do with the Dalia Lama.

It’s also possible for Tibetans to favor the Dalia Lama AND at the same time have pride in their country (I.e., China).

"The EU has long since stopped being a ""junior partner"".  Europe was only a ""junior partner"" when the US and the USSR were fighting over the pieces.  Once the USSR broke apart and the EU fully formed, the EU has been entirely independent of the US.  The EU and the US have similar sized populations and economic power, and the EU has only grown into a stronger and more coherent government.  All of this was with the US's strong encouragement.  The US can't push the EU to do anything, and vice versa.

The US and EU tend to agree... because they share similar outlooks on many things, have similar values, similar governments, and have similar interests.  It's not a weird coincidence or a shadowy US plot that results in most of the liberal democracies being generally cordial and agreeable with each other, and tending to move in the same direction, with plenty of internal bickering a disagreements along the way.

The EU is only going to continue to strengthen, and its a good thing.  It means Europe will keep its backyard clear of external threats, deal with their own internal divisions without resorting to armies, there is one set of regulatory standards in the EU market, and one entity you can negotiate with when needing to do ""big things"" (whatever they might be) geopolitically.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet_Autonomous_Region#Demographics

*Most Han people in the Tibet Autonomous Region (12.2% of the total population) are recent migrants, because all of the Han were expelled from ""Outer Tibet"" (Central Tibet) following the British invasion until the establishment of the PRC.*

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang#Demographics

*Political killings and expulsions of non-Uyghur populations during the uprisings in the 1860s and the 1930s saw them experience a sharp decline as a percentage of the total population though they rose once again in the periods of stability from 1880, which saw Xinjiang increase its population from 1.2 million, to 1949. From a low of 7 percent in 1953, the Han began to return to Xinjiang between then and 1964, where they comprised 33 percent of the population (54 percent Uyghur), like in Qing times.*

History shows the first thing those attempting to forming racially pure ethnostates out of Chinese territory is to murder or expel all non-Tibetan/non-Uighur locals. You're on the side of genocide.

">The US can't push the EU to do anything, and vice versa.

EU was much more independent following the end of the cold war, compared to now. In the early 2000s EU countered and opposed USA's tariff war with its own economic policy, when's the last time we did that? USA has implemented and continues to implement new tariffs that affect EU all the time, but currently we just whine about it and don't do anything.

From a geopolitical POV, in the early 2000s up to around 2010 EU still had some level of independent policy. The wars in the middle east were opposed hard by at least western EU, the initiative by USA to grant Ukraine and Georgia MAP was also directly opposed by EU. 

Economically, EU pursued its own energy partners and did not seek out USA. This actually goes back to even the Cold War, but it stayed true for about ~30years+ since that point when there was an oil crisis in the middle east.

>The US and EU tend to agree... because they share similar outlooks on many things, have similar values, similar governments, and have similar interests. It's not a weird coincidence or a shadowy US plot

USA has overwhelming influence over EU, mainly through NATO. EU and USA share values and general ideas about governance, that is true; but the idea that we overlap on all policies is absurd. Geopolitically, there is a lot of agreement; but the states that tend to agree with USA tend to be the most influenced by it as well. But even if you assume that's not true, there's still plenty of disagreements you can find in regards to Russia, Israel, China, etc.

In any case, if EU and  USA never had any disagreements; how do you explain the [EU-USSR gas/oil infrastructure linkage in the 80s](https://warontherocks.com/2022/04/the-lessons-of-reagans-pipeline-crisis-for-competing-with-china/)? Or, how do you explain deGaulle's statements about NATO; and France leaving the unified NATO command in the 60s?

>which is why the US has always been strongly pro-EU.

USA has been pro-EU, I agree; but there's many ways to be ""pro- EU"". USA does not want EU to have strategic autonomy, this is something EU has been fine with most of the time with the exception of France--because USA has been quite fair in this arrangement. 

The issue is that we're entering a multi-polar world. USA will have to contend with China more and more. Depending on what USA does, EU might end up getting the short end of the stick and I think that's a very likely scenario. Mario Draghi and Macron have mentioned the challenges that are facing EU in the face of Russian aggression, and China's rising status; but you know they also mention USA as an issue. You can say that's just Macron being Macron, since France has always been a bit more critical of USA; but Mario Draghi is an EU technocrat. He's talked a bit about this stuff, but he's also writing a big report that's going to be released in like 1-2 months.",r/lesscredibledefence,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnbGxlQ2xTekhSUlB3aVJITldXd1ZRblJIY09Wc3ZmUF9vZWxEemR4aVFMcHVZeGdXalZwWUctVkdqVlpRMERTR1FITHFrNHc4cXpIbmFtbGJmUUxUYlE9PQ==

"There's plenty of ways soft power is much more important than hard power, and like I said both USSR and China have feared those aspects of it. 

Look up 'peaceful evolution theory' or perhaps Wang Huning's America Against America; those chapters where he analyzes how ideology and social/cultural values can end up having the biggest geopolitical impact. Also, consider his position within the CCP and how China has been orienting the last ~10years.

For USSR/Russia, you can look up George Kennan's Long Telegram address; where he talks about what the best way would be to defeat USSR; it's still relevant to this day.

Great powers rarely fight each other directly, they'll usually be ""nicer about it"" first; then pursue proxy wars, and only in the end use hard power. But in the modern age, soft power has become much more important because informational warfare is way easier to utilize. 

During the Cold War, in the domain of hard power USSR was very powerful, and while I'd never argue they could directly match USA, I'd say that in the military domain they were closest to that. Economically, diplomatically, socially/culturally; they had major issues. USA waged plenty of proxy-wars in the Cold War and saw very little apparent success from using its hard power; what won the Cold War was soft power. Warsaw Pact was kept together not by soft power, but by hard power; and the moment USSR flinched it all collapsed. USA on the other hand, never needed to have such a fear over its own spheres of influence, because they utilized soft power instead.

By falsely claiming China is supporting Russia and threatening more confrontation with Beijing, I don't see how it will ease the tension in Ukraine.

"> Furthermore, that doesn’t mean an independent Tibet would do that now.

Tibetan Chinese now decide their own future, free from the influence of rapist slaver monks and their ""living gods"". The Dalai Lama had his chance, and he chose to work with the CIA and support genocidal death squads to kill anyone non-Tibetan.

*‘We only lived to kill Chinese,’ recalled one Tibetan veteran. ‘Our hopes were high.’ One of the trainees, Gyato Wangdu (who would later become the last commander of the Chushi Gandrug), asked CIA operations officer Roger McCarthy for ‘a portable nuclear weapon of some kind…that the trainees might employ to destroy Chinese by the hundreds.’*

Now he begs and grovels from exile to return to Tibet before he dies, we'll see if the CCP show mercy to the old bastard and his kin. Probably not.

>Can you name any Native American country?

Lmao, it's okay to genocide and annex land that isn't yours so long as they didn't set up an internationally recognized nation-state in time. If that's the case, China retaking Tibet after their brief rebellion is more than acceptable, considering China didn't even genocide the Tibetans like the West did to the native Americans, and Tibet was not recognized as independent by anyone except Mongolia for a brief few years.

">The future of Tibet, doesn’t lie with the Dalai Lama.

Agreed. The future of Tibet lies with Tibetan Chinese, those who were once the serfs abused by their religious theocracy, whose descendants overwhelmingly live and thrive within China. The Dalai Lama and his exiles deserve to die out slowly in India and elsewhere, never to return to their roots. Tibetan exiles outside of China are destined to forget their culture, their history, forget everything about them that makes them Tibetan except for what their masters require to maintain the illusion, so they still have the ""right"" to poke China.

This is the most ironic and hilarious punishment, that Tibet as part of China moves on with the times, and left behind outdated relics and discarded tools (like your side) in the dust.

>it starts orally and can be passed through language

This is the 21st century, only knowing to speak but not being able to read or write is pathetic. There's a reason literacy rate is considered critical for a language to survive.

"It appears you and I have different definitions of ""soft power"". I don't consider regime change, colour revolutions, proxy wars as soft.

Information warfare i.e. propaganda is indeed soft power, but being intangible they can easily be eroded with time, and the backlash from spewing misinformation once revealed is severe (see: US anti-vaccine propaganda during COVID, US about Iraq WMDs etc.).

Soft power without hard power is useless. Hard power without soft power appears thuggish and uncivil, but no one can deny they work. Personally, I would rather the rampant gaslighting and malicious bullshit go away, and politicians strip away their masks of lies and speak truly.

US won the Cold War because the Soviets' hard power was degraded, and no amount of soft power would save the Union. US is now losing because their hard power cannot keep the rest of the world down, and their soft power is only delaying the inevitable.

As Mao said, political power grows out of the barrel of a gun. The monopoly on violence is the supreme authority of the state.

">Tibetan Chinese

First off, it's just Tibetans.

>ow decide their own future

Second, they don't...

>ree from the influence of rapist slaver monks and their ""living gods"".

Slavery that didn't exist? Remember I always ask you for an academic source for this and you can never provide one?

How come Tibetans inside of Tibet want the Dalai Lama back? How come the Chinese had to cancel the last fact finding mission of the Dalai Lama? Oh because it caused too much Tibetan nationalism and calling for the return of the Dalai Lama.

>The Dalai Lama had his chance, and he chose to work with the CIA and support genocidal death squads to kill anyone non-Tibetan.

He didn't work with the CIA...

LOL genocidal death squads, you mean the foreign chinese invaders?

>‘We only lived to kill Chinese,’ recalled one Tibetan veteran. ‘Our hopes were high.’ One of the trainees, Gyato Wangdu (who would later become the last commander of the Chushi Gandrug), asked CIA operations officer Roger McCarthy for ‘a portable nuclear weapon of some kind…that the trainees might employ to destroy Chinese by the hundreds.’

Yea...why wouldn't they want to kill the foreigners that invaded their country?

>Now he begs and grovels from exile to return to Tibet before he dies, we'll see if the CCP show mercy to the old bastard and his kin. Probably not.

Except he doesn't....if he did he would say Tibet was always a part of China, but he doesn't...

>Lmao, it's okay to genocide and annex land that isn't yours so long as they didn't set up an internationally recognized nation-state in time

Did I ever say it was Ok? But apparently *you* think it's OK...I just asked a simple question..

>If that's the case, China retaking Tibet after their brief rebellion is more than acceptable,

It wasn't a brief rebellion...

>considering China didn't even genocide the Tibetans like the West did to the native Americans

At the time it was pretty standard, not so much any more. You're right, China just invaded and annexed a country and is trying to manipulate and control a culture to have better control over a country. Not much better. One can be solved now, the other can't.

> Tibet was not recognized as independent by anyone except Mongolia for a brief few years.

Nepal considered Tibet to be a country. Furthermore, what is recognition defined as? When did recognition become standardied? Answer those and we can add more to the list. Oh, and theres more to a country then just international recognition...

>I don't really care about your identity, it doesn't matter at all to my argument.

If does. Your entire argument is whataboutism.
