"Russia isn't banned from using Cluster munitions, as they did not sign the Convention on Cluster Munitions. Ukraine didn't sign up to it either. So cluster bombs aren't banned. 

However, it might be argued that using cluster bombs is a war crime, in contravention of [Rule 71](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docindex/v1_rul_rule71), if an attack was so inaccurate it was incapable of targeting a specific military target i.e. indiscriminate. 

This was the legal argument used in the [Martić Case](https://www.icty.org/en/case/martic), the attack with cluster munition on Zagreb was judged to be a war crime because it was indiscriminate.

>In terms of answering the question of whether the cluster munition in a given attack was an indiscriminate weapon, one needs to examine the specific cluster munition that was used in that particular attack. A practical example of how this has been done can be found in the ICTY’s “Martić Case”. In this case the court examined the use by Serb forces of an un-guided projectile (M-87 Orkan) containing a cluster warhead with 288 bomblets, with each bomblet containing 420 pellets of 3mm in diameter. The rocket had a maximum firing range of 50 kilometres and was designed to explode and disperse the bomblets at a height of 800-1,000 metres above the target areas. It was calculated that the weapon had been fired on Zagreb from its maximum range, which gave it a dispersion error of around 1,000 metres in any direction. The expected area of dispersion of the bomblets on the ground was about two hectares and each bomblet had a lethal range of around 10 metres. The court concluded that by virtue of the particular weapon being unguided and the fact that being fired at the maximum of its range made it incapable of hitting specific targets and therefore an indiscriminate weapon.
