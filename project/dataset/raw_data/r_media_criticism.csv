He didn't say a single intelligent thing about policy in that entire debate.

And yes, Biden is also too old to govern.

But those of you supporting Trump have absolutely no basis for criticizing anyone. This guy is a compulsive liar and the entire platform of the Republican Party is designed to work for only wealthy people -- and anyone who supports Trump is a gullible dupe for supporting him (unless you are in the roughly 5% of the population who are helped by his economic policies).

"Trump is less fit, for different reasons.

Everyone saw this last Thursday too. Biden is also too old, no doubt, and should not be running.

But Trump's problems are so much worse. Corruption, compulsive lying, a policy agenda that would destroy accountability and worsen so many building crises. I mean, **the problem with the lying is the reason he's lying. That is, why does he have to lie so much?** Because his record as president was terrible and his policy agenda is designed to destroy competency in government (replaced with Trump loyalists -- see Project 2025).

If you don't see these things, it's because you're putting too much credence into the fact that Trump didn't stumble over words like Biden did. And this is causing you to ignore that Trump is so much worse.

"Every time you ask a conservative to defend their support for Donald Trump, they change the subject to divert attention from his terrible record and from your absence of principles or use some bullshit ad hominem attack like this.

You guys cannot ever, ever use any kind of substantive basis for defending him other than some vague belief based on your conservative ideology that he's got the best policies despite so much evidence to the contrary.

To answer your question though, I don't really want to have any Republican friends. And I barely can stand to be around someone with such a total absence of principles.

You may think of it as a protest against the system. A proclamation that neither candidate is suitable. That the system needs a reboot of some kind.

*The system does not care*. The system cares only about which number is higher between the two leading candidates. Low turnout may get a brief mention in news coverage but your still going to be stuck with whoever got the most actual votes for the next few years.

I'm in the UK - we have an election this week and I posted my vote last night. Our politics are a shambles too. I had more options than you - there were I think 7 candidates I could choose from - and I still wasn't able to full-heartedly choose any of them, but I chose what I consider to be the least-worst strategic option anyway, because there are options that I absolutely do not want to win and I want to do my bit to prevent them from gaining power. It's not much, but it's measurably better than nothing.

Whatever your politics, I don't believe it's possible that you honestly think that both candidates are equally as bad as each other. They are very different people with very different politics.

"I blame the people who work closely with Biden for not being more honest with themselves and with Biden.

I will say that I think it's not difficult to understand how this happens though. It's like, it's a big, huge deal that Biden won the presidency. He won. He is the president. The idea that he or his associates would just easily decide to step aside and let someone else take the job just doesn't make sense. Almost anybody in his place would stubbornly resist giving that up.

So certainly the media has some blame too, but they can only do so much. I don't know who to blame, to be honest. It's not like the other side would do anything different if Trump was known to be having cognitive decline.

The expectations we put on the media to somehow expose things are often frankly ridiculous.

If I had to put any blame on anyone, and I say this as a Democratic voter, it would be the whole leadership of the Democratic Party. They decide the process for selecting the nominee. And if they had a better process for choosing the nominee, Biden never would have won the nomination. It would take a long time to explain, but they should have had more debates starting earlier before the 2020 election and more aggressive removal of candidates from the debates as time went on. Instead, what we had was too many candidates vying in the primaries and then we had to suddenly panic and put all of their support behind Biden simply because he had the best name recognition. A better process would have organically led us to the best candidate. That's what happened in 2008 when Obama emerged ahead of Hillary.",r/media_criticism,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOT0Nidk92SVIzTF95akdkWXdSeDFRMnA4RXE0TXFfbExIR2tObTJXcS1JcHJXejdYdXpGOXJiUGpFZmoxMDdtNnBLT0ZWdGNwTWJsQ1BWWWtfY3MxcWc9PQ==

"According to WURD:

>On July 3, the first post-debate interview with President Joe Biden was arranged and negotiated independently by WURD Radio host Andrea Lawful-Sanders without knowledge, consultation or collaboration with WURD management. The interview featured pre-determined questions provided by the White House, which violates our practice of remaining an independent media outlet accountable to our listeners. As a result, Ms. Lawful-Sanders and WURD Radio have mutually agreed to part ways, effective immediately.

Edit: I'd like to leave this post up, despite its lack of submission statement, because it's a great piece of media criticism and fun to read. In lieu of a submission statement, for the time being at least, I'll share these two paragraphs which capture the essence of it:

>Reading the Book Review is a joyless task because it is mostly so massively, stiflingly dull. There is a sameness and a flatness to the reviews, held as they are to some invisible set of Times “standards,” the most obvious one of which seems to be, “Never be interesting.” A recent review of Anthony Fauci’s memoir, On Call, describes it as “a well-pressed gray flannel suit of a book with a white coat buttoned over it,” as if its dullness is the best thing about it. Other than a mild comment about the overuse of “bureaucratese” (phrases like “proof of the pudding” and “pushing the envelope,” which are simply clichés), the entire “review” by Alexandra Jacobs reads like a dutifully written 8th-grade summary.  I have read reviews there by some of the wittiest writers whose prose sparkles elsewhere but who, when transplanted to the hallowed and hollow grounds of the Times, quietly shrivel and hush. To enter the world of the Book Review is to stumble into a boring tea party: everyone has nothing but niceties to murmur to each other, everyone is dropping quotes from Joan Didion and some dead white guys, and everyone’s tea is secretly laced with gin just to keep them going. 

>If there are opinions, especially negative ones, they are offered tremulously, coddled in several caveats, as in the review of Fauci’s book. This is by design. In 2018, Pamela Paul, the Book Review editor from 2013 to 2022, said that it “has a long tradition of being a political Switzerland.” Paul eventually left her post to become an insipid bourgeois reactionary columnist for the Times opinion section, which indicates that even she grew tired of faking neutrality. But the principle still holds at the publication, where the reviews are so bland and sleep-inducing that one is tempted to hold every reviewer by their feet, upside down and outside a window, threatening to let go: Give me an opinion, damn it! Now! Or I drop you! A book review doesn’t have to be a vicious takedown in order to be interesting, but it should demonstrate some sense of a personality behind the work, of someone unafraid to deliver keen and original insights.",r/media_criticism,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQYzBKSDdzZE5fZ3VqbHNvNlNHSHVyRTV4RXVNMnNNQlhqRkQtYUVBWDZ0LTNBcnlXalNrYUFweXc5Qll2emJXZ3BFZGVrUnRrZ2YyZkZVT1BLOUlyenc9PQ==

"Sorry, but no.

At what point can trump take blame for the hateful rhetoric that he posts on his platform every day?

Instead of blaming people for for calling him a fascist, why don't we blame him for actually being a fascist?  He literally has promised to seek vengeance and retribution if he had the power to.  THAT is what gets some crazed assholes motivated to take matters into their own hands.",r/media_criticism,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMWFyTjFFODVMZ3Bqb3VTRXE4NVdqODhxakdSUGlzSFhYU0FxZm1US2ZZajdmQmdCR0lzaGhhX1IxYU1rSi1nMEF5OFA4ODZlX1ZYLWYweUxJSUk3UFE9PQ==
"Really? So you don’t think the constant demonization of Trump and the constant stream of bombastic demonstrable lies that come from the left and their compliant media has absolutely nothing to do with it? You yourself are calling Trump a fascist right now and claiming the label is 100% accurate as though you (and everyone else who uses the term as meaningless slur) are the a ultimate authority on who is and isn’t a fascist. Racist, fascist, Nazi- All terms the left consistently use for no other reason than to vilify and demonize anyone who opposes them, by attempting to connect them to the most hated groups of people one can imagine. The left has co-opted labels that many people, including you I’m sure, would use as justification to commit violence against those you flippantly apply them too, just to use them as a petty insult in arguments with strangers on the internet. Claiming that Trump hasn’t been demonized continuously is outrageous. Assigning yourself the authority to declare, with little to no evidence that people are racist, fascist and Nazis is outrageous. Declaring  that your determination is unquestionable and those people deserve to have violence committed against them is outrageous. Pretending that the media and elected democrats haven’t lied constantly about him is outrageous. Claiming that Trump “brought this on himself” is just a continuation of that outrageous narrative.",r/media_criticism,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNabXBHdXZOQVk5RE12WERvVF9neG1qSzNiazI0N3h0SFB0WTBZTUJhWUpSZUlHcElkVXUzbm5Ga3dhTnI5MUpBcTNvVi1lODRlYmY0cUNMbUwzZUhlTXc9PQ==

"**Submission Statement**

The New York Post incorrectly published that the person who attempted to assassinate former President Trump was Chinese. I have no idea what the rationale was by the New York Post, but this seems like bullshit.

At a time where Asian-Americans are already still reeling from the stigma of being associated with Covid-19, for the New York Post to jump the gun and go after them like this is reprehensible. There's a pattern of this type of behavior from the Post as well. It's like they couldn't wait to blame an Asian person for this.",r/media_criticism,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaQm93TjhUbU1NdlJVSXFVTDh1SDVvX1hxX2ZGekFrODRSVmhaYWZONlV3bFN3aVRZTExub1gxeUpNZU9Gd0luczV5S3M4ZHdjSW1aUDdaalRlbUtWTVE9PQ==

"""At a time where Asian-Americans are already still reeling from the stigma of being associated with Covid-19"" this is about 1% truth, 99% CCP propaganda. ""Stop Asian Hate"" created a website encouraging people to self-report alleged hate crimes, and the media used that questionable data to support this dubious narrative. If anything, there was an increase in hatred towards Asian Americans from other minorities during the post 2020 BLM movement for having children who perform so well in the schools BLM leaders were desperate to characterize as ""racist.""",r/media_criticism,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaOGtMdkZQR1RlVUZVdWdhRW43a2pkbnpYc19ydWliMHpsN0U3aUdxTG02LW55dy1wYmYxSElUNGExSFctdFpjTUdhRjBrdW1HOUxOSUlPdnU0eDljMXc9PQ==
">If anything, there was an increase in hatred towards Asian Americans from other minorities during the post 2020 BLM movement for having children who perform so well in the schools BLM leaders were desperate to characterize as ""racist.""

The comment that you're replying to didn't even say anti-Asian racism was coming primarily from White people, so I'm not sure what your point is here or why you bring this up. Your comment first says that this isn't happening, then it says it's happening because of other minorities.
