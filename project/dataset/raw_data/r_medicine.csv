"Yup, our understanding of chronic headache has really improved in the past 10-15 years.  These patients are common in the ED as I'm sure you experience. Some easy things you guys can do in the ED for medication overuse/rebound chronic headache that take no time to do:

- tell patients no more than 2-3 days per week of tylenol/ibuprofen/goody powder etc and start OTC magnesium oxide 400mg daily supplement, its pretty harmless in patients with normal renal function, requires no script, and can work pretty well with >4 headache days a month. Tell them to cut the mag-ox in half if loose stools.

-Magnesium is great for headaches in general and I always add mag-sulfate 1gm to inpatient/ED headache cocktails.  

-No opiates for headaches, especially in the ED unless they have blood or tumor in the brain- solid data that rebound headaches increase with opiates acutely and chronically.  

-Medrol dosepak script to go is a great way to avoid rebounds back to the ED and self tapers.  Many headache docs give patients a prn script for this as a tool to avoid ED visits for IV meds entirely.

-Also, if you can learn occipital nerve blocks it's an extremely easy low risk procedure that takes 2 minutes to get chronic headache with occipital neuralgia out of your ED quick- if you palpate the lesser and greater occipital nerve regions on many chronic headache patients and they get tingling and pain it's very likely generating a lot of the symptoms, instant relief in some patients with 2-5cc 50/50 bupivicaine/lidocaine that can last for weeks, sometimes months.  You can just d/c them post procedure if they get quick relief.

All of this applies to PCPs too.

"Personally, I haven't had any issues thus far. I was simply empathizing with how difficult it can be and can see where this can be a problem. I think most would view this as a system issue. 

I can appreciate different practice styles. Another common issue, is patients are told to schedule a follow-up lab result visit, but they decide their diabetic follow-up visit is close enough. They decide not to schedule a lab visit, so it is never marked in the next visit notes that this is something that needs to be addressed.

"Maybe I don't get some of his frustrations because I am not a surgeon, but his complaint about healthy lifestyle putting surgeons out of work baffles me. Endocrinologists, cardiologists, and neurologists probably counsel patients on lifestyle modification at every visit, are they not worried about being out of work because patients would live too healthy to get diabetes, MI, and strokes? Even if all patients follow these recommendations, the results of their honest efforts often vary, not to mention how few of them actually follow through.

I can only help with the downstream effects to make their lives easier. I am at peace with that role.

"Sub specialist surgeon here:

I would love to get every single referral in immediately. In reality I operate 2-3 days a week and have clinic 2 days a week. Unfortunately patients are complex & get my full time and attention out of respect for them, me, and the referring clinician. I don‚Äôt double or triple book in clinic unless urgent because we can‚Äôt be in two places at once. I don‚Äôt run simultaneous OR‚Äôs because we can‚Äôt be in two places at once. I don‚Äôt operate into the night every time because we need rest to function well the next day. That narrows how many patients can be seen in office and can be operated on.

Add in charting which often happens at after hours/home. Add in patient messages and labs/results review which often happens after hours/home because its hard to do if I‚Äôm devoting my full time and attention to the patient in front of me and you have very little time.

We haven‚Äôt even addressed making time for family/kids/living life outside of constant work which is required not to burn out & quit which would just worsen the situation.

Specialists share the same problems primary care shares: not enough time/resources and unlimited patients needing care. This is a moral injury creating situation. This is a burnout creating situation.

I will always accommodate any clinician who reaches out directly. I will always accommodate a patient who reaches out directly in dire need either by literally walking into the office or reasonably escalating the chain. I will add telehealth visits after regular work hours to help patients who can‚Äôt make it during the day.

But my hands are also tied with limited time, limited attention, limited resources, limited leadership who care about patients rather than profit.

"I felt and understood what he was going through. However understanding doesn‚Äôt mean I will completely agree. But thanks to this conflict it really reaffirmed my own beliefs and strengthened my convictions which I know many others in the field would relate to.

Critiquing him, my initial prediction a few minutes into the video was that he was experiencing a burntout and midlife crisis (which turned out to be true when he admittedly used those buzzwords near the end of the video). I thought that he had a oversimplified and rather naively overoptimistic view of how things work. It was a tragedy from the start I thought since no one told him during his years in school how painful false expectations could be. He thought he could help people but was never told how not everyone could be saved. He thought he could end suffering but he never realized that fulfillment and suffering are two sides of the same coin. He didn‚Äôt realize how life worked I thought. I thought he‚Äôs just too good of a person, too kind of a soul for this cutthroat environment ‚Äî he didn‚Äôt realize enough to accept and adapt to how shitty the corporate world was. In the end, I felt sad that he felt that way and frustrated/angered by his hopeless fragility.

Good on him to make the change. Wish him the best of luck.

Lots of infectious diseases, a fair smattering of endrocrine and cardiology, partnerships with surgery, GI, pulm, IR, etc. The more I practice the more I also realize how much every specialty uses psychology at the core (you are dealing with and trying to motivate people going through major life trauma). You get into every little detail about their home life and home (who can drive you to appointments, how are you getting food, how many steps up to your bedroom?). You can develop very close relationships to patients and see them at their best and worst.

"Sure, whole bunch of citations but this is a small niche topic with only small studies, mostly observational.  I will tell you its basically standard of care for most neurologists to avoid them for headache.  Headache docs will rarely and sparingly use opiates, but they know what they are doing and combine a bunch of stuff at once with pretty customized protocols and most providers shouldn't be using any opiates for chronic headache.

1. [Opiate use for other indications induces chronic headache](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11264692/)
2. [Direct molecular role with opiates increasing CGRP receptor expression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5693217/), which is clinically proven with large trials to be one of the main mechanisms with migraine and chronic headache and treatments targeted against CGRP are clinically highly effective at reducing headache.  [Additional mechanisms may also be involved](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23144180/), but essentially well understood that opiates are 'particularly problematic' for development of MOH.
3. [Opiates are simply ineffective for acute migraine treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5711508/) compared to alternatives, clinical trial in the ED, [earlier observational data with the same findings](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17981511/).  Patients also had longer ED stays, required redosing or other medications much more frequently, and had inadequate relief.
4. [Additional observational data in a larger population](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4417651/) finding double the rate of ED returns and longer ED stays when opiates were used for acute primary headache (eg migraine) treatment.  [Second larger observational study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28645559/) with the same findings, and showing academic EDs used less opiates for headache and discharged patients faster as a result.
5. [EAN has a specific guideline ](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ene.14268)for medication overuse headache that is exactly what we do in the US as well. The IHS IHD3 is the standard diagnostic criteria for all primary headache syndromes that studies are based off of, so the definitions are all the same and well defined.
6. [Medication overuse headache is very, very treatable with good outcomes](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2766518).  It is a toxic cycle that patients find themselves in and counseling/hand holding is a huge part of getting out.  These headaches are generally bad enough that patients quit jobs and stop functioning.  Prescribing opiates are one of the routes into this mess, which is why the answer is no both acutely because they don't work, and chronically because they cause MOH.  Same thing for fioricet- if you are going to prescribe fioricet limit it to 9 tabs a month so they can't abuse it.  Triptans also need limits.

As for occipital nerve blocks, you could probably do 2 with a local neurologist and be competent at them.  They are very simple.  A 2hr course at a CME convention would also be sufficient.  I mention them because occipital neuralgia is very common with medication overuse headache and chronic migraine, and treating it can provide very quick and sometimes lasting relief for the rest of the headache pattern.  Credentialing might be complicated if you are a hospital owned practice.  It's a very low risk procedure.  Insurance often won't cover ONBs however, so a lot of people charge 50-200$ to do them and cover supply costs.  It's pretty magical doing one and having a patient go from 8/10 headache to 1/10 two minutes later.",r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZM2ZoZURKX1E4WUFzdTZsRGRYbUJGQlRqd21tLXoxZnk5TjZJM2ZEQ3huc3BHa1Bia0pzWEJUU3Y4RFlPd2s3bF91M1BoOUZHNGFQSmh4QWxMeTFzNUE9PQ==

"Great questions! And very common questions. I do recommend reaching out to a therapist to talk about these things.

So you gotta find a new purpose other than getting through to the next Big Thing. Therapy is super helpful for getting in touch with yourself to figure out what it is that really makes you tick.

I have realized that I don‚Äôt enjoy reading or writing code in the slightest, and I don‚Äôt think I would last very long in this industry because of this. 

For the past half year, I have been spending weekends volunteering at a local hospital and scribing, and I find this work to be much more engaging and fulfilling than anything I have done in the tech sector. I like working with and directly helping people, which I never get to do in tech. In the future, I would love to work in either primary care or academic medicine, where I get to help teach residents and medical students. I‚Äôd love a career where I can work well into my older years, not because I need the money, but because I love and see purpose in what I do. 

I am well aware that switching to medicine would have its downsides. This path is financially a huge opportunity cost for the next decade of my life, and medical school and residency are very tough. Luckily, I actually took many of the pre-medical courses requirements during undergrad, and I would need just one and a half semesters to wrap up all the other requirements in a DIY post-bacc program. If I work part time as a researcher during these semesters, I could take the courses tuition free. If I go to medical school in my home state (LCOL), I estimate that I would be able to pay for over half of the cost of attendance, thanks to saving a great deal of my income, as well as some lucky investments.

Am I insane for wanting to switch careers? Is there anything I haven‚Äôt thought through enough? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated from any medical students/professionals on this sub.",r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZdzF1em1aT0dSV0d2cnFYMWl3WHpqMUJhbUZ6a0hsTXFLcmx3TVhpRHQ3eHZVOG5CVVpXazdLRW80ZGc0SEdnRGxBd1kzejk2SEJvTkRkSE1fRW90ZVE9PQ==

"My father was a WWII vet (he was just shy of 56 when I was born).  From time to time, his shipmates would come to visit (I have to think his entire crew is gone now; he‚Äôd be turning 103 in a few weeks if he were still alive).

But it wasn‚Äôt until I finished residency that I really started to understand and appreciate the kind of bond they formed.  A lot of the psychology about friendships forged in foxholes applies to residency.  We all endured something horribly stressful together, and while nobody was shooting at us, we endured something that outsiders will never understand.  There‚Äôs also an intimacy that forms; I knew everyone‚Äôs coffee order, for example.  I knew if they snored.  I knew all sorts of things.  

It isn‚Äôt war, but there are similarities in the bonds we forge.

"resident in a pretty difficult clinic (underserved, very complex/difficult to deal with patients, minimal support staff, lots of patients do not have the portal or do not use it). The expectation is that if we ordered a test, we follow up on the results/let the patient know within two business days of the result (even normal results). I feel like that should be pretty standard practice. My personal practice has become two phone calls, if no answer they get a letter saying to call. If nothing happens at that point, it really is somewhat on the patient at that point.

"What are the chances that this CNM understands specificity and sensitivity? 

The only group of clinicians I've seen understand this consistently (as well as false negatives, positives, and pretest probability) is physicians.

And even then, there are still many physicians that do not understand it.

Very few tests have a 0% false negative rate, including the 1 hr glucose challenge test. https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/41/7/e111/36452/The-Sensitivity-and-Specificity-of-the-Glucose

Your patient has a ton of risk factors. To the point that even if the test is negative, you should take a moment question its validity.

Whenever the pretest probability is high enough, it is reasonable to go to more definitive testing. It's the same reason some patients with chest pain get stress testing, and some go straight to cardiac catheterization. If the suspicion that they have clinically significant, symptomatic coronary artery disease is sufficiently high, why should we putter around with provocative testing?

Your approach is perfectly reasonable here. I'm sure that in the future, you'll be able to educate them as to why you are right  üòâ

Exceptions to keep in mind: Definitve/diagnostic testing is not always covered by insurance if the screening test has not been done first (doubt this is relevant to 3 hr GTT) or the diagnostic test comes with significant risk (in which case a negative screening test should give you pause when it comes to pursuing the diagnostic test).

If you go directly to the diagnostic test and there is a complication, you open yourself up to liability. Thankfully, the 3 hr GTT does not come with any serious risk.",r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZdFFkcldvU0Q4VG9JSVBaQzVtbmR5VEVoY0dMRkt2U05QdUNyLVluUmhkckxlT0ZYTWVOWVpoSDVYdDJ6WHlwMDRNNEFTell5VGptYmh1QmpWV0w2NEE9PQ==

"I‚Äôm way late to this convo but hoping some of y‚Äôall are still active because I‚Äôm trying to figure out what‚Äôs going on now and I‚Äôm not seeing any of y‚Äôall talk about the underlying issues causing hypoglycemia here.

First - just sharing my experience. I had my first episode 5 years ago. I didn‚Äôt know what it was then but now that it‚Äôs happened to me several times and I‚Äôve started testing my blood sugar which dips to the 30s/40s - I know that was the first. Essentially I just get incredibly confused. I can‚Äôt think straight, disoriented and my skin gets numb. In some cases I‚Äôve had trouble seeing as well. It happens (mostly) when I‚Äôm exerting a lot of energy and miss meals (which I try to eat every 2 hours nowadays). I wake up at about 65-70 blood sugar. Coke pops me out of the fits.

Now I started going to the doctors to figure this out a year and a half ago. I feel like I‚Äôm finally getting somewhere but still no official diagnosis. My full blood panel - my diabetes test comes back low and my blood sugar usually at 70 which is fasting and at the start of the day. So I had a dr just say nothing was wrong with me prior and move me along. But the episodes are become more and more and very debilitating. So I went to a new dr and she actually had a friend who went through the same thing. Turns out her friend had a tumor on her pancreas. This tumor releases insulin which essentially lowers your blood sugar. I‚Äôm going back for a 2 hour test and I think after that a CT scan to look for tumors. I‚Äôve read another thing it could be is hypothyroidism but inevitably hypoglycemia is just a symptom of a root problem is what I‚Äôve been reading.

So my question for this group which it seems is experiencing the same episodes as me or connected to someone who is, is have you found your root problem? Have you been tested beyond blood panels? Have you been advised by your drs on what is causing this.

I‚Äôll be honest in that I‚Äôm freaking out. Removing a tumor on your pancreas is incredibly risky and often makes the patient become diabetic. At this point I‚Äôm essentially waiting on tests and drs appts to figure out what‚Äôs going on. And honestly you guys can probably relate in that most drs have no idea what to do with this kind of issue when you‚Äôre not diabetic.

So I‚Äôd love to hear anyone else‚Äôs experiences with drs and if anyone has been diagnosed to anything and been able to fix tha problem and essentially cure their hypoglycemia?

"That‚Äôs a pretty generous interpretation of those two links - the first is a single study looking at variations across races with blood glucose monitors and found a 0.33 difference- assuming that is true for all black patients is going too far (and I can‚Äôt find much with a quick pub med to add to it). The second is about hemoglobin variants that can affect the way the A1C assay is preformed and again, cannot be extrapolated to all black patients. Especially in a pregnant population where you likely have a hemoglobin electrophoresis.

If you can find me a paper that shows that black patients have better outcomes at higher A1C‚Äôs, I‚Äôll be on board.

"Fellow Hospitalist about 5 years out. Couple of personal takeaways that I have because the money aspect of everything unfortunately still messes with me at times.

-it‚Äôs like aftershocks from an earthquake. Meaning, it just takes time. I have less moments of panic and guilt now than I did a year ago, and less than two, etc. I think everyone‚Äôs timeline is different. 

- speaking on everyone being different, I unfortunately still compare myself to partners in my group. Came home and told my husband I didn‚Äôt think I was going ‚Äúenough‚Äù in terms of savings and work, etc. and he said to me ‚Äúcomparison is the thief of joy‚Äù which I know is an infamous quote but it applied! I was comparing myself to people in completely different situations and some practicing 10 years longer than me! So don‚Äôt let that stress you out.

-do what you are good at, what we are all good at and learn. I felt a lot better about financing when I started picking up some books and reading about it. I was fortunate and as a med student had an EM/IM tell me about the White Coat Investor. Quick and easy read that starts at the beginning of becoming a doctor and walks you though. It was written by a doctor so had some great tips but then additionally I just started picking up some more frequently recommended books and I think by having more knowledge, it made the whole situation easier. 

- going back to having partners in the group, I asked questions. Just like we cherry picked tips/tricks/traits through training, we can still do it. I saw a partner making what I thought was good decisions and something I liked, I just asked. There is no such thing as a dumb question. 

- ‚Äúlive like a resident‚Äù. I still will not turn down free stuff, I still look for the coupon codes online, I still try to maximize. And I think that‚Äôs some of that ‚Äúguilt‚Äù because I also still have some student loans. Will be done with my PLSF by 2025-26 and check back in with my mentality then but I also have learned to let myself enjoy life because that‚Äôs what I worked so hard for.

"I would probably talk to the patient and collaboratively decide whether to do the 3 hour GTT vs skip straight to assuming she is GDM and starting with QID sugar checks.  The chance of GDM is so very high in this case.  If the QID sugar checks are 100% in range after a week or two, can always stop.  But a ton of my prenatal patients are GDM/ preexisting diabetic. 

I often give patients with hx of GDM the option of starting with 1 hr gtt vs 3 hr gtt in 1st trim.  I explain the high chance of positive 1 hr gtt and let them decide.  And, if 1st trim 1hr gtt is pos but 3 hr is neg, they go straight to 3hr gtt between 24-28 weeks/ standard screening time.

"That‚Äôs‚Ä¶almost impressive how you got away with doing statistics in all of your tertiary education.

And as far as I know, my experience is not too unique in the Australian medical graduates sphere.

"Oooh okay since you‚Äôve mentioned the checking BG values for 1-2 weeks, how accurate for ruling out GDM is that truly?

Especially since peak insulin resistance is 28-32 +/- 2 weeks, how many patients with GDM are being missed by stopping BG checks after a week or two based on early good numbers?

Reason I ask is because I can‚Äôt count how many diagnosed GDM patients I have who start off great, then after 2-3 weeks end up requiring insulin despite good diet/physical activity. 

In my current practice if a patient declines 1 hour or 3 hour, we have them checking sugars for the remainder of the pregnancy because we haven‚Äôt truly shown that they do not have GDM. For those who show very good numbers in the first few weeks - we drop it down to twice a day. Patients don‚Äôt mind. 

But at my last practice we did the 1-2 weeks and if all fine, discontinue. 

But now I wonder how many we‚Äôve missed.

"Absolutely agree. Physicians are used to being high achievers and have always had a next challenge to tackle from high school and college admissions all the way to residency and boards. The feeling of finally reaching the pinnacle can feel like a ‚Äúthis is it?‚Äù realization. The paycheck
Is nice but it doesn‚Äôt mean you are automatically happy, that the stress melts away, that personal baggage disappears and that the work becomes easy. It‚Äôs fine, but not a magic cure for all the things we‚Äôve swept under the rug along the way and also why I don‚Äôt think of medicine as some kind of noble calling. 

The other factor is when we finish in our 30s is when most people‚Äôs life happiness curves start approaching their nadir before rising again, so it‚Äôs common for many to feel lost and behind. Our professional journey just magnifies it.

"> lifestyle changes in conservative management are by far the best way to treat low back pain and injury as opposed to surgery. However, **the system** as it exists now disincentivizes preventative medicine in favor of procedures (as we all know).

People are looking at the wrong system. I am a bariatric surgeon. I hope to high heaven that I never need bariatric surgery. I eat as healthy as possible - not perfect, but far better than most - so I never become overweight or obese. The **medical system** can do very, very little to deal with obesity other than medication or surgery. The **socioeconomic system** can do much more. Turns out that being highly educated and wealthy make you much less likely to be obese.

Preventative medicine isn't really medicine at all. It's eating habits, not smoking, not drinking much/at all, not using drugs, sleeping habits, wearing condoms, taking birth control, going to school, being born to the right parents, etc. Everything else is after the fact.

But once someone does have obesity with a BMI >45 or more, then there's a >90% chance that will never permanently improve without surgery.",r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaUjN0NmFCa200NkJiZmRXQTV0RWZtVGhHeWNhTmdDc21aNUNVNzhQR04wc1BnZ1RSWmJmdDZnc01hS3NtTkRSNDhfQlRseWg5dW4yVzF1Q0RyeUNsSmc9PQ==

"I'm PM&R and do a lot of chronic spine pain and work closely with surgeons and pain medicine. The problem with pain patients is a combination of patients being unable to implement lifestyle changes and our system not incentivising this type of care. As a side note it is also challenging to get long term data on lifestyle interventions in randomized controlled trials, especially as it pertains to pain. 

He has some points that are accurate but some things are a little too simple and appeal to layman more than other professionals.

An ideal setup for spine patients would be

-See me first to help triage the severity of the problem

-work with PM&R and PT, combining specific exercise, lifestyle medicine ( what he describes as diet, gen exercise, sleep, stress management, social connection,mental health, substance use), and psychological pain therapy.

-if problem is severe enough that spine isn't stable or nerve damage is bad, then see a surgeon

-if problem isn't that severe or patient needs an extra push, do pain injections to give them a boost. 

The problem with this is 

-many patients will not implement the suggestions I have seriously for a multitude of reasons. 

-many people see private surgeons first and get surgeries done quickly, making it harder to treat conservatively effectively

-many people are screwed by other parts of their life (work, insurance, etc) and can't address their problems appropriately. 

The medical system doesn't have the best incentives to accomplish the ideal setup in my view, but patients also do not have the best resources or motivation to do this. It's unfortunately a double whammy. I think most non surgeons try to do lifestyle interventions and have too many patients that can't do those things. It gets frustrating over time and you end up recommending things that are short term effective because you see so many people unable to make the lifestyle changes that will help them long term. 

I'm glad he figured this out, but it's not revolutionary. Nearly all of us in physiatry, pain medicine, and other conservative fields understand this. Many surgeons also understand this but they can only do so much. 

Chronic pain patients are very challenging and unfortunately many of us have to start limiting them in our practices because they take so much effort and don't implement the changes we want them to make. There needs to be a change to insurance and incentives to prioritize conservative care and give patients the resources they need. I'm not sure how we did the patient motivation end of things but unfortunately that is likely more a byproduct of our society and not the medical system.",r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTmpyVm8zdFh3LTdhRG5ZLW5YSUZBSS1XVFhib1Fwd3BEMC1rM3dvN2xTS3Bmd201d2NKYV9BZnlHRk9MQXVLRFMtVS1aNTRIanpSNHdzeXJJNFZOMkE9PQ==

"I think the separation between ""the socioeconomic system"" and ""healthcare system"" is not a clear cut as you imply. Many would argue these are so intertwined whatever division you make is arbitrary at best, and at worse so closely connected you can't separate them at all.

I will decline to voice an opinion on this other than to say I think anyone in frontline medicine would disagree with you that a patient's eating, drinking, and smoking habits are and should be outside of the purview of the healthcare system to address in at least some, even if limited, way.

Would you really not care if one of your patients tried to beat a hotdog eating contest the day after you did bariatric surgery?  Is that outside of your purview as a healthcare professional?

"I think the separation between ""the socioeconomic system"" and ""healthcare system"" is not a clear cut as you imply. Many would argue these are so intertwined whatever division you make is arbitrary at best, and at worse so closely connected you can't separate them at all.

I will decline to voice an opinion on this other than to say I think anyone in frontline medicine would disagree with you that a patient's eating, drinking, and smoking habits are and should be outside of the purview of the healthcare system to address in at least some, even if limited, way.

Would you really not care if one of your patients tried to beat a hotdog eating contest the day after you did bariatric surgery?  Is that outside of your purview as a healthcare professional?

"It is always interesting how different the program requirments are for similar majors at other schools. I get why it gets passed over at times but both in engineering and medicine it is problematic to not have that foundation. 

It has implications beyond just if you want to do a study or design an experiment. It is through research and statistics training that people learn things like how much type 1 and 2 errors can vary depending on test factors, what confounding variables to look out for when testing patients and what to do about them. New protocols that are put out are based on research studies and being able to go back to those studies is important to understanding when those protocols apply and their limitations. Unfortunately, this information isn't always packaged up nicely for clinicians.

Hopefully, statistics and research eduction requirements will change in the future.

"As a clinical analyst who specializes in surgery and surgical clinics (and has boots in the ground in surgery) while some neurosurgical pts obviously need surgery for intractable pain, we all know other pts seen by neurosurgeons have serious behavioral issues (that affect more than just an unhealthy lifestyle). Some are seekers and some are difficult to assess and handle due to altered brain chemistry from chronic narc use/pain pumps. This is Stressor #1. 

To the Suits/Stessor #2: From inception, admin begins their neurosurgical romance pitching unrealistic expectations and overly relates benefits/pay and surgical support when initially wooing the surgeon. I‚Äôve watched this repeatedly. But Admins goal is always to maintain their surgical specialties rounded out to keep more pts and revenue within their own system and to maintain their trauma level and will say pretty much anything to get a doc. This is the same with any surgeon. 

But when the neurosurgeon gets their block and starts cutting, it‚Äôs always the same. Admin begins to make noise, registering their *shock* about the costs of spine systems, allografts etc and they try to compare them to total joint systems. They register ‚Äúconcerns‚Äù about the clinic visits/revenue related to surgeries, unrealistically comparing neurosurgery blocks/surgeries per month vs ortho bros and ramp up the pressure. Then without notice advise that Supply Chain will no longer allow the surgeon to order specific spine systems (before a scheduled surgery) or graft anymore because supply chain has sourced lower-cost spine screws from X supplier, cages from another, allografts, fillers, putty from others as well. Except Spine doesn‚Äôt work that way. 

So with very little notice, the surgical schedule gets blown to crap because we have no purchase power for the pts‚Äô spinal systems for their surgeries. Cancellations and delays begin, and then the periop director and surgeon come to me for a detailed analysis tailored to fight  Corp off. And this happens every time a new Suit comes into the system, whether it‚Äôs a new person in Finance, Supply Chain, or higher up. It‚Äôs maddening. 

Combine all the above and sometimes the repetitive pressure breaks surgeons like Dr Goobie, who had mixed ambitions that were likely already compromised from inception. I do think he‚Äôs myopically focused on the ‚Äúhealthy lifestyle‚Äù cause but overall, his frank disenchantment and depression is logical *and* justified to me.

* ""I became a doctor to help people"" and ""your job as a doctor is to relieve suffering""
* He wanted to learn about consciousness and connecting brains to computers and cybernetics.
* He trained and learned about spine surgery as well (sounds like he didn't exactly love this part of his training)
* Turns out the dream of cybernetics is challenged by the body's immune response to the electrodes, which he perceived as an insurmountable obstacle to his research dream
* Talks about how much time/sacrifice it took to become a surgeon. Realized at 29 ""where I wanted to go was not possible"" and becomes disillusioned with his passion. Leans into spine, which he doesn't like. Gets paid well but doesn't like his job.
* ""I didn't know what the problem was but now I know what it is:"" in spite of wanting to help people, there were ""way more people that I couldn't help"" because of lifestyle/age/degenerative disease.
* Describes the spinal procedures as ""removing things"" (such as bulging discs or removing motion through fusion) with the exception of ""the only thing I added were these little electrodes to block pain signals"".
* ""What I realized later on is those aren't fixing the problem."" Surgery caused improvement but didn't address the cause of morbidity.

This is frustrating to watch. This guy is clearly bright but smacks of absolutely zero introspection, zero wisdom. It also screams **hubris**. Look, I'm sure he is a well intentioned guy and all but holy shit what kind of inflated sense of self worth must you have to think that you can somehow singlehandedly solve the problem of age and lifestyle-related spine disease? That, or naivet√©. It's a good lesson that even the brightest, most successful minds out there can still be goddamned fools.

My primary patient population is children who require ventilators to survive. These children have been afflicted by terrible conditions: prematurity resulting in profoundly immature lungs, neurodegenerative diseases, ischemic insults to the brain severe enough to rob them of their ability to breathe independently - sometimes due to abuse or trauma or other tragedy. We live amongst the tragedy as physicians. We work in spite of it. My patient with cystic fibrosis needing a lung transplant is looking at a severely reduced lifespan. My patient with a progressive fibrosing mediastinitis refractory to therapy is going to inevitably die, choked from the inside out.

I can't change the underlying reality of their diseases. I can't change the ""root cause"" of what they are going through. I don't even have the *luxury* of being able to blame years of poor lifestyle (though I know that it wouldn't serve to help me cope any better). But each day I meet with these families I have an opportunity to do **something** even if it's just walking beside them in their suffering. It's a goddamned honor that I'm invited into the room to help a mother decide when it's time for compassionate extubation and organ donation. To be entrusted with that knowledge and try and deliver it as compassionately, lovingly, and carefully as possible.

Did he completely miss the point of his professors wisdom? Because he can't seem to solve one problem?

Look, I get medicine is a goddamned mess. Insurance companies, medical device manufacturers, hospitals... hell 20% of the expense burden are literal administrative leeches sucking a paycheck out of the system while contributing nothing to the bedside. This is disillusioning . But is the solution really to fuck off to the woods and retire early?

Honestly, a week of really intensive therapy could have offered this man a great deal of relief. Or reading the wisdom of our forbears. Or even finding some philosophical framework (religion works, stoicism, existentialism) to help cope with the shit we all deal with and **still** get up to help patients. What a waste of thousands and thousands of hours of training. It makes me want to thank my PCP. I'm not the best patient but the things he's doing are literally saving my life even though they aren't as dramatic as cybernetic limbs. This guy pisses me off.

">It sounds like he should have been a rural family doctor instead of a neurosurgeon

Indeed. I truly empathize with anyone suffering from burnout, as he certainly is. But I can't help but see this video as a prototypical example of pathologic neurosurgeon ego. He goes on about how the medical system as a whole must be broken because his patients wouldn't require surgery if they changed their lifestyle.

Except AI will use all human knowledge in medicine to do it. More knowledge than 10 billion people collectively would have the capacity to hold and organize in their little heads. And if we play our cards right, the AI will stay updated on the latest and greatest discoveries and innovations. This is unlike most human doctors who get their diploma and go out doing what they do for 100 years in the same way, offering outdated treatments and... everything!

Yes something deeper is going on here. People are suffering, getting mutilated, dying, all day every day, from things that could have been avoided. And I'm talking strictly cases where shit has almost or already hit the fan and they went to a doctor for help, and they got nothing, or they got the opposite of help. You should go to a doctor and get help, not gaslighting and bullshit and stress and voodoo magic.

>I'd like to think physicians today are better than those 100 years ago. But ignoring the improvement of human physicians, if AI surpasses humans for accuracy and safety, we should adopt it. Not before.

>We're not going to sacrifice people on the alter of AI training. It's not ethical and reminds me of [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/720/)'s suggestion for a evolutionary algorithm cookbook.

Physicians today are better than those 100 years ago, no doubt. But not a lot of it translates to helping people, if you ask me. And even that doesn't hold true for a lot of them. A doctor graduated 30 years ago, and learned from books that are 60 years old, which hold knowledge that's 100 years old. Sure he picked up some shit along the way, but unless he tried, he's maybe not stuck in 100 years ago, but he's stuck in 50 years ago on many levels.

We should adopt AI right now. Make an app, charge people to use it, make people sign wavers and shit to be allowed to use it. Let people talk to a ""doctor"" for real, even if that doctor is not quite there yet. I promise you a lot of people are gonna have a long conversation with that AI that will get them somewhere. This is impossible with human doctors and their 7 minute appointments.

Also AI radiology for second opinions. Get an app or a website for that. Every person that ever got an xray, mri, ct scan, cbct scan, would like a second opinion on the report they received from the radiologist. And for good reason, as they make mistakes ALL THE FUCKING time. Yeah I know I know, people make mistakes, it's not always obvious. But you know what? Very often it is obvious, they just didn't look well enough, they didn't know to look for it, they didn't care to look more than a quick glance.

And now somebody is going with that report, which is wrong, to doctor after doctor. And every one of those doctors reads the report and operates under the assumption that the report is valid, and they run with it. And if the report is wrong, entire treatments and surgeries can be done because of it. Insane.

I read a comment on Youtube recently, and it may not be true, but the woman says she had an MRI of her spine and they found nothing. So she went to 2 doctors that read the report. Then she went to a third doctor and he looked at the actual images and told her she had broken her spine, or something to that extent. Assuming the third doctor was correct, and that the story is true, this is madness! It should never had happened. And you think this person can now go back and get some justice for this? I doubt it, doctors are protected like an endangered species. They're untouchable. License to steal, license to kill. And even if the person could get some justice, would they care? Who knows how much time has passed since the accident and the MRI, and it's very possible that now they can't solve the problem at all, but they could have solved it if it was diagnosed correctly the first time around.

We're not sacrificing anyone on the altar of AI training. Keep your shitty system with your human doctors, and put AI in the mix so that it can learn. Don't keep AI out of it and slow down its progression just so that you can appease the white coats or the pharmaceutical companies, or protect jobs or some nonsense.

"I watched the whole thing the other night.  It almost sounds like he came to doubt the utility of his interventions to such a degree that it stole his motivation.  But he also sounds like he pursued neurosurgery with sort of a pipe dream in terms of the brain-machine interface; maybe he was more of an academic or research-focused person who didn't find clinical work satisfying when that didn't pan out.  

I don't think it's any secret that the chronic diseases associated with modern lifestyles and the various comorbidities they result in are not problems that modern medicine can really solve and are kind of a drag to manage over the long term.  I think most people, however, can find satisfaction in the less frequent problem that we do solve or that does have true positive impact on a patient.  Neurosurgery is so cloistered and unfamiliar to me that it's hard for me to know if their outcomes really are inconsistent enough to make his perspective seem valid.

If he's just so much of a perfectionist that he couldn't be satisfied by work with the occasional imperfect outcome, then he really doesn't belong in healthcare and I think something else will bring him more peace of mind.  It is also likely possible to practice neurosurgery for a few years and save up enough to retire early with a modest lifestyle.  I don't think it will be possible to go back, however, if he takes any substantial time off, and I'm not sure neurosurgical training prepared him to use his medical degree in many other ways.

However, some stuff we do I believe still makes an impact, so I wouldn't go so far as quit my job over it. Maybe medicine specialties are different than neurosurgery, although I tend to think that surgical specialties make more apparent differences than IM.

"At what asymptomatic blood pressure, if any, should I consider it an emergency?  Sbp 220?  Dbp 150? Dbp 30?

"i'm a PCP and that's what i struggle with - if it's late in the afternoon how can I rule out evidence of acute renal injury from BP significantly elevated above baseline (eg the granny with CKD3a whose systolic runs 120s usually all of a sudden at 205 - *not* the guy who's been 175 systolic for the past 12 years)?   
  
I'm sure there is a rather small empirical probability of there being injury but at what point should I make the decision to send someone to ED? If my pre-test probability for end-organ injury is 1%? 3%? 10%?  25%? Etc. It's a numbers game: if we practice long enough and see enough patients, we have to accept there will be misses if we reduce sensitivity, and that's all well and good - there are costs/cons wherever I land on the spectrum and i don't know what the right answer is.  
 
i would LOVE some guidelines that exonerated me from sending eg the vignette of the granny in the first paragraph to the ED. sending to ED for r/o of end organ damage due to very high BP is exceptionally rare for me to do, like 1 in 3000 patient visits or so",r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaekpNX19PVHNqYTBsOVF5QnVURUR0V3JRNmFRN01VYVJCTVRNc0NMem94MFRmUlRsQTBQNUFRd2JRcEtNZl90WlVmdmlzejRrT0RXYWZkUU42VEJiQUE9PQ==

If you‚Äôre worried about AKI in an asymptomatic patient, they‚Äôre stable enough to wait a day for outpatient labs.  Even a weekend.

From UpToDate:‚óèIn one retrospective study of 59,535 patients who presented in the ambulatory setting with severe asymptomatic hypertension, there appeared to be no substantial benefit from emergency department referral compared with sending the patient home from the office for outpatient management of blood pressure [20]. At six months, rates of major cardiovascular events were similar and low in both groups (0.9 percent),

UpToDate recommends that these patients do not require ED referral.  This is in keeping with ACEP and other societal guidelines.

I have seen more than one patient have a stroke because their BP was lowered too rapidly in the setting of asymptomatic hypertensions. 

I would say that exceptions to the rule are: patients with significant CHF who may be at risk of developing flash pulmonary edema, and patients with known cerebral or aortic aneurysms.  However, even in these patients, I am unaware of any evidence conclusively demonstrating that these patients actually have lower mortality rates if they are referred to the ED.",r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaSFQ4U3hjTHlhazRRTUFzaV9uNUxqTXlTVjVsdFk3U3FNMDNBeDZKZHpBY1J2R3g5YXMzNjE3UVZtbG82Zm9HMnFoaXRZOTJmVW1qazUyMzJPTGgyUklrVHhRVmFxanUxSVBSMmJDVGt2QU09

Drug companies spend billions upon billions of dollars pioneering these novel compounds, because ultimately being the first one to find that magic silver bullet means they're the first one to functionally be able to charge whatever they want for it - and people will always pay.

"> While amusing, this anecdote is quickly becoming irrelevant. 

To be clear, this happened with one of the premier large language models two months ago. 

>Today, it is able to ace medical licensing exams

Large language models were actually able to do that last year. But that really speaks to how human-centered the test is. Just like being able to correctly identify all the road signs and laws is a pretty good indicator of whether a teenager is ready to get a driver's license, it is pretty disconnected from the ability of a computer to drive a car.

>perform specific functions much better than a physician. 

I don't think there's any argument here: for a given task, the question is who can do it better. When AI gets to be demonstrably better than a trained human at a task, we'll make the change. But that needs to be demonstrated, not hoped for.

There's an adage, Amara's law, that says we tend to overestimate the impact of technology in the short term and underestimate in the long term. We are still in the short term for LLMs and other AI tools. We have a lot of hope, and a lot of wild promises being made to attract more capital investment.

Just to clarify, I'm not knocking the individual doctors. They are doing their best with the tools available. It's the structure of society and medicine that leads to patients not receiving the help they need to make changes. 

A more just system would allow everyone access to therapists who could help them make changes using CBT, DBT narrative therapy, or whichever modality works for them.

" > How do you know that there aren‚Äôt plants out there more powerful than your pharmaceutical field can imagine,...

We don't. 

Which is why there is an entire branch of science devoted to natural drug discovery. These chemists, botanists, and pharmacists obtain and analyze natural products (microbes, plants, animals, fungi) for novel chemical compounds that can treat diseases. 

Once a promising candidate is discovered, other scientists take up the mantle and work to synthesize the compound or create related compounds that work even better. 

After the most efficacious molecules are discovered, yet more scientists begin testing in animal disease models, followed by human trials. 

If a promising compound makes it to human trials, yet more chemists and now engineers attempt to scale up the synthesis and make it economically feasible. 

If the compound succeeds in human trials and gains FDA approval, it is marketed for widespread use. 

This process is happening every day and we are cataloging and testing thousands upon thousands of such natural products every year. The general public isn't well aware of it because the entire process takes decades to go from a newly discovered natural product found in an Amazon flower to a widely available drug at the pharmacy.

">well-articulated, maybe overly tactful, and certainly long-winded

Yeah definitely not a good choice to make a point in 2024 where most people go through short clips like my cat through treats. He is presenting some issues that a **lot** of people who went to medical school didn't know about (somehow I sometimes awkwardly joke that I was missold medicine, where's my reimbursement) - and is doing so in an extremely polite and tactful manner.

I found that this clip really hits home. I matched for GP/FM when I finished med school and left my country after a year, disillusioned that I wasn't learning anything useful or modern. Did 10 years of basically any IM branch I could think of and at the end of it all I realised that GP/FM is what I really want to do at the end of the day - there's so much you can (try to) fix and (try to) change in primary care, especially in rural areas.

Sadly my 10 years apparently are not enough for me to take the specialty exam so I got hit with another 18 months of shit (literally, I worked at a much higher level than this, at the moment I'm a glorified pencil pusher, but such is training in my home country). But at the end of the day I met my fiancee and I found happiness and that is priceless. 18 months will go by like nothing at the end of the day, so there's that.

I would post this as a comment to this dude's clip because that would probably also make him happy. GP/FM in a rural setting is really satisfying and can yield immediate benefits to the patients (I had a ""trial"" of the job so to speak and I love it) and to your own mental health as a doctor who wants to actually have an impact (and a long term one!) on their patients instead of treating the 50th patient of the week with 2 day constipation on a Tuesday (or lower back pain, in his case).

>**In order to bill Medicare for two overlapping surgeries, the teaching surgeon must be present during the critical or key portions of both operations.** Therefore, the critical or key portions may not take place at the same time. When all of the key portions of the initial procedure have been completed, the teaching surgeon may begin to become involved in a second procedure. The teaching surgeon must personally document in the medical record that he/she was physically present during the critical or key portion(s) of both procedures. When a teaching physician is not present during non-critical or non-key 
portions of the procedure and is participating in another surgical procedure, **he/she must arrange for another qualified surgeon to immediately assist the resident in the other case**

"There's no clear cut way to ""expect"" elevated ICPs in such an emergent setting. If you suspect the patient has a severe head injury, any sort of space occupying lesion/blood, with a poor neurological examination, they probably have some element of ICP elevation. The clear cut findings are if they are unresponsive with a blown pupil, which also means they have herniated. 

BTG guidelines suggest sustained ICPs > 22-25 are detrimental. Hard to say at what ICP people start herniating, since it is individualized. 

Some places just have protocols in place for SBP control, which isn't really evidence-based, but is probably not unreasonable. Keeping SBP < 160 in an undifferentiated neurological emergency (especially trauma related) until you get imaging is probably not unreasonable. There is a difference in perfusion that happens when SBP is 140 vs SBP of 80. Maintaining a reasonable MAP is probably the best you can do. 

Ultimately, while we harp on BP control, if someone has a big subdural or epidural or trauma related parenchymal hemorrhage, the definitive life-saving measure is surgical decompression of some sort (EVD, crani, etc).

Long story short, from a prehospital standpoint, just aim for a reasonable BP and get the patient to the trauma center ASAP.",r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhVTViNXpUSDg1TEVqRWdyQU1aMG9yRFYzZ0cxajc2dWw5d2V6RUUwdThCa1V3UVJHVS1iQTZxVHRPOUotZW9GNG03V0hfMzkzWTFibFVUNENERjMxUFE9PQ==

You choose to have 2 kids instead of 4 because the expectations of what sort of lifestyle you provide for yourself and your children is much higher than it was in the 70s.

"Many of my colleagues believe that no amount of arthritic pain is enough to require opiates. That amount of opiate for knee arthritis is just simply too high for any individual.  Opiates have not been shown to be effective for this indication.  If this person has surgery  on preop short acting opiate at that level, they not tolerate it well at all, even with a multimodal regimen. These patients are usually people who expect a 0 pain level at all times, which makes it more difficult. 

Essentially this is a person who is addicted to short acting opiates, which makes them a terrible candidate for a painful elective surgery. Instead of telling the patient the appropriate thing which is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel safe operating on you while you have an opiate addiction‚Äù he challenges the patient to stop and prove that they can remain opiate free.  This is the most charitable explanation.  

The reality is that for someone who is busy and does elective surgery they can just say no to patients who aren‚Äôt worth the time and effort. This is a patient who is very likely to have a bad experience with this operation, who has a high risk of postoperative opiate dependency and poor pain tolerance.  For many of these patients every visit is a negotiation on the number of pills they need.  Many pain management folks and PCPs won‚Äôt prescribe postoperative either. The ever shrinking amount that gets paid for a total joint is just not worth it for some people. If the patient ODs, everyone points to the surgeon and they will 100% get named in the suit.  That risk is just not worth it to some. 

If they are in a bundle, then they are at risk to use emergency services and rehab which will come directly out of the surgeons pocket. This is a major problem with alternative payment models like bundle payments, they exclude patients from elective operations that they would otherwise be candidates for.  

Maybe they just don‚Äôt like them or just generally don‚Äôt hate taking care of patients on chronic opiates. I don‚Äôt know the guy. Ultimately if the patient wants surgery they should just find someone else, there‚Äôs no shortage of surgeons who do arthroplasty, at least not yet.",r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnZ3doTDVoM1lSWEJqM2ttclc4MUk5SXA5b3VZZEdyMUNMdlpoVkx2b3VzblE3MnllRWt1ZndhZlpiNGowRDF3Y3FkaU5uQUVoQzI2WXBzbWZOelQ4M3c9PQ==
"I cannot speak for hip arthroplasty data, but I can comment on spine surgery data. Patients who are opioid tolerant before surgery do worse compared to patients who are opioid naive for many elective spine surgery conditions. Preoperative optimization is a huge deal in spine surgery. Chronic opioid users not only can be very difficult to manage postoperatively, but they are at significantly higher risk for medical complications. 

If you are going through 90+OME per day, you are at substantially increased risk for complications. You can imagine horrible postoperative pain control from ripping your back open.. leading to not mobilizing out of bed.. leading to DVTs, bed sores, UTIs, SSIs, etc. If you need the surgery, you need the surgery. But if it is purely elective, there is absolutely a role for pre-op optimization of opioid use.

From a recent review, Yerneni, Neurosurgery 2020:   
""Preoperative opioid use is overwhelmingly associated with negative surgical and functional outcomes, including postoperative opioid use, hospitalization duration, healthcare costs, risk of surgical revision, and several other negative outcomes.""",r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnOHBUT3pVYUdXRnN4bXZmNkZqOXdtVUUycU1pMVJBWXE5RHFWbk44b0xsRVFveFVBYmxvcVVYaks4dmxtV052d2NoNDhKWWgtaGFOZzFVQS1ObHRwWmVGTUREQVo5X0twTWE3b2hYcVBjYkk9

"Lots of local/regional ""non profit"" systems that happen to be Catholic refuse to provide any type of birth control, barring serious/extreme need.

So if you're in a rural area that only has access to one of those systems, well, good luck on the birth control.

""A significant proportion of the US healthcare market is controlled by Catholic healthcare systems, which use moral teachings to inform guidelines to care. Many patients do not realize that their healthcare choices will be affected by attendance at a Catholic institution, in part because such facilities do little to inform patients of restrictions to common reproductive services including LARC.""

A quote from the article

""Our results indicate that the short-term use of opioids (e.g.: to deal with an acute pain crisis from arthritis) will not increase the risk for future surgical complications, whereas continued use significantly increases this risk. Furthermore, it also suggests that once a patient requires the use of opioids to manage an acute crisis of arthritic pain that they would benefit from surgical consultation, if only to discuss the option of surgery. Finally, these results also suggest that a harm reduction strategy‚Äîi.e. encouraging cessation or perhaps even a reduction of opioid use to ‚Äòintermittent‚Äô levels should be attempted prior to surgery. However, this will require further study.""",r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNncVloeHVVcVNQcUdSQ2M5bGRCdVcxLXVEQ3FYRVQ2bGJaT2YwaW5tYVp0RFFsZXJoUGdzNEQteXVaMzFGTG1PVHJ6T1g1Z2RfaE5ycTU5d3VnTi1NRWc9PQ==
