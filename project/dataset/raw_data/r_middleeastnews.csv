Brazil - human trafficking, rape, murder drugs
South Africa - land expropriation and other anti-white racist BEE policies

">Earlier this year, one of Washington’s preeminent think tanks, the Atlantic Council, was caught in a pay-for-play scheme promoting an authoritarian regime that happens to pay some of its bills. The incident could reignite a burgeoning bipartisan coalition of anti-kleptocracy lawmakers that has put foreign corruption in its crosshairs.  
The president of the Council, Fred Kempe, penned a glowing op-ed at CNBC.com on January 14 applauding the United Arab Emirates’ appointment of Sultan Al Jaber, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company’s CEO, to lead the U.N.’s COP28 climate summit. The article dropped in the midst of a backlash from climate activists who oppose the selection of an oil chief from a petrostate to head international climate talks. What the article didn’t disclose in its original version was that the Atlantic Council has received over $1 million in donations annually from the UAE for the past five years, along with gifts from various state-connected entities.
