"> How about WWII and the pacific campaign 


How about it? Your understanding of history is wrong if you think the Army wasn’t conducting major operations or contested landings in the pacific. 

The Army outnumbered the Marines 21 Divisions to 6 Divisions. The Army landed and fought alongside the Marines at Guadalcanal, Peleliu, Okinawa, Saipan, Kwajalein, Eniwetok, and Iwo Jima. The army was at Bougainville, the multitudes of landings and battles fought in the Solomons, New Guinea, and the Phillippines. Short of Tarawa, Guam, and Tinian I can’t think of any other Marine landing the Army also didn’t fight in.

The Army under MacArthur in the Philippines and New Guinea took more land, conducted more amphibious landings, and killed more IJA than the Marines did in the entire war. In New Guinea alone, the Army killed, captured, or stranded over a quarter of a million Japanese troops during the campaign.

The Marines conducted 15 significant landings in the entire war; one army group conducted 35 in the Philippines alone.

One NG Division, the 32nd, spent almost as many days in combat (650) as the entire six USMC  Divisions combined (725).

The Army did the entire China-Burma-India campaign; the entire Southwest Pacific campaign; sole operations in the Aleutians, Makin & Kwajalein; and had a division or larger troop concentrations at Guadalcanal, Bougainville, Guam, Eniwetok, Peleliu, and Saipan; plus the overwhelming majority of the force on Okinawa.",r/military,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZajFoVWxISEtuVkRPWlZNbGFWdDktdHkzUHN3LWJPSjJBdnhfWEdkc05GcGhxOG9wR3FVcGxzZzJweWhMR25XVXp2ZTVDMnZjTVFkaXBYNEtGVmYzZkE9PQ==

"Coast Guard:

Cutter life is like the Navy if it was actually cool. Off once major scheduled tasks are done, so while you will have late days sometimes, you’re usually off between 14-1530-ish. Your time is your own. Once we change out of uniform, the CG is much more culturally anal about “leave people the fuck alone”. Since we don’t have large bases, with cutters, unless you’re on the boat all the time as a non-rate, you won’t run into people all that much if you really don’t want to. 

Station life is like being at a fire station. That’s the best way to describe it. 2 on where are you sleeping and living at the station, 2 off where you are home. If you’re lucky and smart about it, you can schedule leave around your duty section, to where, using only a couple days leave, you get almost entire weeks. You start with your 2 days off, apply for leave for the next two, then you have another two, and if command approves it which they sometimes do, voila, 6 days off. You are more likely to get harrassed on your off days at a station.

Cutter portcalls can be somewhat restrictive and dumb to absolute anarchy. It’s a box of chocolates. And it depends on a lot of variables which would take some time to explain. Don’t be the one getting caught and restricting everyone else to the boat. Good way to have valuables get float tested.

">Prime Minister Donald Tusk has claimed that Tomasz Szatkowski, who served Poland’s ambassador to NATO until this year, was suspected by the intelligence services of various offences, including improper handling of classified documents, contact with foreign security services, and obtaining unauthorised financial benefits.

>The claims come after Tusk’s government moved earlier this year to remove Szatkowski – who was appointed under the former Law and Justice (PiS) government – from his position. Those efforts were resisted by PiS-aligned President Andrzej Duda.

>Szatkowski yesterday rejected Tusk’s claims against him as “obviously untrue” and has threatened to sue the prime minister. Duda has also continued to back Szatkowski, whom he appointed as a presidential advisor earlier this month.

>

>Tusk outlined the allegations against Szatkowski during a speech in parliament on Friday. He said that the Military Counterintelligence Service (SKW) had expressed a number of suspicions regarding Szatkowski as far back as 2019, when he was nominated as ambassador.

>“According to the findings of the SKW, Szatkowski was accused of improper handling of classified documents, contacts with foreign secret services, obtaining unauthorised financial benefits, as well as relying on suggestions and inspirations from foreign companies when drawing up important state documents directly relating to state security,” said Tusk.

>The prime minister added that the SKW had not informed the Internal Security Agency (ABW), which is in charge of granting security clearances, about these findings

>If the ABW had received the SKW investigation results, it would have had to initiate an investigation and Szatkowski would then have lost his security clearance and the ability to serve as ambassador. Instead, the ABW, unaware of the allegations, issued Szatkowski with security clearance in 2019 and 2022.",r/military,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZenlKaTFOby1hTFJ5YURjV2VqemJLelA0YUlCNTNXaGZzSk9fQjNkazFZNWJZNGp0eEpKMXJEYnBKR2ZmcExobTZMV2lHbXpPSDdfbHVSZVU3R2pkTXc9PQ==
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_unit

Armed Forces need to organize their structure before a crisis, just like police forces or firefighters or kitchen brigades. Because when the war happens, the guests arrive or a city burns it is a bit too late to start from scratch with *""how to we organize and command everything""*. And just like at school humans tend to organize large groups of human (children and soldiers) into group where it makes sense. And just like in school the bigger the school you want to have different classes and different teachers in order to better organize everything. 

And yes, every military branch has their own formation, philosophy and tradition on how things should run. Sometimes it makes sense (a tank unit on the ground is something different than an aircraft carrier), sometimes it is tradition and sometimes military organization and differences are nonsense.

">Tusk said that both he and Duda had been informed of these concerns at the beginning of May this year, which was when the government tried to recall Szatkowski from his position.

>However, Duda [refused to sign off on the appointment of the government-nominated candidate](https://notesfrompoland.com/2024/05/23/president-rejects-governments-move-to-replace-polands-nato-ambassador/), Jacek Najder, accusing Tusk’s cabinet of violating procedures and endangering Poland’s preparation for a NATO summit that was held this week in Washington.

>Initially, the government did not communicate why it had sought to dismiss Szatkowski. Yesterday, Tusk said that he was now revealing the details because the NATO summit had finished.

>Tusk called on Duda and the former PiS authorities to explain why, despite such concerns about Szatkowski, they had continued to allow him to serve and had publicly defended him. Before being appointed ambassador to NATO in 2019, Szatkowski served for four years as a deputy defence minister in the PiS government.

>

>After Tusk’s announced yesterday, Duda told broadcaster Polsat that he had doubts as to “whether the prime minister was telling the truth”.

>“I expect this matter to be cleared up. So far it is one big set of slanders for me. This case is really very strange,” added the president. “Szatkowski remains my advisor.”

>Szatkowski himself also issued a statement to the Polish Press Agency (PAP) in which he rejected the “false and manipulated accusations” and announced plans to sue the prime minister for his “slanders”.

>“Tusk’s accusations are based on the content of anonymous denunciations and other manipulated information, which have been verified as untrue by the SKW at my request,” wrote Szatkowski, who is also suing newspaper *Gazeta Wyborcza* for its reports claiming he failed a polygraph test.

>

>Meanwhile, on Friday, Tomaszk Siemoniak, who serves as interior minister and coordinator of the security services, confirmed that Szatkowski’s access to classified information has been suspended following a decision by the ABW to launch an investigation into him.

>“The examination of this case has been ongoing since last Wednesday,” said Siemoniak, quoted by state broadcaster TVP. “This is a proceeding that automatically suspends access to classified information.”",r/military,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZSlhKQjRBWmhUZmJhZE1zZXh4NmZBZHgtQ1BPZ0tfVWZOa1hOMDhzVHpod1NDdkVWaGVVaDVJeWRVeEVUSEw1cUpuaVRqNVQ1OHZTRzkycFhYc0k2aUE9PQ==

"The Defence Secretary has said the UK is committed to a shared plan with the US and Australia to create a new fleet of nuclear-powered submarines.

John Healey said the Aukus defence project was a ""fundamental"" part of the UK's future security, which would fuel economic growth.

He spoke as he toured a military steel supplier in Sheffield with Richard Marles, the Australian defence minister and deputy prime minister.

The submarine programme is expected to generate 7,000 additional British jobs.

Mr Healey, fresh from the Nato summit in Washington DC, visited Sheffield Forgemasters, which is owned by the Ministry of Defence, alongside his Australian counterpart.

He reaffirmed the UK's commitment to Aukus and emphasised its role in job creation.

Mr Healey said: ""Working with allies and partners is fundamental to our security and so it is a pleasure to host my Australian counterpart within my first fortnight as defence secretary.

""The UK and Australia are the closest of friends and our work through Aukus is testament to this.""

The MP for Rawmarsh and Conisbrough, in South Yorkshire, added: ""Sheffield Forgemasters is a shining light of UK industry that helps boost global security and employs skilled staff from the local community.

""This is just one example of how our hugely important partnership with our Australian and American partners can help drive jobs and growth across Britain.""

The visit comes after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer spoke to his Australian counterpart, Anthony Albanese, with the leaders outlining their commitment to partnership.

Mr Marles has also visited HMNB Clyde, in Scotland, to see first-hand how the UK operates its nuclear submarine base.

British design
The Aukus submarines are aimed at countering China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

They would be able to operate further and faster than Australia's existing diesel-engine fleet, with the country capable of carrying out long-range strikes against enemies for the first time.

Under the deal, sailors from the Royal Australian Navy are due to be sent to US and UK submarine bases to learn how to use the nuclear-powered submarines.

From 2027, the US and UK will also base a small number of nuclear submarines in Perth, Western Australia.

Canberra is set to buy three US-model Virginia-class submarines in the early 2030s, with an option to purchase two more.

After that, the plan is to design and build an entirely new nuclear-powered submarine for the UK and Australian navies, which is known as SSN-AUKUS.

The craft would be built in Britain and Australia to a British design, using technology from all three countries.",r/military,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZa29zTUtQcGlhVXlFVkJudHhhTVhUcEEzOUFNaWViUHJRb0lUaWtjdVBZNzFaRURrYkkyWVVGbFI4WTFESFREMWN3RTRtTnNuc3VOVjZjWVZNd2NXT0E9PQ==

"Note: this is for the Army. 

The smallest unit is a team, typically consisting of four Soldiers. It is led by a Team Leader, typically a Sergeant (E-5)

The next unit is a squad, consisting of eight to ten Soldiers (two teams). It is led by a Squad Leader, typically a Staff Sergeant (E-6). 

The next unit is a platoon, consisting of four squads (about forty Soldiers). It has a Platoon Sergeant (typically a Sergeant First Class, E-7) and a Platoon Leader (typically a Second Lieutenant, O-1). 

The next unit is a company, consisting of three to five platoons, usually four. It is led by a First Sergeant (E-8) and a Captain (O-3). You may notice that First Lieutenants (O-2) do not normally have a command; they serve as staff officers. A cavalry company is called a ""troop"" and an artillery company is called a ""battery.""

Next is a battalion, three to five companies. It is led by a Lieutenant Colonel (O-5) and a Command Sergeant Major (E-9). All units from this point forward have a CSM. As with 1LTs, Majors (O-4) are usually staff officers. The cavalry call this unit a ""squadron.""

Are there still parts of the Marines that execute combat related things? Do you believe the Marines is the place to go accomplish this SoF goal of mine?

Additionally, many Marines shoot with replicable errors. This means that they’re doing something wrong, but consistently wrong. This produces consistent results, so it isn’t necessarily a problem.

"Canadian Airborne Recon Patrol Pathfinder. 

If you wanted to find out how tough, strong and resilient that you are.

80% failure and the candidates are already some of the toughest people on the planet.

The toughest and smartest, of the toughest and smartest are the few who graduate.

What does it do for you? Well, career advancement and the respect of your peers most certainly. Also getting really hard jobs from then on out. Really hard jobs, because, well you know, you are tough. It says so in your military records. You are an airborne pathfinder with a life expectancy of almost zero once deployed in your role.

Then in later life you get the inability to walk up, or down stairs. Also sometimes your hands will drop things and your brain will freeze up as you fall over for no discernible reason. Drooling on the front of your shirt is an added bonus after retirement that your loved ones can enjoy at family gatherings with weird ol uncle. He cant hear you anyway so say what you want. But hell Ya! For a moment you where the toughest guy on the planet. Ready for the big show.

Today in the Canadian military you can do this course without the prerequisite of basic para and freefall para. Most people that I know would fail out in these two prerequisite objectives.  However the intent of the program was initially designed to provide small teams of highly trained personnel who jump into a location unannounced, (sneaky) recon the situation, (again sneaky) radio back to the main airborne assault force, set up the drop zones and then guide them into the fight. In WW2 Europe there was a 95% death rate/failure expected and realized for Airborne Pathfinders.

As there is no need for any mass para operations in modern warfare (doctrine) these skills (para/freefall) are not part of the pathfinder program any more. Helicopter deployments are now all the rage and reduce the amount of casualties that may smack into the ground and die, can carry more equipment, and have a larger force to actually fight with. It is a lot noisier though.

In summary: There are few, if any people from your neighborhood who could get anywhere near successfully completing this training.

"Navy Nuke school really sucked.

3-4 subjects being taught at once with a exam every week. That's a tough course load but what makes it worse is that the entire syllabus is NOFORN/Confidential/Secret so you can only study in the building and can't take anything home with you.

The tests usually cover about 40-60 pages of notes and much of it is based on rote memorization. The Navy does not want you to solve problems creatively. They want it done EXACTLY as taught. Most of the points are not in the correct answer, they want to see the exact process used to solve the problems as shown in class.

The Navy will also ""award"" you mandatory study hours if you're acing their exams. I remember people being on +20s (20 extra hours per week after normal business hours, which were 0800 to 1800 every day). Guys were basically pulling 12s all day every day including the weekends just to keep their heads above water.

Then you hit prototype and it's basically that plus learning how to stand watch on the plant. I remember the midphase test was about 80 pages ALL ESSAY and the comprehensive final was like 130 pages ALL ESSAY. They recommended writing breaks during test day to keep your hand from burning out. Then you have to meet a oral board of 4 instructors and convince them you know enough to pass the program AFTER all that stuff.

I don't know how I made it through but I'm 100% sure it was only because I was in my early 20's and had no family or social life. I don't think I would make it past the first month if I had to do it again.",r/military,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMTZNRGNCeDZOTXdWUTZvVm0yS1RNT3VvTEZQMGwwRk9JUDlXd0c3Q1VPR3hLSDBWelNiZDVfQnk0ZVFCQ2MxaVpaQ3dBcUhjNVJBME0tdVF4VHFPQXc9PQ==

When my enlistment expired, I went onto a different career.

"It depends on the language. I went for Chinese. One basic concept they they repeat often is that 3,000 words is enough to understand 90% of conversational Chinese. And 5,000 words only takes you to like 92%. So they emphasize learning the 3,000 most common words over your 63 weeks of class. That comes out to 47 words per week. But, you also have to learn grammar, syntax, and in Chinese you learn hundreds of idiomatic expressions based on ancient folktales. Plus, there’s also essentially an alphabet inside each Chinese character. 

As to OPs question, the difficulty of graduating from DLI fluctuates as the curriculum catches up to the test, but when I was at DLI, the most failures I saw in a class was 90%. It’s typically around 33% to 50%. The thing that linguistic school doesn’t have that BUDS does is medical disqualifications.

But, if you were like me, and your life had no direction, and you didn't know what to do, then yeah, the military is pretty good and will give you purpose. The only additional advice I would give you is don't join to be a welder. You are already a welder. Do something that is out of your skill set, like try for finance or aircraft mechanic. If you go as a welder, they will make you do welder school all over again, and you will have to work your way up again. Learn a new skill that will be able to augment or make a great backup plan. You can always cross train back into welding if you want, but I would 100% say try a new career field.

"Taiwan hopes to receive all 66 of its on-order Lockheed Martin F-16Vs by the end of 2026.

The country’s defence ministry says that technical issues related to the aircraft have been resolved, according to a report by the national Central News Agency.

The ministry provided an update on deliveries in a letter to a legislator, who had queried it about the F-16V acquisition and other weapons.

If the ministry is correct, it suggests that deliveries are reverting to the original plan, which called for them to be completed by 2025-2026.

In May 2023, then defence minister Chiu Kuo-cheng said that deliveries had slipped to the 2026-2027 timeframe. At that time, Chiu attributed the delays to supply chain issues stemming from the coronavirus pandemic.

In addition, the Ministry of National Defence says that software integration issues around equipment specific to Taiwan also contributed to delays. Taiwan, which had wanted to order new aircraft for years, was finally able to order the F-16Vs in 2019.

The delays have caused some political consternation in the USA among lawmakers concerned about China’s massive arms build-up and increasingly aggressive posture.

In November 2023, Rob Wittman, vice-chairman of the armed services committee, and several colleagues sent a letter to US Air Force secretary Frank Kendall asking about the delays.

The group noted that completion of an upgrade programme for older Taiwanese F-16s to the F-16V standard was delayed by up to three years owing to a lack of key parts – in February, Taiwanese aerospace firm AIDC confirmed that the upgrade programme for 139 F-16Vs had been completed in late 2023.

Further, the letter contended that the 66 new jets had been delayed owing to “software complexities” that Lockheed failed to anticipate.

You correctly but misleadingly pointing to the fact that there are *temporary* exceptions for people in very specific circumstances, which doesn't change the fact that they are still required to register once those circumstances no longer apply to them.

"USAF SERE instructor might be up your alley. I wouldn’t recommend the military to most people, but it might be a good decision for you. Free college is nice, but if you decide to go back to school later in life you’re going to be years behind your peers in whatever future career you choose; granted, that’s not usually a big deal for most careers. From personal experience, I can say that my life now would be significantly less stressed had I just gone to college after high school and pursued the career I’m interested in. Now I’m married, have a toddler, work part time on top of school to pay bills, etc.. it’s still plenty doable but definitely more stressful compared to what could have been. However, YMMV with school after the military. I would say a good portion of my friends who got out and attended school are having a pretty cush experience. If you’re interested in a job that satisfies you, you’re probably going to be let down from most military jobs. Even the “fun” jobs can be disappointing once you see what’s behind the curtain. I did air rescue for the navy, and all but two people of my graduating class of 15 ended up getting out after their first tour. I can’t speak for other communities, but it seems like most of the dudes I’ve come across navy-wise (SEAL, EOD, Diver) seem to share that same sentiment. If you join, you’ll meet plenty of amazing people and will probably get to have some unique experiences, but it all comes at a price. That all being said, I still had a good time and made some amazing friends who I will stay in touch with until I croak; that alone was worth it to me.",r/military,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNabEdRdUJCaWpxRUlzN2Y5TGtBaHZ0Z0J0LVg4TGRKN0ZKWTB4VGRwYnNtOG1DRmlMaXd1ZnZ4SkhhM1hwTHVpODR0QjJkR0FhYlVTVTluQkE0S21pUlE9PQ==

"To answer your title, yes, it is possible to join directly as an Officer.

To clarify your remarks about what you're cousin told you, E-5 is an enlisted rank. Officer ranks all start with O. I believe your cousin was referring to the fact that you would most likely receive E-5 pay while at Officer Candidate School (or your chosen branch's equivalent). Once you complete said school, you receive a commission as an O-1 on active duty (either a Second Lieutenant or an Ensign, again depending on branch). This may differ if you decide to join the Medical Corps; I believe they base your rank on your specialty and your experience, but if you're just starting out, I imagine they'd still start you at a relatively low Officer rank.

They may or may not care about what degree you have, depending on which career path you want to take. There are several options where your degree does not matter, though your GPA from getting that degree still plays a large role. Naval Aviation is such an example; many Pilots and Flight Officers have degrees completely unrelated to their career (jokingly referred to as ""degrees in underwater basket weaving""). For that pipeline, they evaluate your GPA and ASTB-E performance instead of your degree choice. There are other requirements involved however, such as minimum age.

What your cousin told you is mostly true, but while I can't speak to all branches or professions, a common theme I've seen is that while the pay is good, it's usually better in the civilian field for the equivalent job, more so than the tax benefits can account for. You can also usually expect to move every couple of years, with some exceptions (dual-mil couple, or a dependant that requires exceptional medical care). And depending on your branch and career path, you may also expect regular deployments/detachments from your home station, including increased working hours for a relatively small bump in pay.

It's hard to speak to all the downsides, because they're all going to be different based on which branch you pick and which career path within that branch. But remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.",r/military,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhT25vMGtpVExDU1Z4X3oyZUVUN1c0aDlSSXBtTEJfVFhkRWxfdTN5OWJqZnQydnY4X2QxRkJGNHZrMVhTNTdGVG9SV0k4aGN0emRNRmFoeENNWlZiWEE9PQ==

"E5 is enlisted.  To be eligible for a  regular commission, you need a 4 year degree in hand.  Depending on branch and career path, other requirements could include a STEM degree, 3.5 or better GPA, excellent scores o the Officer version of the ASVAB.

Psychologists require a Masters at minimum, preferably with experience treating patients for at least a year.  They earn a Direct Commission, usually as an O2( more experience means possibly coming in as an O3 or better.  Know of a guy with 20 years experience who came in as an O5).

"> I really do think suicide prevention is a big issue

I don't even know what it means, anymore.  We used to get marched in once a year so the chaplain could stand up front and tell us not to kill ourselves.  Was that supposed to accomplish something?  Are they doing something better, these days?  As far as I can tell, there's nothing for people once they get out, either.

Sorry, I'm not trying to sound cynical.  I just read this stuff all the time about suicide awareness and suicide prevention, but as far as I can tell we still don't have a real firm idea why some people are pushed over edge, or why no one recognized the signs, or what they should have done differently.

Too many factors to say yes to this. I was a truck driver but none of my licenses were any good outside of the Army so I would have had to go to truck driving school anyway. Some jobs transfer well like Intel or some IT jobs (not all).

"They do nothing of tangible value. “Suicide prevention/awareness” training is not meant to stop people from killing themselves, but rather to make people aware of some of the signs that someone is going to kill themselves, and how to interrupt the behavior and/or inform the right people who are more equipped to intervene.

The effect of this is that leadership (command level through to the SECDEF) is delegating preventing suicides to the bottom rung of the ladder, so that when suicide rates don’t go down, it isn’t the DoD’s fault, it’s the fault of the victim’s friends and colleagues who didn’t do the job that was assigned to them. I have legit seen a CPO yell at and berate their division for not stopping one of their own from killing themself.

The DoD as an institution only cares as much about troop suicide as much as it cares about troop pregnancy or injury: it’s just another gapped billet that they need to fill. It cares about veteran suicide even less. This isn’t to say individual people in the DoD don’t care, they certainly do.

"Yes, if you have a college degree you meet the minimum requirement to *apply* for an officer program.

Be advised applying for officer isn’t anywhere near as quick as enlisting, even if you’re accepted, expect an 8-12 month process from the first interview to shipping to OCS. For Air Force it’s closer to two years, and AF heavily favors STEM degrees and high GPAs. Other branches are relatively more accepting of other majors and slightly lower GPAs.

My suggestion would be that you read up on officer programs for several branches, and make appointments to meet with recruiters. Note for Army and Coast Guard, the same office does enlistment and commissioning. However for Navy, Marines, Air Force they have totally separate *officer* recruiters and there is zero utility to meeting with an enlistment recruiter if your goal is to commission.

Note too Army is unique in that you have to enlist to commission, and go to enlisted Basic training prior to being given your shot at OCS.

Or as noted above, you could enlist which is far quicker and easier and gives you direct control over what job you get, and with a college degree you’d come in at a higher enlisted rank.",r/military,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnT1BNS1JsY3VERkJNcE14Uk93NFhWWkMwSENiUThTM2h4c2toN05mZ0podkRYZkVhNEt0bE5iaURtRDVMS1BWMVpLNHBDWm5zMVVmeFo3NUtvM3BGWkhfV3BsRVQyQlAyazk4aml1V21FbGs9

"Which involves both money and reelection.

Ask yourself, why has cutting spending on veterans always been so unpopular? If it was only veterans representing themselves at the polls then we’d pretty much have nothing. It’s overwhelmingly a matter of public opinion across many different voting brackets.

Given that, over the past couple of years, it’s become clear that it’s stupidly easy and cheap to sway a given person on a subject by simply just gaslighting them with an overwhelming majority of false information rather than clear factual arguments. I don’t see it as completely out of the realm of possibility that veterans benefits will be attacked one day with public backing. It may not (and probably won’t) happen if Trump wins but it’d potentially be a green light to push the envelope further given him and his party’s association with the Heritage Foundation.

Admittedly, the gutting of VA benefits falls under a large umbrella of terrible shit Project 2025 proposes. And pretty much everything I just said could apply to those things.

But think about who may benefit from VA benefits being cut (with public support, which I’m admittedly still so-so on if that bar could really be reached but…). It’d be a win for politicians given that we don’t hold a large voting majority and it’s a spending cut. And it’d be a win for both public and private entities that want that funding as well. Actually pretty much everyone except us wins from this. It’s a social benefit with no recourse for the government.

I mean hell look at what politicians the Heritage Foundation is associated with. They’re the same one that currently run on increasing VA benefits. Why the hell would they be associated with this interest group at all? It’s a huge red flag.

To put it simply. Fight like hell to make it clear that these kinds of proposals are unacceptable to you.",r/military,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnSEJnZzlTeXNSS25hZldIa3h5V29nd1ZONGpiMWNaa2huS1lWMEFOYXpISXllU3lqSDVXb0RrbjN4M214NTlTSUNUMVh2ZUZUcHNQMy1nUzRCNERoS2c9PQ==
"If I'm not mistaken, the point of Project 2025 is to use executive power to implement these policies, because these are things that can be done without legislation.

Furthermore, the Heritage Foundation staffed a lot of key positions in Trump's first administration; these Trump alumni then went back to work on P2025, and a lot of those people are likely to return to a second Trump administration.

Additionally, early in Trump's second year in office, the former president celebrated (via tweet) the fact that his administration had already implemented 64% of the Heritage Foundation's Trump agenda.

These people move in and out of public sector jobs, the entire project is deliberately designed to circumvent congress, and Trump has already demonstrated a willingness to let them into his administration to pursue their agenda.",r/military,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnRWZHV1JXSkNPRkhFNlJnVl80LU9vdGEyRkYzQ20xWDFyWl9SZFE2dGZ4NUlhMG1sSEEyZzcyQldzaVlmVDVwa1NYWG9WTldBZkpmb1phc2RrczRJS2c9PQ==
