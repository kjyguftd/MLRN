Yeah during WWII they were some exceptions since there were no modern awards that we have today that would have taken its place like the overseas service ribbon.

"The US left Vietnam after the signing of the 1973 Paris Peace Accords, which clearly stated South Vietnam would be independent, its citizens' right to self-determination would not be infringed, and military force would not be used to unite the country. A violation of this treaty after the US left does not constitute a failed objective, similar to how we do not consider Germany the victor of WWI simply because they stopped payments, rebuilt their military, and occupied France in violation of the Treaty of Versailles.

Sure, they were able to violate a peace treaty, overthrow their neighboring governments, and install the Pathet Lao and Khmer Rouge, resulting in the deaths of millions after Vietnam became irrelevant due to the Sino-Soviet Split. For some reason people like to pretend the US didn't do anything after that completely ignoring the history of the late 70's and 80's which resulted in Vietnam being internationally isolated and eating seedstock to keep from starving.

The US crushed the north Vietnamese during the Vietnam war, and when they violated the treaty they crushed them again.

"Europeans and Asians have never understood Americans or how things work in the US. They come from DEEP histories of warring empires living under monarchies and autocracies who used the citizenries as conscripted soldiers and support personnel, by force. The US is the first country to have true freedom for its citizens in the world. We are the first country to promote individualism instead of just being forced to be part of the collective. They believed Americans were hedonists because of our individualism and desire to stay neutral during the World Wars instead of just blindly joining the war like they all did. 

  
Europeans and Asians have always fought using brute force tactics in open warfare and weren't prepared for the level of tactical intelligence America uses. They have always believed traditional combat could overwhelm the American military and we would just give up like they do. They never took into account just how smart Americans are combined with how brutal we can be when we want to be. America has always been looked down upon by Europeans because of some sort of strange ignorant elitism simply because they have been around longer. Its their way of not having to come to terms with the fact the youngest kid in the family became the Patriarch of the family as a toddler. They hate the fact that America beat every major European power in combat and now they have to ask us for help every time they get into it with each other.

">Is the United States a democracy or a republic? This is one of those ‚Äúeither/or‚Äù questions that seems like it should have a straightforward answer; after all, two such different words must have two different definitions, right?

>The short answer is that democracy and republic are frequently used to mean the same thing: a government in which the people vote for their leaders. This was the important distinction at the time of the founding of the United States, in direct contrast with the rule of a king, or monarchy, in Great Britain. In part because that context was clear to everyone involved in the American Revolution, these terms were used interchangeably in the late 1700s. Both democracy and republic meant that the power to govern was held by the people rather than a monarch.

>At the same time, it‚Äôs true that there is nuance and difference between these words, according to their historical use and etymology: democracy comes from the Greek roots meaning ‚Äúrule by the people,‚Äù and the most basic understanding of the word‚Äôs original meaning refers to the direct democracy of ancient Greece.

>Republic comes from the Latin roots meaning ‚Äúpublic good‚Äù or ‚Äúpublic affair,‚Äù used in ancient Rome to mean simply ‚Äústate‚Äù or ‚Äúcountry‚Äù with reference to the representative democracy of the Roman Republic. The elected representatives in Congress are a contemporary example of this kind of government.

>Because democracy is an abstract name for a system and republic is the more concrete result of that system, democracy is frequently used when the emphasis is on the system itself. We could say that democracy is to republic as monarchy is to kingdom.

>These terms are not mentioned in the Declaration of Independence, a document that nevertheless expresses clearly that governments should be established ‚Äúderiving their just powers from the consent of the governed.‚Äù This reads like a definition of both democracy and republic. In Article IV Section IV of the Constitution, the term republican is used as an adjective: ‚ÄúThe United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government.‚Äù

>In the final analysis, what these words share in meaning is much more important than how they differ.


https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/democracy-and-republic


>You probably hear countries like the United States or France referred to as democracies. At the same time, you probably also hear both of these countries called republics. Is that possible? Are democracies and republics the same thing or different?

>We don‚Äôt blame you for confusing these two terms. With a major and heated US election underway, it‚Äôs the perfect time for some Government 101. Let‚Äôs brush up on these two words to see what they have in common‚Äîand what sets them apart.

>What does democracy mean?
>A democracy is defined as ‚Äúgovernment by the people; a form of government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised directly by them or by their elected agents under a free electoral system.‚Äù A nation with this form of government is also referred to as a democracy.

>A democracy is achieved by conducting free elections in which eligible people 1) vote on issues directly, known as a direct democracy, or 2) elect representatives to handle the issues for them, called a representative democracy.

>The word democracy dates back in English to around 1525‚Äì1535. It comes from the Greek dƒìmokrat√≠a, meaning ‚Äúpopular government.‚Äù Ancient Greece was home to what most consider to be the oldest form of democracy, the city-state of Athens. In Athens, the people (Greek, d√™mos) held the power (Greek, kr√°tos) and made the decisions for their society‚Äîforming a dƒìmokrat√≠a.

>But it‚Äôs essential to note the people who are able to vote in Athens only included certain non-enslaved Athenian men, making this direct democracy very different from the way we understand democracy today.

>What is a direct democracy?
For example, if a town only had enough funding to repair either their sewer system or roads, it might ask the citizens to vote on which one should get the money. Its members would vote on their preference, and the town‚Äôs government would follow the will of the people and go with their choice. This is a basic example of direct democracy.

>Many referendums are voted on this way, such as the Scottish independence (from the United Kingdom) referendum in 2014 and the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum (popularly referred to as Brexit) in 2016.

>What is a representative democracy?
>In contrast to a direct democracy, the people in a representative democracy elect representatives who act then on behalf of them, known as their constituents. Many of the world‚Äôs parliaments and the US‚Äôs Congress are an example of representative democracies.

>Today, it is inefficient, if not impossible, to have every eligible citizen vote on every issue‚Äîto vote on every piece of legislation that it takes to run a city, a state, a country. Instead, citizens vote for leaders to do the work of governing for them.

>Let‚Äôs revisit our municipal sewer/road matter. A representative democracy would not have each and every citizen of a town directly vote on whether to fund a sewer system or road repairs. Instead, the citizens would elect a mayor and city council to handle these issues in their place. The elected officials would then vote on where city funding should go, doing their best to reflect and respect the needs of the people who voted for them.

>What does republic mean? 
>A republic is defined as ‚Äúa state in which the supreme power rests in the body of citizens entitled to vote and is exercised by representatives chosen directly or indirectly by them.‚Äù Sound familiar? It should.

>You see, many of today‚Äôs democracies are also republics, and are even referred to as democratic republics. So, the US and France are considered both democracies and republics‚Äîboth terms point to the fact that the power of governance rests in the people, and the exercise of that power is done through some sort of electoral representation.

>The key concept to the word republic is that the leader of this government (or state) is not a hereditary monarch but a president, whether they are elected or installed.

>This core idea helps explain in part why autocratic governments like North Korea is officially called the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea. Its citizens vote (or ‚Äúvote‚Äù) on a single candidate. A historical example of a republic is also instructive. The Republic of Venice, a mercantile city-state of the Middle Ages, was led by a doge who was elected by wealthy merchants and served until his death. Neither of these governments would be considered a democracy.

>The word republic is first recorded in English 1595‚Äì1605. It comes from the Latin rƒìs p≈´blica, meaning ‚Äúpublic thing,‚Äù characterizing that a state is ultimately run by its people‚Äîas opposed to monarchy or tyranny. For nearly 500 years, ancient Rome was a republic before it became ruled by emperors.


https://www.dictionary.com/e/democracy-vs-republic/


>Republic, form of government in which a state is ruled by representatives of the citizen body. Modern republics are founded on the idea that sovereignty rests with the people, though who is included and excluded from the category of the people has varied across history. Because citizens do not govern the state themselves but through representatives, republics may be distinguished from direct democracy, though modern representative democracies are by and large republics. The term republic may also be applied to any form of government in which the head of state is not a hereditary monarch.

"Nitroamides derived from dinitrocarbamide, the most famous being TNGu ('Sorguyl' named after the French city of Sorgues) , ""K-6"", and TNPDU.  Theyre interesting very dense compounds of which most are not appropriate for industrial use due to high sensitivity and hydrolytic instability.   Also nitro derivatives of pyrazole.  The 3,4 isomer of dinitropyrazole is of military interest because its less sensitive than comp. B but still castable, the 3,5 isomer is denser and even less sensitive but doesnt have a low melting point, theres also a 1,3 isomer.  An amino derivative of the 3,5 isomer called ""LLM-116"" is I think in the final stages of research for military adoption.  The pyrazole ring has space for more nitro groups, and there are isomers of trinitro and tetranitro pyrzaoles which have been confirmed and studied, but their syntheses are a lot more complex since direct nitration doesnt yield these products, kind of like how TNT cannot be sucsessively nitrated to obtain tetra and penta nitrotoluenes which do exist and should be more powerful.

"Gramberg‚Äôs Military hospitalDuring the Balkan Wars in 1912 and 1913, military hospitals for wounded soldiers were opened in all bigger towns in Serbia. Most hospitals were in Belgrade where several thousand wounded soldiers were treated.The number of hospitals in Belgrade increased during the Second Balkan War with the Bulgarians (June-July 1913), even thirty-six in total; two permanent and thirty-four emergency hospitals. The last XXXIV emergency hospital was located in a onetime tavern Smutnikovac at the Topcider hill. The owner of the private hospital was the industrialist, banker and philanthropist Djordje Vajfert and it was run by his nephew, the lawyer and industrialist Ferdinand Gramberg.The producer Djordje Djoka Bogdanovic shot the everyday moments in this hospital as well as the ‚Äúcinematographic‚Äú stroll of the wounded soldiers, doctors and the hospital staff.

"The best study of Arab military culture is *Arabs at War: Military Effectiveness, 1948-1991*, by Dr. Kenneth M. Pollack. I read this book countless times. The main problem with Arab armies is how they cannot adapt to changing situations due to their culture of ""follow the leader"". They are inflexible, very shame sensitive and outright incompetent. While they can be brave, and sometimes even fanatically so, the Arabs have consistently ""punched below their weight"" and got defeated in espetacular fashion.

"What I find interesting about the battle's aftermath from a German perspective are the financial consequences. As it was custom to capture knights for ransom - and unthinkable to not ransom your own nobles - this caused an enormous financial burden on the Teutonic Order. It was so expensive, that they had to lend money by offering entire castles as safety. They Teutonic Order never really recovered from that. In 1455, they couldn't pay their mercenaries (from a different war) and had to give them Marienburg as a safety. Which was essentially their capital - the main castle of the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order. In 1457, when it became clear that the Order was no able to pay the debt, the mercenaries literally sold the castle to the Polish king. The Grand Master had to move his seat to K√∂nigsberg.",r/militaryhistory,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhQ1dQLWV0cFYzV0NrbmlKYTZxSnMxYWhFZDQxWC1tSnk2UDZhTF80aWl1MWRsMjMxM2UzLW96N2hHemU5Zzgzc2tjdFRSaXVvdVd6OUIwWjhselFNM3c9PQ==

"> all this time wasted

Had I actually responded we would have just argued about this and we both know we wouldn't have come to a mutual understanding... it would have been wasted no matter what and this is why I didn't want to argue with you, it wasn't to discuss the subject, only to argue about it.

"Absoluytely.  Westmoreland probably did worse than others could have, but the war was not winnable given the political realities.  The only way to win would have been an all out intervention and invasion of the North and subsequently wiping out the civil government.  Given this was absolutely not even remotely acceptable, the only outcome would have been some form of temporary settlement.

The JCS knew this as early as 1963.",r/militaryhistory,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnYmNxWVZVVTBtUUR3Y29ZWUZmMzhVeXRjS0dOQUE4ejF3UkZpVzdFdkdYbGo4b2U5VHlRUFVrY0MxMklwV2xyd0daRS1mcnZIay10cEtXaU9xNHJkc1E9PQ==
