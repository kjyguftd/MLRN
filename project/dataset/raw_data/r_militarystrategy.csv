"A great commander:

- Uses their grasp of logistics to ensure reliable supply lines, thereby maintaining the capability and moral of their troops by ensuring they're appropriately equipped, fed and rested  

- Has the charisma (personal magnetism) to earn the respect of their troops, but also inspires courage and loyalty, both on and of the battlefield, thereby maintaining leadership and moral  

- Understands the importance of using military  intelligence to discover as much as possible about the disposition of the enemy (and their leaders) and uses this knowledge to:  

     (1) identify potential/actual vulnerabilities to exploit/attack  
     (2) put themselves in the enemy's position/shoes, to try and predict what they're likely to do  

Just as they appreciate the importance of knowing  the mind and intent of the enemy, they also recognize the importance of preventing the enemy from doing the same to them and they use both deception and (where possible) surprise, to mislead the enemy and catch them unawares/unprepared. 

- Has a sound grasp of both strategy & tactics and  leverages these to make best use of the available resources in the current situation, including the terrain (and sometimes even the weather), to their advantage",r/militarystrategy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSQjBtVS1ONUhGLXdTV2FzUHdkSEVOWlgyckVjRVZ1NFB3QVZtcUhPeDBjbTIteklLSWhHaHhIbjRjY29GM01MT1FiS2xwZTZjc1FvRnlQUDFxbDZra1E9PQ==

"There could be something like a flamingo-effect involved aka mass psychology. You never know how willing the veterans are to fight when they have the impression that they might lose the battle. But if they are embedded in a larger unit and the bulk is moving towards the enemy lines, then it becomes less likely that an individual soldier will start running. Alone the effect of a synchronized move by a mass increases the overall discipline. 

Or take the perspective of soldiers being part of the main battle units. If they see many soldiers behind you, then it is already physically difficult for them to run in the other direction. On the other hand, if there were only the capable and willing fighting forces present, then they might run away as well. You need a very special culture (or a very capable leader or reason to fight) to enure that a small fighting force won't run away even in seemingly unwinnable situations. The classic example is the Spartans at Thermopylae.",r/militarystrategy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSNWU5bUdkZ0hscHFMNS1XU0xkcGF3Wm95NmlRa0JfRjJ5bzRtU19lenNJbE1MX21HNm5iUkZIVDBrMHdaV292S3lzYXN6UWFicHhlbFlYQ1Z5RHlFNUE9PQ==
"Watch movies with an emphasis on historic accurate depictions of battle tactics and analyze them. 

Gladiator has a very neat scene at the beginning, when \\*spoiler alert\\* Maximus goes against a horde of Germanic tribesmen. Or take Das Boot about a German WW2 submarine, where the movie was based on the book written by a WW2 submarine veteran. It can't get more realistic. I haven't seen it yet, but Tom Hanks movie about the Battle of the Atlantic is also said to be fairly realistic. So, you get both sides in one.

The battle scenes in war movies are often relatively short and make up 5-10% of the entire movie. You can cut them out and see what how and why things are done/depicted the way they are. In extension, don't forget the other scenes besides the battlefield. Psychology and motivation are most important for how successful different tactics are.

A counter example for a really lousy/unrealistic movie would Red Tails by George Lucas, because the planes do maneuvers in the movie that are physically impossible in reality. Or Fury with Brad Pitt, where  most of the movie is well done, but in the decisive confrontation, they used an element that was not possible back then.

Your goal would be to learn how and where to detect in war movies (perhaps also martial arts movies) the realistic parts and where they cheated for the sake of the story telling - this before reading or listening to [expert opinions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kcRTNBgqGc) about how realistic a specific war movie was.

"I don't know. It's hard to imagine a world, in which injury oftentimes meant certain death, while the difference in technology and tactics was relatively small and therefore depending on much bad/luck on either side. But even when you look at conflicts today, there is always just a small group that enters the battlefield without hesitation. All others follow, because they have to or feel the obligation to do so.

Just think of this hesitation on both sides. Nobody in the 5th row onward can be really sure, what would happen to them as a consequence for remaining or fleeing. Even if they win and their leader survives, would he even know that they ran? Or was it just a ""tactical retreat that brought the decisive turnaround""?

"I think so, too, but I see mainly evolutionary processes at work: Groups with religious zealotry had higher chances of winning and therefore could procreate more than moderates, which imprinted that tendency in the human genome.

Another concept would be initiation and masculinity rituals with different milestones. At one point, it is part of your mentality to accept the inevitable, if necessary. 

The problem with the latter is the limits to familiarity. There are several genetic limits to trust. One is the family with a dozen people, next comes the clan at \\~150 members and then comes the limit to anonymity at \\~5000 people.

Depending on the size of your army, you have to use different motivation methods. Above 5000 soldiers, only the the fanatic cult works and if you don't have that, you have to work with other individual and mass psychological tricks.

Also look at military unit sizes. They are all resembling these thresholds. I guess you could even make the argument that armies adapting to them have always been stronger than others putting the wrong emphasis on unit size.

Now you can ask yourself what happens or what you have to do for success in war without social cohesion, without religion and with gender stuff and the outlawing of manhood rituals.",r/militarystrategy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJST19HUkZKVkxvNWJrWERKVUI2S1V6ZXVzSERSRk5wQUM0SkNNbFB4VHNLRTN4TVcweVlFbUVETEF0T2liekU2UDdEZEc0U2N1cUJYdVRXakZjVzNGcWc9PQ==

It's the fifth quote in chapter 4 ""Dispositions"". Then I went to read the Chinese version of ""The Art of War"" to see what the original texts actually are. 

The original texts are, 不可胜者，守也；可胜者，攻也。This actually translates to, if the enemy cannot be defeated, then defend; if can be defeated, then attack. 

不 - not, 可 - possible, 胜 - win, 者 -  person, 守 -  defend; 可 - possible, 胜 - win, 者 - person，攻 - attack.

As to the size of the army, it has more to do with what strategist envisioned the war will play out like, you have to account for many unknown variables, when planning for battle, you not only picture ur strategy and approach but the opponents most likely response, and it just becomes a play by play like playing chess against yourself,  variables and factors based on information we have , with that  and the hindrances or challenges you stumble upon, and with all of this, most times armies would be bulked up bcz of this, more men means u become more flexible and adaptable to quick and sudden changes since you can wage 2 or 3 battles at the same time, it won't always be straight and 1 decisive battle",r/militarystrategy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSMF9XdXFUS3ZqWDAwZlZoQUs4NTkxVXNhNW9EeWw3eWJrNHlWVHc1cjFUYkNzM3RZMm1aaWtDQnBoYkpkNTJhLU9NaC1HcUc3VllCNG1NdFNrMDBabVdkckxxcTdRVGFrc3Nma0g1WFpxeDg9

"I'm 8 years late, but I've been doing my own research, which led me here, and I thought I might share what I've figured out so far, and it is that the Deeping wall isn't really guarding Hornburg itself. Both the wall and the fortress are part of the defence of Helm's Deep, that is, the valley and the gorge leading to the caves.

So why guard the caves at all? Well, if the wall gets overrun immediately, that would leave open the way into the caves where the women, children and old people are hiding, and cut off the route between the caves and the fortress. So the plan is to protect the gorge for as long as possible (and, ideally, not give in at all).

Now, wouldn't it be better if everyone just stayed in the fortress, as it is easier to defend than the caves? Probably, but it is said that 3/4 of the people of Westfold are hiding in the caves, along with large quantities of food and cattle, so presumably there simply isn't enough room in Hornburg to hold everyone.

PS Also, the wall leads into the fortress itself. The smaller gate(s) wouldn't be as fortified as the main gate and would be easier to breach. You say they can be attacked anyway, but that is only possible once the wall is overpowered. In the meantime, the wall would be easier to defend than an unfortified gate, so it makes sense to me to defend the wall first, and eventually retreat inside if the wall is overrun.",r/militarystrategy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSLXNsV20wWVdvV3ZFTDM3YVUtVFFQV0RkQjRDZm9rcXJMWUdRNFdmX1pCRWxtb2s3UUVJdFBickFoYVhzcFFlUEpKdUl3ZkdrUFJBVnNZSEVLdVQ4Znc9PQ==

"Actually pushing through the kill zone is THE most effective method of reducing casualties in a classic L shape ambush. 

When assaulting a static prepared defensive pos you need suppressive fire directed at known firing positions and to manoeuvre through dead ground, hard cover or concealment to get within effective weapons range of the target and engage.

You are missing a lot of details on the battle of Guagamela by using an image as your basis. I suggest reading the account of the battle by arrian. The reason why he formed his army in an oblique order was to first and foremost avoid encirclement and also to make it easier to concentrate his forces on weaker enemy position which he does when he finds a gap and also to easily mix light troops with heavy infantry and cavalry to make his charge more effective. His left flank was positioned at an angle to avoid encirclement with reserve on rear and a contingent of cavalry on the van in close support if infantry on the left. He marches his army in an echelon formation to move past the level ground in which case Darius's chariots will be rendered useless. In advance of his cavalry he had half of the Agrianis and archers with slingers form in an oblique order to close up to infantry incase of envelopment and in advance of that he had allied Greek cavalry with light cavalry. As he marched in column the enemy cavalry came in contact with the light cavalry in the right but the greek cavalry mixed with what is described as the old guard of mercenaries and other lighter troops who were hidden from Persian view behind the cavalry repulsed them so the left of Persian cavalry tried to envelop the right wing but in doing so the flank of Persian left was exposed and he promptly  siezed that moment and ordered light cavalry to attack on the flank while a gap was created in Persian center which he exploited. Alexander use of mixing light infantry with cavalry also helped protect his flank,r/militarystrategy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSdlZmdXloaW9MTHg1X3BEdU54andjX0ZiYlM1eGx6aEY4NGFKcXJlWjNxemx2RmppcVZaWWV3ZlJCY19sYURHcU5HeUJfOUdDejNaR2V6ZnRIY1dMdS1sREtDU3AzaVFoOVVKeHJqdnkyc2M9
