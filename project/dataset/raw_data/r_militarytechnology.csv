"Then i assume it is more rational by properties balance, than full-solid wheels . I was thinking a filled/{full-solid} wheel would be the best, but nothing confirms this to be the case .

But i feel like such wheels wouldn't be the best choice for durability after damage: because they need to withstand high-velocity force redistribution and light jumps for 30+ minutes, including a possible cost factor; Can you mention any specific vehicles which use them ?

"IR missles lock on to a heat source that heat source is bounced off programs that they have trained so we can try key word try to not have a false positive on a flare. 

Radar guided missiles which only a few countries have lock on to the shape size of the plane as it approaches. 

Just like that new bomber was unveiled its stealth to low freq radar and what the world switched to high freq. Current stealth only does one that thing could drop bombs on Moscow and no one would see it coming. Its a first strike weapon pure and simple

Current sensors on planes to detect incoming missles have been trained to detect optically now if its real or not. We used to use UV based sensors. When a missile is going through the sky it gives off alot of UV light but the problem is runaways also give off alot and in the past has resulted in counter measures going off.",r/militarytechnology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSeDFfQWY4RXJkZ013aklNNkpIVm0wRUV0cVV5T0FzeU5VOEZkRjJvdm91QnloV0VvWUFON2hnYThfeGE1OGJUdVE2MlFCY29mTm9fN2s5UnhuT19YQlE9PQ==

"So there not viable because of technology. Those guns simply cant reach inside the shoreline far enough and it requires close in quarters for ship to ship. 

USAs whole concept is to strike you so far away you never see us. Much can be gained by looking at a aircrafts or ships design. Take the Chinese J20 cockpit the canopy is huge. China built a regional dogfighter. Take our F35 the pilot cant see behind him well he can with his special helmet but for USA were taking your ass out dozens of miles away like 80-90 with AMRAAM missles next gen is on the horizon even further. 

Look at a ramp assist carrier vs catapult. Everything you need to know about a countries intent on a carrier is from that. Ramp assist means on average 30% less fuel. Less fuel less range. USA uses catapult systems for maximum loads and fuel. We have no interest in 21 century of you bringing the fight to us well hit you before you even know whats coming. 

But to make them viable they would have to have a rail gun. Problem with rail guns is when there fired there is a immense plasma burst that happens. The cannon itself only lasts 4-5 shots. The problem is the coating inside we have not invented one that allows continious firing of a rail cannon. Makes that idea pretty unviable unless its ground based. You would be better off building a ship that can hold like 100 cruise missiles. 

The other question is why would you want this? Sec of Defense Gates under Bush and Obama greatly questioned the Marine Corps future AAV plans. Chinas surface to sea missiles are greater then the launching range of the new AAVs. How would a amphibious assault over come that in a machine that is not up-armored going slow with no counter measures?",r/militarytechnology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSZ0lWYkhlQVpueTBpbzgwSy01ZFYyejNrbExEanZ3MTFnZ0F2RnRSeGVTRWJ1Nmp6OXdMcGhPOWJfbGEwZUduQ3E2dGxQZThocm82X21KMThhZUZwSHc9PQ==

"Stormbreaker. Revolutionary weapon USA has. It has multiple sensors to lock on. It can be dropped through a canopy of clouds uses infrared, optical and millimeter radar. 

What your not seeing is GPS lock on is essentially what your seeing. The NRO and our legion of planes the military has dedicated to this have mapped every square inch of the planet. Things really do not change that month year to year. The building 10 miles down the way from you was there yesterday, today and tomorrow. If you know those GPS coordinates then you know your target. 

Plus Tesla is going back to radar based well adding it back to there cars. The big three automative makers actually have commented on Teslas's singular image system. In there tests it was extremely unreliable. Apple has tested that out to and Tim Cook told them to figure out something else. 

Also your missing the fact we don't need exact precision for guided munitions. A Hellfire Missle has about 5 pounds of TNT. If one was to hit your house it would be toast and much around it. A 500lb bomb the explosion is HUGE. 1000lb bomb it looks like a mushroom cloud from a nuke went off. 

Only a idiot would think or believe what they say when they tell you how careful we deploy our weapon systems. 

The other thing your lacking on this is human body is over 90% water. Your not dying from the actual explosion your dying from the shockwave at 20,000 feet a second of air destroying your body. You can kill a human 3 ways. A gunshot bleed out like a hunter would know about, a shot to the area of your skull where your nerve cluster is which makes you turn off like a robot or hydrostatic shock. The last being how the majority die in a gun fight or explosion.

"How would it make it as a first strike well if Northrup is correct that its invisible to all forms of radar you simply fly over it and drop your payload and your out before it even hits the ground. 

True warfare if its unlimited there is no need for precision per say. Your goal is to kill the enemy and break his things. 

Its like USA if China really wanted to make USA suffer they would simply cut off the medications. 90% or something of our antibiotic's come from them so do most of our Chemotherapy meds.

"My followup to this point is that image recognition can alert but doesn’t give you any telemetry data to make a firing solution based off of. The above commenter mentioned how former sensors used uv to alert for incoming missiles. The same could be said for incoming stealth bombers if you had a good enough optical sensor with a wide aperture. But you can’t tell how fast an object is moving using only optical sensors unless you have a frame of reference, and in the sky there is none. Nor can you predict it’s vector. In theory, the most realistic solution
Would to have a laser with a wide beam illuminate a target to provide guidance data, after an optical sensor detects, but there is no benefit to this system over just sending an interceptor up to fight",r/militarytechnology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSMk4ybU16eGhIS25CNWtRd3BiZXNQblJ4aU1QeG5WTU54Zm5pZURGcTdGRkg2d216VzFDUE9GaGQ5ZnNsdFhjUzZ4cGwydXBsLTdHUm5WUDJnQWp6VVE9PQ==
"Really no need. The problem is a actual gun that fires traditionally has a very limited range. Take USMC putting HIMARs chained to the deck of their carriers. That has more destructive ability and a range well over 100 miles. It makes all the guns of all the Battleships ever made look stupid. Technology has made them obsolete. 

So movies etc like to show Rail Guns. Its like Fusion always 10 years away. The problem is the very act of using a Rail Gun destroys your barrel. The plasma created is over 10,000 degrees I think and they have yet to find a material to stand up to that abuse. So you get half a dozen shots out of your gun and something that weighs in the tons has to be replaced. No sailor will be doing that. 

A few years ago the Navy had a concept of a arsenal ship. A ship outfitted with dozens of cruise missile silos. Much better alternative to a battleship. 

Also bear in mind as well that the whole idea of USA forces is we strike from far go back home to reload and you never encounter us..thats in a traditional war. USA does not like extended conflicts.

"I think it’s fake. TLDR: it makes no sense to add blades to a missile that will fulfill it’s goal without them. 

1. It’s a 5ft missile, 7 inches in diameter with a 13 inch wingspan. If that hits you or any where near you you’re a stain on the ground. Why add blades 

2. This missile needs to be precise. Adding 6 more in effect wings in the final approach seems unnecessarily complex potentially making the weapon less precise. 

3. The more complex a Maschine is the higher the probability is for failure. Keep it simple stupid.
