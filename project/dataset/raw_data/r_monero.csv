"Well as long as monero’s tail emission protocol doesn’t dramatically change to increase the coin creation rate far beyond the rate coins are lost then stable coins are kinda irrelevant in a circular economy with monero as the primary currency. 

The currency will “effectively” be backed by the demand for the exchange of products, services, and fungible non-renewable non-perishable commodities to be traded with the currency. And as long as there’s unique utility to use xmr instead of fnrnp commodities as a currency, it will be exchanged when needed for that purpose. And as long as theres a demand for the exchange of these goods and services, there will be a demand for the currency that increases the economic efficiency of the net exchange of these goods and services. 

There will still be market crashes or declines that reduces the value of xmr shortly after a large section of the market becomes dramatically less liquid for an anticipated lengthy period of time. 

If you want an asset that retains value independent of market demand then store a fnrnp commodity that has utility that’s independent of market demand. Preferably assets you desire to utilize independently. fnrnp commodity Collateral backed stable coins require enforcement which probably is not what the average anarchist wants. Backing it using an equal value of xmr compared to the commodity without the need for enforcement defeats the purpose of these stable coins because xmr would be relatively less stable than the commodity in the market conditions you’d be trying to hedge against.",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTRlRHT040Z1RYTG1sQ2FDdm1TMmQ5VUNWUUFkTmMwc1M1UmVDb1VJcnhaQ3lHYmRkWm4weUZVWXlYNmRBUVlKSWx4eFNsSGNERENkV1R2YjVtVmhkdDJiUFFfNEk4c3BUTHlpaTdGU1AweGs9

It also seems to allege the person used the same wallet to pay namecheap for an incognito related domain as they used to interact with their KYC exchange account. I find it likely the FBI had compromised the wallet view or even private key at some point, but even if they didn't, opsec here was sloppy. Too much money in an exchange, too eager to cash out, and as you pointed out the fact that the market wasn't XMR-only.

"I think it's probably a coincidence, or mostly a coincidence. In terms of the dollar value of a cryptocurrency an ETF does actually matter because of all the dollars that can only be invested in it if there is one, same reason Binance listing matters. The SEC seems to have not really wanted to approve it but did so because they would lose the ensuing lawsuit if they didn't. They have a special hatred for privacy coins, but also hate all crypto.

Dollar value matters for network security, but it's not the only thing that matters. One thing I worry about is that tradfi buy-in will contribute to cryptocurrencies becoming less decentralized and more KYC'd. A great thing about the Monero community is that it generally cares about the privacy more than the price, which I think would tend to become less true for cryptocurrencies with a lot of stakeholders that only care about the price and maybe are ok with losing independence from corporate and nation state control. The way things are playing out currently, to me, does not seem like the ideal circumstances for rendering Monero useless for its purpose.

"He wont do this, but if he did it would be a good thing. People shouldn't go to jail because of what they put in their bodies or for facilitating people to get products they want if it's not harming anyone. To my knowledge, the whole ""hiring a hitman"" stuff that was claimed to have happen was all fabrication that was never actually true.

The legalization of drugs is conflicting for me. On one hand, it would be a good and moral thing to do, they're only still illegal to get slaves for private prisons.

On the other hand it would really cripple Monero, lets be honest, a lot of the demand for Monero is these multimillion dollar drug markets. The project could unironically be at serious risk of becoming too obscure at this point, which is sad, but it's also just reality. People don't really care about privacy.

Of course, the positives outweigh the negatives. I wouldn't pretend that we should keep drugs illegal for the sake of a cryptocurrency project, but it made me do a bit of self reflection on how financial motivations can sway one's moral character the first time I thought about it.

If you take anything from this though, promote privacy principles to others.

"From a post years ago:

He hired multiple hit men to kill multiple people, and those hitmen fake-killed those people and sent fake evidence of their dead bodies.

"That's the funny thing. He was never charged for it, but he was sentenced for it. 

Feds posed as people who knew his personal details knew his address knew his family and threatened to kill them. Then another fed reached out to help the problem ""disappear"". Now being a sane, empathetic, and rational person and fearing for his family's life, he ordered the hit.

Of course he was never charged for this. If he were, he would be able to claim entrapment as a defense. However, in sentencing, a judge can use a separate set of facts that were used to determine guilt and these facts have a lower burden of proof than actual criminal charge.

So the truth is even more sinister. The prosecutors conspired with the judge to get a sentence enhancement on him before he was even arrested, obviously with the law intended punish cruel drug lords.

"I am skeptical about when multisig will ever be released. I am aware that the new seraphis update is promising that, but that is a long ways away at this point. 

2) that Monero - while a technical feat of cryptographic and engineering genius, is failing still as socially it is not as well-known - or marketed - as other cryptos, and that also means that it will only viewed for its negative connotations. Privacy and freedom should be the default, however sadly we cannot expect regular people to do their own reserch or market it. Do we have a monero marketing department?

3) I just read another comment here and tried to get haveno working. Since Kraken and other DeX's have been delisting it in  more and more countries - or just outright delisting it globally - as Binance did - 

is the piecemeal DEX infra enough - or far along at their stages of development to keep the passionate core of Monero users - and newcomers- afloat? How do we ensure also that the price stays stable or verifiably high if more DEX's delist it, and govts wage economic warfare against the Monero project? 

  
4) Are there any hw wallets that are open-source that Monero can run on - the monero seed-signer project is to my knowledge still not ready, and Trezor's are open-source, but there are exploitable flaws using Trezor's.. Ledger's while cheaper - also have that whole Recover vuln and the company has made some very dubious choices in the past 3-4 years to put it kindly. 

  
5) I have many suggestions and ideas for a marketing campaign of sorts, I am aware that many do not want to - much less feel the need to market Xmr, as it does just work, and it stands on our own, but market share and visibility is critical to also changing the tide against legislation against it. Bitcoin was not banned, but instead co-opted because it was too big to fail after a while. Xmr cannot be co-opted as long as the devs stay secure, and true to their ethics, the codebase is safe and not watered down by a change in the values or focus on the majority of the dev/user base, and so as long as it is so strong.. it can not be co-opted. However it can definately co-opt or transform societies.

Even if we assume grin is marginally better (which, I doubt is actually true) there is no reason to use it when Monero has much more usage (even if said usage is low).

">I am skeptical about when multisig will ever be released. I am aware that the new seraphis update is promising that, but that is a long ways away at this point.

To be honest, there is just not enough demand. There is rhino wallet or whatever and some difficult ways to do it but in general most people are just going to wait until seraphis.

>that Monero - while a technical feat of cryptographic and engineering genius, is failing still as socially it is not as well-known - or marketed - as other cryptos, and that also means that it will only viewed for its negative connotations. Privacy and freedom should be the default, however sadly we cannot expect regular people to do their own reserch or market it. Do we have a monero marketing department?

Usually coins with a ""marketing department"" had premines or some other way to market themselves. The truth is that Monero isn't very popular because people don't care about privacy enough to realize it's potential. It doesn't have promises of 1000x gains like random tokens that, technically speaking have no real usage.

If privacy (not just Monero) became more mainstream then the project would be more successful.

>is the piecemeal DEX infra enough - or far along at their stages of development to keep the passionate core of Monero users - and newcomers- afloat? How do we ensure also that the price stays stable or verifiably high if more DEX's delist it, and govts wage economic warfare against the Monero project?

In my opinion atomic swaps between chains would be the best solution long term, then you can just get any token and swap, preferably with one well designed GUI application.

>Are there any hw wallets that are open-source that Monero can run on - the monero seed-signer project is to my knowledge still not ready

I don't believe so. That said, you can use offline signing instead, you don't really need a hardware wallet if you have technical know how.

Or, using a Tails install is a good option too for people who aren't able to understand how to do the above. It's not perfect, but it's very unlikely to ever get exploited if all you do is run the Tails install to use for sending funds. It's also simple enough for everyone (if drug addicts can do it, so can anyone else).

>I have many suggestions and ideas for a marketing campaign of sorts, I am aware that many do not want to - much less feel the need to market Xmr, as it does just work, and it stands on our own, but market share and visibility is critical to also changing the tide against legislation against it. 

The issue is the lack of care for privacy that people have. Marketing efforts for this project will probably not do anything without getting people to care about privacy first.

"I got this information from Coingecko and the links they provided regarding GRIN. What are your sources?

How can you state on one end that : ""Grin is disinflationary, with inflation converging toward 0"" and on the other that ""Tail emission is good. Tail emission from launch is the best.""?

A currency is meant to represent value (i.e. ""work""). It is too volatile, it fails at being a  currency.

I do not see any value in GRIN, and I must not be the only one, considering its market cap of $7 millions and the fact that it's been there for over 5 years. It was launched on January 17th, 2019, with a unit value of $25.09, floored at $3.34 on January 20th 2019 (3 days later). If you would have paid $7,000 on the day of the launch of this token, you would have found yourself with a value of $1,000 3 days later, a net loss of $6,000. 

No matter how long you would have held (HODL! HODL!) your tokens, even with perfect timing (selling them at their peak afterwards, on January 28th, 01:00), you still would have lost HALF your bet. Holding on longer than that would have just bled you even more, to no benefit whatsoever.

">Tail emission from launch is the best.

Not really. It means that it cannot function as a store of value in any meaningful way until a long time passes such that the inflation rate goes down.

The value of frontloading the emmission for Monero is that inflation became low faster.

That said, it doesn't really matter. Nobody has a reason to use grin because it doesn't offer anything revolutionary.

"This following argument only applies to mass adoption. I know that Monero won't die no matter the price, because there will always be people who require tools to protect their human right to financial privacy digitally.

Delisting of Monero is inevitable from many CEX, however, there will always be some that do not fold to regulations, or operate in places with strong privacy rights.

I do agree that a complete delisting from all CEX is ideal for Monero, since DEXs like Haveno exist. But if only a couple CEX remain, doesn't that give more power to control price to each of the CEX, as opposed to distributing it across many CEX?

And putting the tinfoil hat on, what if governments make deals with these few remaining CEX to suppress the price of Monero because that's the best they can do to dissuade the common person from using it. Outright banning it just leads to free press and proves that Monero is too good.",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlR1dXd2JZWEJ1YTNHblRUZl9nbWhNb0tmZ0NMYU9RMHZGZWR0aXdESjJfeHZzN3ZxRGxPNl9ZejhYUkRZZUFFZTI0VHhLbkxyYTQyWWI3bTNscVM5V0hzUDB4dGxpc3YxTkEzQ2lacVREOHM9

"As more CEX delists Monero, it's essentially inaccessible to the common people. 

Price suppression is an effective method of controlling Monero as less people will show interest in it. However, its true value is derived from its privacy technology.

Ultimately, what we're looking for is price stability. If it becomes too volatile, it becomes a speculation game, for example, BTC. As long as the price is stable enough over prolonged period, people will use it as a currency and storage of value, irrespective of the price.

Even assuming the government's underhanded pressure on CEX to manipulate price, the value and market demand is strong enough that it's currently sitting at around $140.

"I looked closer into this: it is possible to launch tokens on solana that have this feature enabled with the new token 2022 standard. But the issue is that currently the most commonly used DEX like raydium for example don't allow tokens to be traded that have this feature enabled.

So you would have to run your own DEX if you wanted to use this. There is also the option to have an ""auditor"" that can decrypt all the amounts. But that is optional and the token issuer can choose to not enable it.

But besides this new confidential transfers token extension there are also other projects that add privacy to solana. With v1.18.0 there are new features baked into the solana runtime to compute zero knowledge proofs efficiently. 

So while it is still in is infancy, I would not dismiss these efforts entirely. We should welcome it and see where we can find synergy with the solana community.

It is obviously going to play an important role in this cycle.",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJma01fT0daNmxKSEtXcjZsTHFCcWdVYmt6UFhETnVBbmp6MkllaFBXbGdSckVWSHhFdndBdm9FVTNsWE9QZDlvV2c5U1pZZnNnb0tBY3ktTkVBQlJzNXc9PQ==
"it depends on the issuer. The auditor is an optional feature for the ""compliance"" VC startup people.

But anyone can issue a shitter with the auditor disabled and pump it to valhalla. 

Still the limitation is the lack of sender and receiver privacy in the current confidential transfers token extension. But consider it more as an example repo than a full fledged solution.

"Really interesting graph. May I ask for some additional clarification?

When taking a look at the [Zephyr nonce distribution](https://api.hashvault.pro/v3/zephyr/network/nonce/distribution/png?hashrate=true&nonceColor=%23ff6600), there's no such ""stripe miner"" phenomenon. The nonces seem to be distributed evenly. On the other hand, [Monero nonce distribution](https://api.hashvault.pro/v3/monero/network/nonce/distribution/png?hashrate=true&nonceColor=%23ff6600) has the ""stripe miner"".

So, in theory, someone has been able to figure out a potential nonce distribution with the highest possibility of landing a block, right? If so, is it only applicable for rx/0 or other RandomX variants? What could be the potential mitigation(s) against it?",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsanNSeV9sWjVlZ1FpYWVCZGpXcDdXZjBzdExxS1dNbFU1TmJEVDRkUEtVYU45MXE0aG5ZVlBHUEFSTmV0VWVmSG4zRVlXNWNHcmkzYnhJYVlaaHRKdWc9PQ==
"Checking other coins that HashVault supports:

* [Sumokoin](https://api.hashvault.pro/v3/sumo/network/nonce/distribution/png?hashrate=true&nonceColor=%23ff6600): Nonce distribution is quite biased and correlated with difficulty w/ a couple of stripes.
* [Aeon](https://api.hashvault.pro/v3/aeon/network/nonce/distribution/png?hashrate=true&nonceColor=%23ff6600): Several nonce bands.
* [Haven](https://api.hashvault.pro/v3/haven/network/nonce/distribution/png?hashrate=true&nonceColor=%23ff6600): Pretty even nonce distribution.
* [Leathen](https://api.hashvault.pro/v3/lethean/network/nonce/distribution/png?hashrate=true&nonceColor=%23ff6600): Stripe hellscape.
* [Masari](https://api.hashvault.pro/v3/masari/network/nonce/distribution/png?hashrate=true&nonceColor=%23ff6600): Pretty even nonce distribution w/ a couple of stripes.
* [Conceal](https://api.hashvault.pro/v3/conceal/network/nonce/distribution/png?hashrate=true&nonceColor=%23ff6600): Another stripe hellscape.

I understand that it's not directly comparable with Monero.

"Hate to be a Negative Nick, but recently I lost a very big sum (at least to working class me) via P2P CBM. I posted elsewhere (on Reddit) about it. US Priority Mail Express (USPS). TRIPLE envelope sealed as advised, then inside the main PME envelope. Someone--USPS couldn't have been LESS helpful after the theft--intercepted the packet, CUT OPEN all the layers (I have the images of the damage) with a straight edge, took the contents, then stuffed the innermost envelope back into the ripped open PME envelope while discarding the middle layer envelope. USPS delivered that hot mess to the recipient in a clear plastic bag. TWO WEEKS LATE. Called multiple USPS offices. Emailed them. Not only did they not care--they wouldn't even speak with the delivery agent to confirm the package had been delivered in the condition in the images the professional mailbox service shared with me--they treated ME like a criminal.

And the marketplace overseeing the trade ad? All they'd tell me is ""Contact USPS."" Pfft.

I will NEVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES AGAIN USE P2P CBM. No one will make you whole if you become a theft victim.

"> Donate if you want faster progress

I agree with /u/Spearmint9 here: At the moment I think it's more promising to put bounties on particular features of Haveno that should get implemented. Who knows, maybe such bounties would even be able to attract more devs, and Haveno development would not rest on the shoulders of Woodser alone to a quite high degree anymore.

Developing a mobile Haveno is probably a large project in itself, whichever approach you choose, and IMHO needs careful planning and coordination. I see a danger that this bounty will not result in ""faster progress"", but wasted time and false hopes e.g. because of people applying for the bounty that have no clue what they get themselves into.",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJteDU1b0tQaEZwcXN3dER0QlRmZ1lRSHV0Q243a1JaN1Q1V0pLSW5ONzhiUlhlTmlkc3RiNlEzc2tJSUpMNkRGOXRjMUVEMkQ2cEZfMl90Yl9SZk1MTlE9PQ==

"What ""currencies"" are you talking about gaining adoption? What are the cryptos you see regular businesses accepting as payment IRL? Sure enough, I saw some Italian restaurants in Laos accepting BTC back in the days, makes perfect sense, ha ha ha! I am sure they sold plenty of pizze for BTC there too! It's perfectly possible for banks and organizations to use XMR within the law. It is probably already happening, to be truthful. The main thing is traceability of funds. XMR offers you obfuscation but does not prevent you from traceability if you choose to disclose it. It might be banned to be used in some unsecure or control freak countries such as China or AUE, however, it is permissionless. I am sure you remember that dirty word from the BTC manifesto? That was BTC's selling point, soon discarded for the promise of a get-rich-quick Ponzi scam scheme. Eventually, the cows get to come back home and the chickens back to roost in their coops. Just wait for the state of the world to turn a little bit more rocky, and I'd be surprised if XMR were not to be accepted by the majority!

"Someone's been screwing around with Monero for a while.

Monero has had a small but strong demand base for many years now. The demand base maintains a steady upward pressure on the price. But every time the price rises by even a few %, some scum-sucking terdbrain dumps a hundred or so xmr on the market, way below market price, so it never goes up the way it should.

First I thought it was a whale, maybe a developer with a couple of million xmr trying to keep it affordable to the masses. That's kind, and noble, but also annoying.

Then Binance blew a fuse and people started dumping it, and that just amplified the problem. But only very briefly because those of us smart enough to understand why Monero is the best decentralized cryptocurrency in the world weren't going to let that fire sale opportunity pass us by. :)

Recently it crossed my mind that the original dumper could be a miner. But why in the world would a miner keep dumping their hard-earned xmr at a discount? Unless it's run by a well funded adversary. The same entity responsible for the recent spam attack, maybe.

Last time I checked the price it was $135. Today I was pleasantly surprised to see it at $150. Then I find this topic here about the hash rate drop. Really? I hope this means the original dumper shut down their mining operation, and xmr is now free to reach escape velocity. :D",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuYkRvTkp3S1ZIanc3WHBrY3NwQS1VajBJOUZGMi1BUmgzYVVzZVlmVmtKbHVnSnQ3ektkbm9Mc2ZnTl90NEtDdjRQYXpsQjc0V01FcEFoZHg2UzNUZWc9PQ==

"Hey,

There are definitely some offers available at this time (see here: **https://ibb.co/bPP5nFp**).

Here are a few steps to resolve your issue:

1- Make sure that you're running the latest version from the master branch as some recent update made offers posted on previous versions not compatible with the newer. If you're using the Docker version, make sure to also update your Docker image, not just git pull (your instance should show BSX: v0.13 or higher at the bottom of the GUI).

2- As some mentioned, you must have your coin cores fully synced up to see offers, and also give it a bit of extra time after reaching 100% for the SMSG network (the mixnet that broadcasts offers to the rest of the network) to also be synced up.

3- If that doesn't help, there is another issue that can be fixed. In that case, feel free to join the BasicSwap matrix room here: **https://matrix.to/#/#basicswap:matrix.org**. There are a lot of active contributors there that will be able to assist you in getting BasicSwap running properly, and that will also help in resolving issues for future users as well!

And finally, the more liquidity and the more people in the community post offers, the more convenient BasicSwap becomes!

**Note:** Usability and accessibility is a big focus moving forward. You may want to take a look at this CCS proposal waiting to be merged: [https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/ccs-proposals/-/merge\\_requests/457/](https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/ccs-proposals/-/merge_requests/457/), it aims to address directly a lot of the obstacles that makes adoption and usage of the platform a bit more on the tricky side at this time.

"I'm actually glad to see this mentioned. I also thought it was a ghosttown before -- but as others have said at least currently I can see there are offers. It is usable, and there are offers, but the offers that have been there recently have been priced pretty badly, and also little liquidity per offer. This as far as I can tell is due to several things regarding usability and functionality:

1. Offers expire with a max of 48 hours. So either you have to continually repeat the offer manually, or you could use a script, which I don't know exists. I heard of a market-maker script somewhere, idk. Even then I wouldn't just use some random person's script without looking at it, it would be better if it came from the devs and implemented as an actual function in the interface itself to repeat the offer automatically. This is why it seems completely dead, since if people don't keep renewing their offers they disappear. But it's a cycle -- if more people were takers, more makers' offers would be taken, and then the makers wouldn't leave and give up using it.
2. At least with BTC I had trouble trying to use several UTXOs in a single swap as a maker. I always got errors saying that I didn't have enough bitcoin in my addresses to make the offer, and when I made offers that were within individual UTXOs that was fine. Idk if that's just my system or what but that makes it much more annoying to offer larger amounts, as I would have to spend the funds to consolidate UTXOs. This I think is pretty huge for having bigger offers.
3. Getting things setup in the first place was fairly annoying and you pretty much have to be the type of person to run your own nodes for the coins you're swapping anyway. Even though I do like the interface generally and it is actually astounding that the atomic swaps work, there are technical barriers that would prevent most users from even getting started. Although I will say, ime Bisq and Haveno are technically annoying to setup also, and they are actually much worse trust-wise in terms of relying on an arbitration system, which leaves me wondering why people always mention them and never say much about basicswapdex or other atomic swap software. Haven't tried unstoppableswaps myself but I kinda sense it's a similar issue w/ lack of offers/takers; if someone has tried it i'd love to hear about it.

I will say that I believe this and other atomic swap systems to be some of the MOST important projects involving monero. To me, the main use for Haveno is fiat to xmr directly. But the arbitration system has flaws and really needs to be ironed out...the thing is, it's possible to completely sidestep those issues with atomic swaps! we have the technology! all it needs is to fix some not too difficult usability issues (see above at least). and more people to be talking about atomic swaps lol.

#USE NON-CUSTODIAL CEX AKA ""INSTANT SWAP EXCHANGES"" WITH CAUTION

Centralized instant swap exchanges which come with their own set of problems and risks can be a good way for many to route around CEX/CRYPTOBANKS.

Often those come with higher fees, shotgun KYC or are selective scams like ""Changelly"". 

Most of them depend on external liquidity (or are fronts for CEX), which means they will halt or freeze the exchange process just as often as CEX (main culprits are ChangeNow and FixedFloat). In times of bigger market movements many of those sites will abandon trades that are not favorable for them.

You can use an aggregator like **Trocador.app (🔒 .onion/i2p)** that has a security bond for transactions of up to $1000 and gives you a clear indication about competitive pricing and KYC risk. Other reputable resources to evaluate exchange risk are kycnot.me (🔒 .onion/i2p) and orangefren.com (🔒 .onion/i2p)

#Satoshi taught us not to entrust our money with third parties.

> Not your key, not your coins


Crypto is all about control over your own money. If you don't self-custody, it means you entrust your stack, in some cases your life savings, with a third party that may or may not have ulterior motives, may or may not be a scam or may or may not be controlled or extorted by a rogue government.

The process of learning to become self-sovereign might include some pain. But as crypto history shows us, keeping ""your"" coins in the hands of a custodian is a 100% guarantee to set yourself and the community up for failure.

If you are in it for the gain, be smart and do it on-chain.


#What exchanges to use then?

There are plenty of better (more secure, private, trustless) however still more inconvenient solutions that are preferable over using KYC/CEX. Those often come at a higher price as security and privacy have a price, but not necessarily at a lower speed. Indeed starting from zero,  signing-up for a cumbersome and intimidating KYC process will often take days or weeks sometimes placing holds on funds while a DEX like Haveno will give you access to coins <1 hour and coming at the benefit of not giving up your right to privacy.


Exchange method | Exchanges| Trust level
---|---|----
DEX | Haveno (🔒 .onion), bisq (🔒 .onion) | ✅ escrow
P2P | Robosats, Peach Bitcoin, Paxful, ~~LocalMonero~~, ~~AgoraDesk~~| ✅ escrow
Atomic swaps | UnstoppableSwap.net, AtomicMonero, BasciSwapDEX, ~~Samourai Wallet~~ | ✅ trustless
AMM  (automatic market makers) | SeraiDEX, Maya| low for users / medium for liquidity providers (hacks)
Mining (""buy"" via electricity) | Gupax, XMRrig, Monero GUI | ✅ trustless
Earning (""buy"" via products and services) | any products or services | low - ⚠️ high (scams)


#What can you do?

If you are into cryptocurrencies for more than just some side gamble you really want to learn how to use the right tools to manage your money in a self-sovereign and self-custodial way. The more people learn about the risks involved and how to mitigate them the better for you and the health of the whole ecosystem.

#Self-sovereignity starts with the wallet you use.

*Be aware that different risks apply to the security of your operating system. Do not store significant amounts on desktop, mobile or web wallets! Always use an air gapped storage method for significant amounts.*

"its possible your ISP could be blocking ports?

you can try https://canyouseeme.org/ to see if the internet can see your port at your IP.

if you suspect the ISP blocking a port, you can just try binding another port for p2p connections. 

also, incoming connections are only important for new nodes syncing to the network. Your outgoing connections are still getting your node into the network, and thus involving your node in block and tx relay etc.

How about we tallk about the fact that every single monero wallet available is 100% garbage. I have to keep one open because it take forever to sync but half the time I go to buy a gift card and it gives me an error. So I have to shut it down and wait another 20 minutes for this piece of crap to synchronize. Then when I send a transaction if I don't immediately hit the show progress button it doesn't show up in my transaction list until there is one confirmation. Annoying. Even when I open the app and go to type in my password and realize the focus is not in the text box and I have to click on there with my mouse. It gets me every time.

"Basically yes.

Cake wallet is just that; a wallet. It's a convenient one as it acts as a moderator for exchanges and the like, but cake wallet doesn't do the exchanges themselves or anything. Just kind of mediate it.

">I thought the key aspect of RandomX is ASIC resistance through random code execution.

No, it's only one of them. Memory hardness is another one and it's equally important. Reducing scratchpad size to less than 2 MB makes the algorithm much weaker. Intel CPUs have 2 MB L3 cache per core since [2008](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/37147/intel-core-i7-920-processor-8m-cache-2-66-ghz-4-80-gt-s-intel-qpi.html), so they can run 1 thread per core. I think it's enough reason to say that 2 MB is lightweight enough in 2024. 2 MB size was chosen for the original Cryptonight exactly for this reason (in 2013!!!), and RandomX kept it.",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3UmN1VFVOQ2dZYlpHRk9Ya3RHMFFpeVBsR2h5MWlrR2NsVHRzZ0xZRmNtOU9iTDJKeTN5QUtiYTladm9nN2xLN0RnWFVZcFRGT3A2YjBKYlFOOV9VeXc9PQ==

"I invite you to make a step back, look outside the small world of Monero and ask yourself: Do you know even a single example of such a site about an interesting subject that is A) reasonably complete B) accurate, C) up-to-date, D) trusted and trustworthy, in short, is just the way you describe your ideal Monero info website in your post, but for another subject?

I claim you won't find any. Such websites do not exist, simple as that.

As somebody who already wrote a lot of documentation and made website about some particular, narrow fields I can tell you that there are many, many reasons for this absence.

Perhaps one of the most important reasons: Often the people with knowledge simply don't want to write documentation, and you can't force them.

Another important reason: Writing documentation is low reward work. It's mostly not fun because of that. People want to have fun however.

And one more: Things develop so fast that you can start to rewrite and revise something you write today already tomorrow, or in 2 days at the latest.

"In pretty much all forms of TA, if price action makes a low with great effort (volume) and doesn't get accepted with long term value, it should be expected to make a new high. 

Look at the monthly chart. It's doing just that. If we are to continue on the macro market, a retrace to around 140-150 will be the last opportunity for the ride up to 220 +

 I got a big bag at 102 during the binance delist because all I see is value. And if it does down down down, I don't care. This isn't a real investment so I'm not balls deep, but there isn't any practical reason monero can't be top5 without institutional investment as ordered by regulators. Look at what happened to gamespot and shit. 

Once the public sees the value, the use case, and the fear that comes out of the looming demon that is cbdcs, a 10 or 20x isn't even out of the question. For me I'm waiting for new all time highs. This year, next year, next bullrun, whatever. Simultaneously, when I want to buy stuff online, from new contact lenses to my medical prescriptions that can't be filled due to shortages, it's nice to have a way to do that. 

I'm not a criminal, but if I could use monero as my daily driver, I would. I don't want governments having any business in what I do, even though I have no shame. I mean we all jack off, and I'm no anomaly - but there's no reason the government should be looking in our windows to watch us.

 Monero just allows us the privacy to close them, should we so desire. (Or rather, closes them by default but you know what I mean) I don't comment here very often, but this community is great. Even when the project goes bearish, it was someone here who helped me realize that deregulation is bullish as fuck.

I accept Monero on r/sanpedrocactusforsale. More than that, I offer an automatic 10% discount on the subtotal to anyone who pays with Monero. Not a single person has chosen to pay with Monero. People not accepting it is clearly not the only issue; many places in the world have no viable way of purchasing Monero without extensive technical know-how. Haveno must be made vastly more accessible. 

>Even in the USA it is totally OK for people to sell their products directly for Monero without the buyer having to calculate any capital gains BS right?

Afaik the transfer would count as a sale, tax-wise, once it was transferred.

But if you bought $10 worth of Monero and then exchanged it for a product worth $10, I don't think you would need to report any capital gains, because you wouldn't have made any. If you bought $10 worth of Monero, let it accumulate in value to $15, then used that to purchase a product worth any amount of money, it would be capital gains because the Monero you used is worth more than when you purchased it.

Such a pledge is not what is needed.  More ways to be paid directly in monero is.  Someway to do crypto subscriptions would be useful as well.

"BCH has only about 13-15K transactions per day, while Monero has more than 30K.

BCH has these spikes to 100K daily, when they test various scripts and apps on the chain. But these are just tests, not actual use. 

I'd say Monero's price should be at least 2x of BCH price based on transaction count alone. Because Monero at least has a use case. Meanwhile, no DNM has and will never accept BCH. Despite everything, it still haven't found its place under the sun.

Also delistings: Monero shown it can survive the delistings, while they would be deadly to BCH.

Also, mining: Monero doesn't depend on mining farms which can be shut down or taken over by governments. And it's not a minority fork.

"As of now, Monero is structured in such a way that

* New coins are added to the blockchain through mining.
   * Any block is a combination of coinbase txs, on-chain txs, and nonce that surpasses a certain difficulty threshold.
      * A transaction is only ""confirmed"" after it's used to mine any block.

Let's do a thought experiment. Hypothetically, the transaction and block generation can be separated so that:

* Any tx will be accepted as long as it spends a valid input.
   * Instant tx confirmation, better scaling
* Block generation will only be miners competing for mining new coins.
   * A bit more mining efficiency achieved (assuming smaller blocks are faster to hash).
   * P2Pool will hypothetically be more efficient at mining as the total combination of txs + nonces is significantly higher (or less efficient?).

The major issue with this model is tx fee.

* We may ditch tx fee but then, it's wide open for flood attacks.
   * Is FCMP effective to prevent flooding in such a no-fee setup?

Is tx fee the sole reason that such hypothetical situation won't work? What are other weaknesses you can think of?",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5NDlfYUZ2UE9IRE9TYWlpdWxqQmh3cDUyU3BSUXBCaVpQUXV2aElYTDNHNjdYbHZ5UXNIdHhXWlo3VWpXSEF0R3dOLXIyNVpVcm5IZFRiRzBqcHlYUGc9PQ==

"The reason blocks exist in the first place is to create well-defined groups of transactions. Using them to distribute block rewards is a convenient side effect. Without blocks, nodes would quickly develop slightly different versions of history with slightly different transaction lists, which would result in newer transactions being rejected by some nodes due to spending unknown outputs, thus resulting in more differences between nodes, making the problem worse. Within minutes, the network would dissolve into thousands of tiny, incompatible networks with their own ideas of which transactions are valid.",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5cFpncUVwTXdUT2JPUWdKanlZd3FVRkRXVlNCRjhsSGgwVnEzNjU3bm5vTWtDaW41VVE1SEI3OEJvb1JDMDJvQS1NQk10QXQ5eTY4TWlnNEp4RWRCdGc9PQ==

"Monero is designed to generate a block every 2 min, right? The difficulty ensures that it remains to that level.

"Sadly, I've come to realize that BCH doesn't have an edge in anything.

Monero's adoption has no limit. BCH adoption will hit a brick wall once users realize their every transaction and wallet balance is fully traceable. CashFusion isn't real privacy, it's a band aid over a lost limb. A single server which can be taken down easily.

Monero's long term incentives are all figured out, while BCH will again hit a brick wall once block rewards dwindle and transaction count remains in the gutter (<15k daily). Unprofitable to mine, it will enter a death spiral of hashrate and relative price loss.

Monero mining is truly decentralized, anti-fragile, and follows Satoshi's original concept of 1 CPU = 1 Vote. BCH mining is very fragile, and depends on industrial-scale mining farms. There's just ONE (!) major producer of SHA256 ASICs, and that's Bitmain. The mining farms are an extremely easy target. They can be taken over by various governments in 24 hours, or simply bombed by drones, leading to unusable network. Adding insult to injury, BCH/BTC miners can choose to censor transactions if they are forced to do so by a non-government umbrella entity (FATF, BIS, ...).

If BCH manages to magically survive all that, the big money will just issue ETFs, and it's price growth will be safely tamed until block reward drops to peanuts. Meanwhile, ETF for Monero is basically impossible. No jurisdiction will ever allow it. This makes Monero long-term impenetrable to market manipulation.

BCH is a relic, outdated, and without a clear use case.

It makes me sad watching how their enthusiastic community thinks that building a skyscraper on top of a wooden foundation will make for a good home.",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5bEpSRzZBSlZKd2tXVnhXdGthZlBSSjNZR1N5WEFFR1FuTnJHYy1QZGVKbUxBNDcwcElNLU9QbGk5TkFieUI5c25tUk52Qkx1SkR1bUpMV1ZfYXJtLW5LOUZrVEZzcDZ5SXNyVWhNdElVdmc9

"I did not add any automated logging, and my immediate reaction is that doing so would be an unacceptable breach of privacy. Quick note that anyone can review the changes made to the github repo, there are not many of them. If users are willing to submit logs from any issues they experience that would be fantastic, and I would request that they run monerod with log level 2 to do so. There is not a log submission process in place right now, but it can certainly be created if there is interest.

Both a large volume of transactions and a significant number of connections are likely required to address the issues at hand. The primary goal is to have a sufficient number of connections for developer's nodes, thereby enabling them to perform effective debugging on their machines. The stressnet is intended to offer developers access to a robust network being driven to extremes. 

I have personally tried to reproduce the issues that some people saw during mainnet flooding by running a private testnet with 10 nodes on a single machine. Flooding that private testnet did not reproduce any issues, so the stressnet is the next logical next step in my mind. Even in the early stages of the stressnet I have already seen excessive memory use, and the approach has great promise in my opinion.",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2UjVyc2R6eUM1ZWtOc2gxazJvRmlhZXJ2WXhLQkNTeGh0SExhOVEwRElDbTlZMEgyeEktUHRnQzgtN1dKVjZPa1l6X0JhWk42NnU4M2RxTUExcGQtYWc9PQ==

Caveat: This is a well crafted, extensive list of all major exchanges dealing in Monero. If you can not find your go to exchange on this list treat it as ""extremely high risk"" and a potential scam. This list gets updated as new information becomes available. At the end you will find some recommendations for exchanges and wallets.

#USE CUSTODIAL CEX AKA ""CRYPTOBANKS"" WITH EXTREME CAUTION

Only day traders should use these third parties for their trading stack and ideally withdraw after closing a position. Newcomers should make themselves comfortable with hardware wallets before buying on a CEX and always and immediately withdraw, what they bought.

#USE NON-CUSTODIAL CEX AKA ""INSTANT SWAP EXCHANGES"" WITH CAUTION

Centralized instant swap exchanges which come with their own set of problems and risks can be a good way for many to route around CEX/CRYPTOBANKS.

Often those come with higher fees, shotgun KYC or are selective scams like ""Changelly"". 

Most of them depend on external liquidity (or are fronts for CEX), which means they will halt or freeze the exchange process just as often as CEX (main culprits are ChangeNow and FixedFloat). In times of bigger market movements many of those sites will abandon trades that are not favorable for them.

You can use an aggregator like **Trocador.app (🔒 .onion/i2p)** that has a security bond for transactions of up to $1000 and gives you a clear indication about competitive pricing and KYC risk. Other reputable resources to evaluate exchange risk are kycnot.me (🔒 .onion/i2p) and orangefren.com (🔒 .onion/i2p)

_____
Instant exchange risk | Non-custodial CEX | status
---|---|----
Extremely high ⚠️ + **Scam alert** ❌ | Changelly | selective scamming
Extremely high ⚠️ + KYC risk ⚠️ | ChangeNow | liquidity problems with long holds on funds, selective KYC scams
Extremely high ⚠️ | MajesticBank | inconsistencies / potential scam
Extremely high ⚠️ + KYC risk ⚠️ | Swapter | liquidity problems, potential selective scamming
Extremely high ⚠️ + KYC risk ⚠️ | FixedFloat | ⛔ operations closed, liquidity problems

#Satoshi taught us not to entrust our money with third parties.

> Not your key, not your coins


Crypto is all about control over your own money. If you don't self-custody, it means you entrust your stack, in some cases your life savings, with a third party that may or may not have ulterior motives, may or may not be a scam or may or may not be controlled or extorted by a rogue government.

The process of learning to become self-sovereign might include some pain. But as crypto history shows us, keeping ""your"" coins in the hands of a custodian is a 100% guarantee to set yourself and the community up for failure.

If you are in it for the gain, be smart and do it on-chain.


#What exchanges to use then?

There are plenty of better (more secure, private, trustless) however still more inconvenient solutions that are preferable over using KYC/CEX. Those often come at a higher price as security and privacy have a price, but not necessarily at a lower speed. Indeed starting from zero,  signing-up for a cumbersome and intimidating KYC process will often take days or weeks sometimes placing holds on funds while a DEX like Haveno will give you access to coins <1 hour and coming at the benefit of not giving up your right to privacy.


Exchange method | Exchanges| Trust level
---|---|----
DEX | Haveno (🔒 .onion), bisq (🔒 .onion) | ✅ escrow
P2P | Robosats, Paxful, ~~LocalMonero~~, ~~AgoraDesk~~| ✅ escrow
Atomic swaps | UnstoppableSwap.net, AtomicMonero, BasciSwapDEX, ~~Samourai Wallet~~ | ✅ trustless
AMM  (automatic market makers) | SeraiDEX| low for users / medium for liquidity providers (hacks)
Mining (""buy"" via electricity) | Gupax, XMRrig, Monero GUI | ✅ trustless
Earning (""buy"" via products and services) | any products or services | low - ⚠️ high (scams)


#What can you do?

If you are into cryptocurrencies for more than just some side gamble you really want to learn how to use the right tools to manage your money in a self-sovereign and self-custodial way. The more people learn about the risks involved and how to mitigate them the better for you and the health of the whole ecosystem.

#Self-sovereignity starts with the wallet you use.

*Be aware that different risks apply to the security of your operating system. Do not store significant amounts on desktop, mobile or web wallets! Always use an air gapped storage method for significant amounts.*

"Sadly besides the sd card slot and convenience the new Trezor model 5 does not really have any additional features compared to the model 3.

So I think right now the best hardware wallet for monero is the model 3 or 5. I would probably use the feather client together with it. You can use feather wallet on tails which I think increases security a tiny bit and privacy a lot in case you don´t run your own node.

Another cool product I recently found is the 'monero nodo'. Its an out of the box node.

I don't know if it's entirely a solution though, tariffs can help a country grow it's native companies. I think georgism predates the max influx of international shipping and trade. There are costs and benefits to tariffs of course, but in the long run it can help a nation grow an industry that is promising.

Then maybe those private organisations would pool their resources into a national road maintainer (for efficiency) and each have a member on the board of that company to protect their own interests.

The basic fundamental view of the Georgist movement as I understand it is not only that insofar as there be property taxes they be levied on land rather than improvements, it is not only that property taxes at some levels may be preferable to other kinds of taxes, but rather that property taxes should absorb essentially the whole rent of the land, leaving the market value of the land itself essentially zero, and that the revenue from that source should be the sole source for governmental expenditure.

I do not share those two views""

Bro what? nobody is talking about aluminum or saying you have to do anything. and it isn't a personal matter where a woke dude barges in and starts saying you have to do the greater good or he's going to tax you harder. I hope you know that we are probably pretty ideologically similar being on this subreddit. We are probably both libertarians and conservatively inclined. We like free markets and entrepreneurship and we both hate taxes. We also probably agree on that the government should stay out of our personal affairs.

And the fame level of the quote means that I can go and find the source of the quote easily, while yours could have been made up by someone like you who can't see anything other than black and white, communism vs capitalism. The fact is that a land value tax isn't any more socialist than any other tax, in fact it is more capitalist than income taxes and property taxes because it doesn't discourage economic growth.

Imagine you are a wealthy businessman with an average plot of land to house your business. You are an innovative entrepreneur who is providing a lot of value to your community. Your business is scaling and will continue to. Now imagine that the government knocks on your door saying they have noticed that you have made more money this year and so want to take more of it. Alternatively, they could knock and ask for the same small amount as every year prior, as you haven't purchased any new land. What would you prefer?

Incorrect. There are intelligent arguments against anarcho-capitalism, but it's clear that you don't know them; that you are speaking from a place of no understanding of the relevant economics; and furthermore that we have empirical examples of both statist and quazi-stateless societies which operated without taxation and/or provided the things you seem to foolishly believe are the difficult things to provide without taxes...I'm not even trying to argue from an ancap perspective; I'm just talking about bog-standard economic theory & evidence, where roads are already well-known and documented to be provided privately or as club goods, all over the world and througout history., education is almost fully a private good (with a tiny possible uncaptured positive extetnality component which government school systems in practice fail to capture).

Like, at least understand that what voluntary markets would have trouble providing would be high public goods like regional defense (e.g. an iron dome missile defense system can't just cover my house but not my neighbor's; non-rivalrous, non-excludable) or C02/particulate emissions (massive and dispersed negative externality to many 3rd parties not involved in an exchange which creates the pollution).

And beyond all this even, you have the always-ignored aspect of economics and fully 1/2 of the ancap critique of the state; and that's political economy - public choice.  
That is to say that we can claim and show market failures all day and opine about how bad things would be without taxes to produce goods that markets might fail to produce; but these stories always employ a nirvana fallacy- imagining an ideal government and political system which doesn't exist; and can't exist because of the intractably bad incentives which political systems create for voters, politicians, and bureacrats; and because of economic calculation problems; and also because market failure (in the technical economic sense) doesn't just plague voluntary markets, but also government action and political economies. And so it is possible (and likely!) that even when there is a real problematic market failure to correct; that having our actual governments and political systems attempt it, creates net costs or even worse problems than letting the undersupply of some good go or allowing over production of a negative externality.

So when you imagine that making the world a better place is as simple as a (truly) better tax - you need to also understand the political economy of the real world assessment and enforcement of that tax...which (despite being better from one side of the equation) may invoke large political externalities which at least weren't present with other, otherwise inferior, taxes.

In very fact, this is why thinkers like Glen Weyl and others have done much hand-wringing about how to get the assessment of an LVT out of the hands of our traditional local governments who are prone to rent-seeking and cronyism and corruption in their assessments. 
So Weyl proposes a system where people are only required to sell their property at the price at which they self-assess the value to be, and are taxed a fixed percentage of this value, so long as they hold the property.

This just scratches the surface of all the topics I just covered...there's a lot I don't know; but it's pretty clear that there's even more that you don't know; to the extent that you shouldn't be going around making these pronouncements.

Monero doesn't have any particular properties which promote any form of taxation at all, or demand that government provide any particular good which we (in our ignorance or wisdom) might think is necessary for it to produce...monero is just kinda a ""leave others the fuck alone"" money.

It's funny, you instantly assume you know what I'm thinking without even asking. Classic stupidity of someone stupid enough to leave a disrespectful comment like this. Nobody is asking for a perfect government when they say that one method of taxation is likely to be better than another. Yeah yeah governments are less efficient than the free market yeah yeah I know and agree you don't need to keep looking to appear smart.

>Keep your personal social engineering goals out of monero discussion...especially when you know so little of what you assert.

these last two parts lol. Monero does have some ""particular properties"" that promote certain forms of taxation, you're just an idiot. You can't place an income tax or a sales tax on Monero. You might think you can, but you're just stupid if you think that. The point of Monero is that nobody sees where your money goes. If the government could tax it, it would, and that is why there is a bounty on it right now.

Then the last part ""keep your social engineering goals out of monero discussion"" if you weren't acting so arrogant and thought you know everything about my intentions and knowledge, we could have a had a productive conversation. So how about this: Keep assuming that you are superior and that everyone is just a selfish piece of shit if you'd like people to hate conversing with you. You're doing a great job of both that and making a fool of yourself. OR you could cool off for a second, speak like an adult instead of a child, and we can probably learn something from each other.

"I have been thinking a lot about tail emissions.


I wonder if the amount of tail emissions right now might be too high.


And I especially worry that the amount of tail emissions should track the price of Monero, perhaps indirectly and low frequency. And therefore, the tail emissions limit the value of Monero.


My reasoning is somewhat similar to the stock-to-flow argument on bitcoin value


The amount of mining needs to scale along with technological advancement. But technological advancement is relatively static in relation to money. So a computer today might be 100 times more powerful than 2-3 decades ago, but the costs of those computers is fairly similar.


Tail emissions are there to reward mining, so that the can scale up as technology scales up. So, from the argument that relative computing power is quite static towards money, tail emissions should also be steady relative to money.


Therefore, if the price of Monero goes up, the number of tail emissions should go down. Otherwise, the community is inefficiently paying for more compute than a rational cost/benefit analysis would specify.


It also follows that the converse might be true. A too high amount of tail emissions could keep the price of Monero down, since mining is ultimately a commodity service and dictated by commodity prices for computing power.


All in all, I think for the long term there needs to be a mechanism to adjust the rate of tail emissions.


I don't yet know what the exact solution should be.
A simplistic proposal for illustrative purposes could be: every 2 years two separate CCS proposals to dictate whether tail emissions should be halved or doubled, with the CCS that receives the most XMR winning.


Perhaps others have better ideas.",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3YVYwdThKQTlGSVRwSzU0UHF4SkMwbDZra2c2aVZ2dW1hYWNwLXlvaXBQQ1BRTlJwT2NZMWx5cHJiM09KaDdBSzgtYjFfYzd3ajhrdEFtMG15aGYxaUE9PQ==
"And just to add an afterthought.


As a mechanism, tail emissions are similar to money creation by central banks or stock issuance by private company.


It dilutes the relative value of existing money/stock in order to achieve desired outcomes, such as (for central banks) price stability and economic growth or (for companies) company growth and debt management.


For central banks and companies, a panel of experts continuously adjusts the strategy to find the optimal balance.


In an analogue sense, tail emissions are a critical feature to achieve sufficient mining capacity on the long term.


But there is currently no process with the required knowledge and intelligence to determine the right level of mining that would achieve the desired outcome without unnecessarily diluting the value of the current Monero stock.
Dilution of value can also take the form of unnecessarily restricting the natural upwards trend in price.


Final after burner though: there are two competing incentives. Holders of existing Monero stock would like tail emissions to be as small as possible, to ensure price goes as high as possible. Miners would like the product of (tail emissions * price) to be as high possible.


This subtle difference in goals needs to be bridged in an intelligent way 


When tail emissions are too high (and price therefore too low), holders lose out most, while miners don't really benefit from the extra Monero due to the lower price, all else equal.",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3LVk4V2U4YkMzcEVYanVhNUUzUE5LTEhzMEVVVkw1TktFaUVEcEJ4aUFxNEhZR0xOM2FuaWptQ2JjOHVIbkN5YWJ5cFU0NnhGY2szOUdhLTctekNSaUE9PQ==

"Monero tail emission is fine as it is.

* Monero price is under manipulation for a long time now. There's no need to tie tail emission with fiat value and give the Big Brother Government more power.
* With a fixed tail emission, you can know exactly how much Monero will be in circulation at any point in the future. This stability prevents any negative impact against its supposed ""inflationary"" nature.
* Tail emission is there to incentivize miners to keep mining. Bitcoin that has tail emission and can't pay their miners. So, many individual miners are just shutting off their ASICs. This, in turn, makes Bitcoin mining more centralized. In that regard, even DOGE is unironically better at decentralization.
* Tail emission also ensures that there's enough liquidity in the market. It also helps the on-chain tx fee remain low.
* The hashrate of Monero is already correlated to its price ([source](https://moneroj.net/hashvsprice/)). When the price is high, more miners join the network. When the price is low, miners leave. On average, the price to hashrate ratio stays almost the same. So, no, miners aren't paying more than they make (except the hardcore believers and botnet whales).
* The difficulty adjustment takes care of technological advancement.
* Finally, Monero itself is supposed to be THE currency. Tying any part of it to the traditional fiat currency is not desirable.",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4NnRuMS1hVGxGYlpQcVpiLUZlaS01ckxsOVFEVjJNeHNRMGtXWVlYc3lfeTFHdmhOdWJscUw2cXFQS2NBT3Jzay1VOFZRaXNoOExad0NSY0RNRFN5aVE9PQ==

#USE CUSTODIAL CEX AKA ""CRYPTOBANKS"" WITH EXTREME CAUTION

Only day traders should use these third parties for their trading stack and ideally withdraw after closing a position. Newcomers should make themselves comfortable with hardware wallets before buying on a CEX and always and immediately withdraw, what they bought.

#USE NON-CUSTODIAL CEX AKA ""INSTANT SWAP EXCHANGES"" WITH CAUTION

Centralized instant swap exchanges which come with their own set of problems and risks can be a good way for many to route around CEX/CRYPTOBANKS.

Often those come with higher fees, shotgun KYC or are selective scams like ""Changelly"". 

Most of them depend on external liquidity (or are fronts for CEX), which means they will halt or freeze the exchange process just as often as CEX (main culprits are ChangeNow and FixedFloat). In times of bigger market movements many of those sites will abandon trades that are not favorable for them.

You can use an aggregator like **Trocador.app (🔒 .onion/i2p)** that has a security bond for transactions of up to $1000 and gives you a clear indication about competitive pricing and KYC risk. Other reputable resources to evaluate exchange risk are kycnot.me (🔒 .onion/i2p) and orangefren.com (🔒 .onion/i2p)

#Satoshi taught us not to entrust our money with third parties.

> Not your key, not your coins


Crypto is all about control over your own money. If you don't self-custody, it means you entrust your stack, in some cases your life savings, with a third party that may or may not have ulterior motives, may or may not be a scam or may or may not be controlled or extorted by a rogue government.

The process of learning to become self-sovereign might include some pain. But as crypto history shows us, keeping ""your"" coins in the hands of a custodian is a 100% guarantee to set yourself and the community up for failure.

If you are in it for the gain, be smart and do it on-chain.


#What exchanges to use then?

There are plenty of better (more secure, private, trustless) however still more inconvenient solutions that are preferable over using KYC/CEX. Those often come at a higher price as security and privacy have a price, but not necessarily at a lower speed. Indeed starting from zero,  signing-up for a cumbersome and intimidating KYC process will often take days or weeks sometimes placing holds on funds while a DEX like Haveno will give you access to coins <1 hour and coming at the benefit of not giving up your right to privacy.


Exchange method | Exchanges| Trust level
---|---|----
DEX | Haveno (🔒 .onion), bisq (🔒 .onion) | ✅ escrow
P2P | Robosats, Paxful, ~~LocalMonero~~, ~~AgoraDesk~~| ✅ escrow
Atomic swaps | UnstoppableSwap.net, AtomicMonero, BasciSwapDEX, ~~Samourai Wallet~~ | ✅ trustless
AMM  (automatic market makers) | SeraiDEX| low for users / medium for liquidity providers (hacks)
Mining (""buy"" via electricity) | Gupax, XMRrig, Monero GUI | ✅ trustless
Earning (""buy"" via products and services) | any products or services | low - ⚠️ high (scams)


#What can you do?

If you are into cryptocurrencies for more than just some side gamble you really want to learn how to use the right tools to manage your money in a self-sovereign and self-custodial way. The more people learn about the risks involved and how to mitigate them the better for you and the health of the whole ecosystem.

#Self-sovereignity starts with the wallet you use.

*Be aware that different risks apply to the security of your operating system. Do not store significant amounts on desktop, mobile or web wallets! Always use an air gapped storage method for significant amounts.*

"RandomX, by its very design, is ASIC proof. Trying to implement RandomX will inevitably create a full-fledge CISC processor. At that point, you're better off buying processors than trying to develop them yourself.

As for the massive hashrate shit, there's this [stripe miner](https://api.hashvault.pro/v3/monero/network/nonce/distribution/png?hashrate=true&nonceColor=%23ff6600) that you can see on the nonce map. When EU took down a massive botnet, this miner also coincidentally stopped mining. However, he's back again.

"When I came to know about this stripe miner's existence, I was paranoid that somehow Monero has a nonce bias. However, from what I learned, it seems like nonce pattern emerges as a result of using certain CPUs.

For example, check out this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/xzuzvf/where\\_do\\_this\\_pattern\\_in\\_the\\_nonce\\_distribution/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/xzuzvf/where_do_this_pattern_in_the_nonce_distribution/)

Here, experts can figure out what CPU a mining farm is using based on its nonce pattern.

As for why this miner is using this nonce pattern, no idea. It probably is more efficient for his bot farm to handle. It could also be the nonce pattern of Bitmain's Antminer X5. I saw them going on a huge sale some time ago.

As for banning the miner, how do you do so? Ban certain nonces? In a recent Monerotopia podcast, it was also discussed that mining is probably a less incriminating offense for a cybercriminal, so Interpol will less likely to act (assuming he's even traceable). Big governments are also incentivized not to take action because this miner is sabotaging Monero, a major enemy against the surveillance state.",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4RGx3VlhENVdOQVBSaV9fOUdCaElBQkZQVmp2bV9KQ1c0a19DOGRHZzVnMExUbkttT0ZQUUFLNjV3eWE2eWkzank4bDNGMDlheDN3NS1WWW0tNFRkQVE9PQ==

F2F:

Max. trade duration: 4 days / Max. buy: 48.00 XMR / Max. sell: 48.00 XMR / Account age: 32 days

">As you can release, a stripe miner uses non standard nonce pattern because he has a special equipment, call it “pseudo-asic”. This fact can be used to detect the malicious miner.

Is it because of special equipment? Or could it be because of different software? Maybe it's botnet software?

>Let make his life hard, because the miner is a criminal.

There's no real evidence of this. If he's using an ASIC then it's not illegal to make hardware. If he's using a botnet then sure, but you have no proof.

I don't know what we can do. RandomX mining is ""obvious"" so malware detection software could perhaps run checks for it from time to time? It's pretty hard to do anything at the protocol level.

"Monero has already been forced off of many/most exchanges.  If it ever has to go fully underground, f2f exchanges may become a very popular way to exchange it.

The community should be building these muscles now.  In particular it is useful to have infrastructure for coordinating initial meets:  advertising availability/services, finding/matching nearby parties, anonymous communication to arrange meetup, recommended meetup locations, etc.   reputations and ratings is also important to establish some level of trust.

A super important and oft overlooked aspect of building these muscles is what happens after the initial meetup.   Typically parties exchange contact info and may engage in future trades on ongoing basis.   Relationships and even friendships can form.  A human trading network develops that is completely outside the self-anointed gatekeepers.

The monero community should be building this human network NOW, not waiting until that is the only survival option.

In the early days Bitcoin had ""Satoshi Square"" meetups in cities around the world for f2f trading, and celebrated the idea with sites like localbitcoins.  Sadly that era as largely passed.

But it is an ethos/banner that should be much dearer to the monero community.

- How many XMR do you lose in the process of perma swapping currencies?

- How fast is it?

- And can you pay with SEPA or another easy Method?

I dont care about KYC, what I care about is the convinence. It seems like other exchanges (Kucoin and mexc) dont directly list XMR, instead you need to buy a different coin and then swap on the spot market, which would make using them obsolete.

"Well, I'm not disagreeing with you, but Satoshi's original idea before observing the emergent properties of the network was that all nodes participate in mining. So he would use ""node"" and ""mining node"" interchangeably. He envisioned that *mining nodes* would be commercial endeavors in big data centers, because he understood that to hash sha256 you get more bang for your buck with an application specific machine, which is true. And that's how it turned out. But regular nodes, I don't think he really thought much one way or another about that. He did say that the block size can be raised as needed, so definitely would not be a small blocker, but he also observed a few years after genesis that bitcoin as a protocol had ossified and was very difficult to change.

"What ~~deviation~~ *derivation* path do Trezor and ledger use for Monero, respectively?

And what derivation path is native Monero GUI app using?

Coinomi (which does not synch any more for Monero) uses

m/44'/128'/0'

How about Trezor?

I had 20000+ € in XMR on my Coinomi. Now I cannot access them any more. I restored Coinomi's 12 word seed in Trezor Safe 3 and connected my Trezor to Monero GUI native wallet in windows. The balance does not show up and the receive address is a different one.

How can I get hold of my XMRs?

m/44'/128'/0' (=M/44H/128H/0H)
I get the same RX address with this tool

While that is likely true it is also very reasonable to believe that quantum could affect Monero within many of our lifetimes.

The definition of a time bomb. The sooner quantum resistant steps are taken the sooner everyone will have real privacy.

"Thank you for sharing this  :)

I’m one of the developers, so if anyone has feedback/suggestions they are always welcome!

I’ll repost the linked post:

I wanted to post an exciting new update to the Atomic Swap UI that I've been working on at: https://www.atomicmonero.com

We've now added Ethereum to Monero Atomic Swaps (via the AthanorLabs ETH->XMR protocol). It's been live for several weeks and working great: https://www.atomicmonero.com/atomic-swaps/

We now offer:

Bitcoin to Monero Atomic Swaps

Ethereum to Monero Atomic Swaps

and are working on:

Monero to Bitcoin (reverse Atomic Swap)

Monero to Ethereum (reverse Atomic Swap).

Thank you to everyone who's used our service :) We've completed hundreds of Atomic Swaps during the past month. If anyone has any feedback please don't hesitate to let us know.

If you haven't yet then why not take a look? Our aim is to be an easy-to-use UI that leverages the power of Atomic Swaps - also a great place to recommend when friends & colleagues ask ""Where can I easily exchange my Bitcoin/Ethereum to Monero?"".

Donations

We've built all of this as volunteers, and even spent a large amount of our own funds. The reverse Atomic Swap services will require server upgrades, therefore all donations received so far have been greatly welcomed. If you like what you see then we'd love you to support us. (Without some level of donations it's possible we might not survive longer term.)

">ASICs are why Bitcoin is so secure.

That's hilarious. ASICs are why Bitcoin can be seized by governments whenever they want. A very few percent of people control the bitcoin network hashrate because ASICs are a naturally centralizing force.

>By the way, Satoshi knew that bitcoin would ultimately be mined by large farms of ASICs. Mining with ASICs was always the end goal. Satoshi knew that as the network grew beyond a certain point, mining would be left more and more to large farms of application specific integrated circuits. Satoshi literally said this on the 3rd of November 2008, just two months before he launched Bitcoin.

Lets give you that Satoshi said this, so what? Is your argument that satoshi is omniscient?

2008 was a long time ago. Are we really going to pretend that people knew better in 2008 when there have been plenty of developments in computer science since then?

>""At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.""

>Satoshi Nakamoto

Ok, now lets not give you the benefit of the doubt, can you at least prove that this is the case? Why should I believe he said this?

Meanwhile, in the bitcoin whitepaper it is stated

>Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains

Contradicting you. So which is to be believed? The official bitcoin whitepaper, or whatever source you got this from?

>ASIC resistance is why it's not profitable to mine XMR at home.

Yes, because ASIC resistance democratizes mining to anyone with a CPU. If the total amount of money available from mining goes up, more miners can easily join the network. If it goes down, people can easily leave the network without losing their hardware investment. Plus, many people mine even though it's unprofitable because of ideological reasons.

Meanwhile having ASICs turns mining into a system where only those with giant farms can produce the monetary supply. Sounds pretty antithetical to a ""financial revolution"" if you ask me.

Bitcoin mining is only profitable because Bitcoin is expensive AND because people are unable to join the network without investing massive amounts of resources, which means the hashrate cannot follow the price upwards as easily (but of course can follow downwards if mining conglomerates decide they are not in profit).

>ASIC resistance is why most of Monero's hashrate comes from mining malware that is illegally installed on peoples' servers without their knowledge or permission.

This does happen, but do you have any proof that this accounts for ""most"" or even a significant percent of Monero's hashrate? Operation Endgame recently took down a bunch of bots, so where is the giant crash in hashrate?

You claim this is why XMR is unprofitable to mine, and that hashrate instability is because of this, but it's simply unsubstantiated.",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEZ1lLWWNRQ0JILXhHc3QyaGVMcHFVMWtGb0lqTkF6VV9PY3FTbmFCMUNHM2ptOFA2SFpzbVpTR3F0Tm1KeUZIOFQ1SFF1U0s1U21tbHh3Yk0ybUdRSGc9PQ==
">What if botnets start to use peer2pool? I'm actually happy with their presence tbh.

I find it unlikely that they would use p2pool. It would require a machine to host the pool 24/7 which would likely increase detection rates.

So they either convert one of the bots into a p2pool node and hope that the node doesn't get shutdown over and over, or they rent a VPS and turn that into a node. Both seem like a waste of time if you could just direct your bots all at one pool.

Maybe if big pools start rejecting miners that don't use xmrig proxy when they have 100s of 200h/s miners then they would be forced to use p2pool since it's the same amount of work. It probably does waste pool resources to accommodate botnets anyways.",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNETmxGNUxURkVXZFJNX05BMEdRaUNZUjh1WldkS1NPOG1aOFhscGNOdS0zTEllQ2psNUVLeHBqQV9rRGRIaHVIUW1nbDYzOWxlQkR0bERWSXN4Z09LakE9PQ==

">they never hold the coins themselves

What I've read about the web-ui on their site directly contradicts this. If the swap is not performed by your browser through something like wasm, it means the swap is performed on their server. Atomic swaps need some level of interaction so they would have to have the spend key for both sides of the atomic swap wallets aka they have direct custody over the coins and any claim that they don't is plain wrong. This also means that they definitely can freeze funds from swaps done through the web-ui.

">While I partly agree with your points on zcash I think the project is trying to go in a more decentralized direction.

I think it's too little too late. The supply distribution is centralized, so the staking will always be centralized too. It's also developed by a company, so it's not worth looking at in my opinion.

>About the technology - while I don't know the details well enough to be sure - it feels like zcash devs are more dynamic in improving the protocol, while Monero's promised core upgrades - for whatever reason - feel like they are taking forever.

The technology behind zcash is indeed newer, and I don't really want to shit on it too much because I find it interesting, but it's also not really trustworthy and easily implemented incorrectly (which, they admit has been an issue in the past).

Monero has more at risk with each upgrade, there are more people actually using Monero. Changes need to be peer reviewed and cannot fail when they're pushed. It also doesn't help that the development is funded through donations to a small number of people who are willing to work on the project.

It's pretty hard for someone to work on a project promising radical privacy without the worry that they will be screwed over like the tornado cash devs.

>About the consensus - PoW VS PoS - and the default anonimity, I don't think there's a necessary winner. We can discuss on that, but you frame it as if there's a stricly better option (monero) without explaining why.

Proof of stake is definitely worse if the supply is already centralized into a for profit company. 

If we're talking strictly about decentralization, mining with CPUs is more decentralized versus having to run a staking node. It makes sense for chains like ethereum, though they were getting worried about censorship, but it does not make sense for chains such as Monero where the goal is to maximize decentralization.

There's also something to be said about how staking just encourages you to hoard money, which is not a positive thing. It also means that the richest people control consensus over the network. I would be whole heartedly against a conversion towards PoS for Monero.

As for default anonymity, there is definitely a clear winner. Since zcash does not have default anonymity it results in most transactions being public. Nobody uses confidential transactions. That's a big issue, because even if your obfuscation is mathematically perfect, it doesn't matter if you're the only one using it. 1 ZEC goes in, 1 ZEC minus transaction fee comes out, it's pretty obvious to the human eye who's who (nevermind other mathematical methods of correlation). 

There is no real reason to not have default anonymity besides trying to appease regulators to try and artificially boost token prices. Clearly too little too late though, since they often get delisted alongside Monero. Regulators are not our friends, they don't want people to have anonymity or privacy or any sense of self sovereignty.",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFbTVBRkZwOWpZeWVGQ2F2SzQtOUtDWmxmeUgzbEN6dU15WEptXy1pSThYR1FSeTlIakhucW1CelNoQ1RRc2ppUHp4U1lsZUEtNG9qd1R0SmQyZkk1V2c9PQ==

"1) Centralization is a vague concept: in network science there are countless different concepts of centralization and as many ways to measure it.
A foundation isn't a for profit company. Monero is just not a legal entity while a foundation is. This introduces an element of centralization, but being the code open, nothing prevents users from hard forking.
Monero doesn't even have a DAO: for you it is a plus, but at the same time you notice the drawbacks of a weak management structure.
Who is coding what, in Monero & why should I trust that it's going to be shipped at time T and work?
If things go south code-wise or anything else, who is responsible? Who has a ""stake"" in the game - except the ideological one which is based purely on trust?

2) I don't know the intricacies of the Tornado cash case, but IMO there's more than the simple ""criminalizing code that can be ill-used"" that we tell each other in the crypto space.
If you're just writing code, you might be told to stop, but you shouldn't go to jail or even pay fines. But maybe I'm just naive...

3) Mining EXCLUSIVELY with low-end CPUs is indeed more decentralized but it also impacts the capacity of the network: Monero can't scale much, neither in TPS nor in speed to finality.
Is this advantage in decentralization more relevant than the drawbacks? I wouldn't be so sure. Regarding Bitcoin i.e. being able to use specialized HW, PoW can lead to centralization.

4) Regarding default anonimity I'd agree that default anonimity and the chance to opt out is better, but I'm trusting you on how this works in zcash cause I've never used it.",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFd2M5a0lJSnJEZzE0a0RzS25xcXBsZnFIcDVROHFxR0FrejB4a2lzem1hT0JBSHRxeHJLWXgyZnlhZDNfUGdic1RkQm1qR0h6MTlFc2toLXRYd3VVR2c9PQ==

So the real XMR payout to your wallet every 3 days is not good enough for you? You'd rather watch an ""XMR balance"" number on pool dashboard go up, which isn't real XMR in your wallet, and is only promised to be paid to you, eventually, after a week or two of mining. IF the pool doesn't go down, or pool admin doesn't decide to rug pull their users.

">This introduces an element of centralization, but being the code open, nothing prevents users from hard forking.

This is nice in theory but not really true in practice. The existence of a centralizing organization means they control much of the consensus, so even when the zcash foundation makes bad changes there is nobody to really challenge them. If you go against them, nobody is going to follow you because the organization both has massive presence in their coin's ecosystem and there are very few people interested in the coin.

With Monero, generally the devs make good decisions so there are almost no offshoot forks. If however the next hard fork introduced changes that went against the general ethos of the project, you would see rioting in this subreddit and numerous developers going against the changes.

>Monero doesn't even have a DAO: for you it is a plus, but at the same time you notice the drawbacks of a weak management structure.

It is a plus for me. The idea of a DAO simply hides centralizing elements of developing decentralized software. It doesn't really achieve anything.

No, the reason that ZCash has a strong management structure is because there is a unified organization that employs people with their coins that they basically steal from the consensus mechanism. It's pretty easy to get dev resources when you can throw around money. The fact that the take a cut from the consensus (which, I thought was 10% but apparently it's 20%) is enough for me to disregard the project. It's a scam.

>Who is coding what, in Monero & why should I trust that it's going to be shipped at time T and work?

That's the thing, nobody is forced to contribute to Monero besides people who were funded by donations. The fact that devs for the project are not one entity means that the project is more resistant to hijacking or negative changes. This results in work being done at unknown times, sure, but if that's a problem then you can either fund more dev work or work on stuff yourself.

It's the same model that other FOSS projects like linux work on.

>If things go south code-wise or anything else, who is responsible? Who has a ""stake"" in the game - except the ideological one which is based purely on trust?

You could say the same thing about security vulnerabilities in linux. the people who made the mistake are generally responsible.

The difference is that Monero has cryptography audits, so the auditors are also at fault. Obviously some of the devs have money in Monero from mining when the project started, so they have stake in the success of the project.

It's also pretty hard to commit so much time (and get paid to do so) just to not care about the success of something.

>I don't know the intricacies of the Tornado cash case, but IMO there's more than the simple ""criminalizing code that can be ill-used"" that we tell each other in the crypto space. If you're just writing code, you might be told to stop, but you shouldn't go to jail or even pay fines. But maybe I'm just naive...

I don't think this is true at all. They were charged for facilitating money laundering, but it's not like they control who can use their mixing service. The government just came down hard on them to send a message.

>Mining EXCLUSIVELY with low-end CPUs is indeed more decentralized but it also impacts the capacity of the network: Monero can't scale much, neither in TPS nor in speed to finality.

This is not really true. Mining on low-end CPUs and high-end CPUs makes no difference to how much Monero can scale, it just changes the difficulty for the PoW challenge.

We could change the block time to 30 seconds if we wanted, it just means that the reward would need to be cut in 4. Putting this too low means that there is more of a chance for the chain to split temporarily, but this is more of an issue with getting the new information to all nodes rather than insufficient mining power. That's what happens when you try to make a decentralized system. If we had one big authoritative server that relayed the transactions then the TPS could be really high, but that's not cryptocurrency.

If every node was updated with the next block immediately then this wouldn't be an issue, but obviously the internet has latency issues.

Adding more mining power doesn't change this though, it has nothing to do with it.",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFNTRlaURPTjJMeWtIVWJZQ19nTmRObkthdHdrdnZ4Vl9VY1U1XzJrYUpGU0ZzRTRaV0ZMem1XRUI4eloxTGp0eDUyTklBdktGZ00wZjFtWk41eER4Vnc9PQ==

"What you're talking about is enticing miners. What I'm talking about is how the network fundamentally operates. As long as there's a weakness, it will be exploited, especially in the case of Monero.

* Monero already had a bounty on its head from IRS. So, the state is a threat actor.
   * Assume that the state is still working behind the scenes to undermine Monero (delistings, price manipulation, etc.).

As long as solo mining is available, we can't stop 51% attacks.

I mean, just look at the [top pools](https://miningpoolstats.stream/monero) (supportxmr, nanopool, hashvault). They control way more than 51% of the network's hashrate. As long as solo mining is available, there's nobody stopping them from colluding and performing a 51% attack.

* They can easily pull off a double-spend attack.
* They are free to choose what tx to include in their blocks.

In contrast, if they were forced to be on P2Pool, they're free to collude as much as they want... the network will enforce them to mine at the top height (no double-spend attack possible). Their ability to include/exclude their preferred txs is also dramatically reduced (no tx censorship + chain bloat by including their own spam only).

Let's say with their combined hash power, they deprive all the other P2Pool miners.

"This thread contains some wrong information. To put this straight, please consider this:

Quote from ""https://www.getmonero.org/de/resources/moneropedia/viewkey.html"" (I translate it into English):

*[...] Each Monero Address has a shareable private View-Key. By sharing the View-Keys, somebody else can see the* ***incoming transactions*** *of this address. However, outgoing transactions can (as of June 2017) NOT be shown reliably. Therefore,* ***one should not rely on the balance shown with a View-Key of a Monero address.***

Above formulation is in fact even a bit too positive. The full truth is even worse: Let's compare

(a) a View-Only wallet (which has all keys except the private spend key) with

(b) the corresponding ""full wallet"".

Indeed any outgoing transactions are missing in (a). But what is more: wallet (a) also shows incoming (receive) transactions that never actually occurred! More precisely, wallet (a) turns outgoing transactions into incoming transactions, thereby letting the total balance shown grow instead of shrink.

For example, on one day in 2016 the actual transaction (acc. to (b)) was two outgoing transactions of 0.72 and 0.95 XMR, respectively.

But in wallet (a), these are shown as INCOMING transactions of 3.85 XMR and  2.45 XMR, respectively. So instead of reducing the balance, the balance is even wrongly increased! Technically, this apparently stems from the fact that only the back-transfer (the change) of an outgoing transaction is shown in (a), wheras (b) correctly displays the difference between outgoing amount minus the returning incoming change.",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFSDVIZm9tZXhxYzhSSlZIdjB0d0dxY3hRT2w4TkVvTUpSamdnekdYWDF6azdfeEJxSjVxbmNrd1NLVU1GUXB3Y0pmYWlQdi14WkVvV1g3eXZkQmN6bFE9PQ==

"I disagree on some points. This notion that we’re “early” is true to some extent but the timelines are too far out. Let’s look at SWIFT for example and I’ll double back on Monero. 

The deadline for SWIFT to fully enable ISO 20022 for cross-border payments is November 2025. SWIFT began enabling ISO 20022 messages for cross-border payments businesses on an opt-in basis in August 2022, and migration began more widely in March 2023. During the transition period, which lasts until November 2025, banks will still be able to send messages on the existing MT standard. 

Here are some deadlines for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) that have been announced:

Brazil
The Banco Central do Brasil (BCB) originally planned to launch its CBDC, Drex, by the end of 2024, but delays may push the launch back to early 2025.

SWIFT
The global bank messaging network SWIFT plans to launch a platform that connects CBDCs to existing financial systems within 12–24 months. The platform aims to make CBDCs from different countries interoperable, which could reduce risks to the payments system.

Digital euro
The ECB's investigative phase for the digital euro ended in 2023, and a preparation phase is scheduled to begin in November 2023 and last at least two years. This phase will focus on finalizing rules, selecting providers, and testing

As of October 2023, 11 countries have launched CBDCs, 21 have pilot programs, and 79 are developing or researching them. However, progress on retail CBDCs in the US has stalled, and as of June 2024, the US Federal Reserve has not decided to issue a CBDC.

BRICS
Brazil 🇧🇷 Russia 🇷🇺 India 🇮🇳 China 🇨🇳 South Africa 🇿🇦 
Has 97 new applicants which is roughly HALF of the global population. Let that sink in… On 1 January 2024, BRICS – the intergovernmental organisation admitted four new members: Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦 is rumored to join now that the 50 year Nixon Petrol Dollar agreement has ended. 

Let’s shift towards the top 5 priorities of Agenda 2030.

The value of transactions processed via central bank digital currency or CBDC is forecast to grow by 260,000 percent between 2023 and 2030. This is according to a market estimate made in early 2023, based on various conditions and sources available at that time. 24 Central Banks will have digital currencies by 2030… CBDC transactions are expected to exceed $213 billion by 2030 as well. 

Are we catching onto the timeline yet? 

15 retail CBDCs are expected by 2030 according to BIS. 

The top 5 priorities of agenda 2030 

The Global Goals and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development seek to end poverty and hunger, realise the human rights of all, achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, and ensure the lasting protection of the planet and its natural resources.

All of which they will control with the use of CBDCs, Digital IDs, Universal Basic Income and Social Credit Scores… I haven’t even touched in the next “Plandemic” Mass Surveillance / Censorship, A.I, the Fed, the Global Economy, Global Conflicts or the WEF’s agenda. 

Hopefully the overall picture and use case for Monero is clearer. Yes we are early but the dangers of some of these agendas are right around the corner. Things are developing at an accelerated rate by the day. 

The United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is serious about tracking cryptocurrency transactions and is now offering a $625,000 bounty to anyone who can track Monero’s privacy coins—as well as trace transactions on Bitcoin’s (BTC) Lightning Network.

Monero’s ATH is $517 I believe… It will more than likely reach 1K or beyond during this bull run. *This is NOT financial advice. 

Privacy is NOT a crime… Governments are to serve the people, it’s NOT the other way around. Look at the levels of overreach that they pushed for in 2020.

"Fork & Dev

Forking doesn't mean you lose your coins in the ""official"" version. It means that the official version isn't necessarily the ""good"" one. Plus, what you're saying sounds like ""who starts with more money/control, inevitably wins in terms of network effect"", which is clearly false.

You reinforce my point about the drawbacks of the absence of a mgmt structure: there are contextual advantages and disadvantages; claiming that one is better in general doesn't make sense. The comparison with Linux doesn't make sense too, because Linux has countless forks with possibly lots of undiscovered potential exploits. The forks of Linux used in production and critical systems are mostly those created or maintained by for profit companies and other reputable entities.

Tornado cash

>The government just came down hard on them to send a message.

While I understand this framing, unless there's evidence (you could FOIA the prosecutors to prove your point I guess) all that is left is the sentence and the process proceedings. Which, anyone would have a hard time proving they show that the purpose was to ""send a message"" and not simply ""apply the law"".

Mining Pow VS Pos

My point is that with PoS you have levels of TPS and finality provably as high as those required by a credit card service. With centralized high end CPU mining you can probably achieve something a tad less perfoming. With low end CPUs you are very decentralized but your service can't scale much & is slow compared to the standards of an internet connected economy.

"I agree, but with a caveat.

There’s a belief that if the public understood the importance of privacy and financial anonymity, Monero would become the leading cryptocurrency. Some think that in 20-30 years, Monero will be as widely accepted as cash.

While I agree with the timeline, I disagree with the broader implication. Most people, by nature, prioritize convenience and safety over privacy and freedom.

I believe Monero will never be widely traded in any developed country. Instead, it will likely become the de facto currency for resource-rich countries in South America, Africa, and Asia that are seeking alternatives to the dollar and yuan due to global political pressures.

These are the regions where Monero has a genuine purpose, and the population doesn’t need to be convinced of its value.

"In my opinion, monero will not make you rich. Sure it can be somewhat deflationary compared to fiat and maybe you will not lose money or even make some profit but it will not make you rich.
The problem is that many people who missed on btc are trying to get rich now with xmr 😂. That's not how it works.
Money is anonymous cash. In my opinion it will never be main stream. This argument ""we are too early"" is just BS. You either use it or don't. It doesn't make sense to buy and hold it for 40 years, my god!
If you are here to get rich then you didn't understand it correctly, although it would be a nice side effect for sure 👍
Fact is that we don't know what will happen in the future. Sure they might be a very small chance that will lead to monero becoming main stream, but I personally don't see it.

Monero is an “Insurance Policy” if you will against Government and Banking Overreach. It’s the Ace of Spades that’s in your back pocket.

This came after Canada making a U turn on gun right… Something that we’re going though now in the US. China has complete control over their citizens via Social Credit scores and we’re now beginning to see the rollout of Universal Basic Incomes in the US on a state by state (mostly democratic) basis.

"I mean i would have said the main benefit of monero to me is the price is stable. it can be used as actual currency and not worry its going to drop a lot etc..

the original premise of crypto was to replace money because its decentralised. if it was to be a genuine contender as useable currency but keeps rising in value it causes major issues like deflation.

stable price is the pinnacle of what you want.

people can convert USD to monero, keep it as monero, not lose actual value of their savings. or it rises in line with inflation. it acts as money should. but decentralised.

funnily probably nobody in the community here actually wants this though they want profits.

You then go on about wanting people to post cash to randomers for Monero, especially with whom they don't know? This type of content truly gives the currency a bad reputation. No rational person would ship thousands of dollars in an envelope.

"Nice comment! Full of facts and I agree with your opinions.   
  
Thinking about the IRS, a $625k bounty actually doesn't sound that serious. We are in the early days of adoption and I expect crypto to ramp up a lot in 10 years, and that bounty may go up with it. More importantly, when it comes to them tracking transactions, I honestly wonder how the IRS is going to do this when certain people make 100 txs or more per day, have dozens of wallets, and many txs across apps that aren't US-based or even on the radar yet in a vast growing ecosystem that even ai would struggle to keep up with. Not to mention that most of their engagement in DeFi probably lacks any form of KYC.  
Of course IRS agents themselves could never sort through every US citizens transactions fully and determine their actual gains, but I honestly doubt they could get far leveraging ai, even. Not to mention the fact that nobody owes them anything in the first place because the IRS taxes people based upon their citizenship which is a corporate contract that they never agreed to in the first place...

My guess is that each individual is on their own personal journey of self-realization and will be handled wherever they are at.

">Forking doesn't mean you lose your coins in the ""official"" version. It means that the official version isn't necessarily the ""good"" one.

Well obviously, but any chain that isn't the one maintained by the zcash foundation will become a ghost chain. The point is that you have really no power in deciding what happens to the coin when they control essentially all of the discourse around it. There is zero chance that there would be any momentum against any bad changes they make.

>Plus, what you're saying sounds like ""who starts with more money/control, inevitably wins in terms of network effect"", which is clearly false.

Proof of stake rewards you with respect to how much money you have. The devs of zcash get 20% of all staking rewards. They will control more of the supply than anyone else.

The devs literally control a disproportionate share of consensus and share of the rewards. There is no real point in considering zcash anymore, nobody wants to adopt a currency like this with such terrible economics.

>You reinforce my point about the drawbacks of the absence of a mgmt structure: there are contextual advantages and disadvantages; claiming that one is better in general doesn't make sense.

This is not true at all. When it comes to basically anything else it's better to have a management structure, but when it comes to cryptocurrencies you cannot have a management structure without centralizing the project.

Having a management structure means that there is one entity that does all (or almost all) development. It means that there is basically no push back when this entity makes a bad decision. It's entirely unacceptable for a decentralized currency project.

>The comparison with Linux doesn't make sense too, because Linux has countless forks with possibly lots of undiscovered potential exploits.

The comparison does make sense in that linux is developed by volunteers with no expectation of delivery. I wasn't comparing the type of software being developed, because that doesn't make sense. A fork on linux is inconsequential. There is also probably never going to be formal verification for the linux kernel, so of course there will be exploits, formal verification takes a long time and the linux kernel is giant.

We were talking about development methods. Within the context of development methods it's a good comparison.

>The forks of Linux used in production and critical systems are mostly those created or maintained by for profit companies and other reputable entities.

Which isn't a contradiction. In Monero we have projects that work on their own stuff (for example cake wallet) which contribute back to the project. It's not really different than what goes on in linux.

In linux, companies make their own forks and then people take the stuff made by these companies and put it back into other linux forks.

In Monero, companies make their own projects and then give back code relating to other projects (or the main monero core project).

The existence of companies in the ecosystem doesn't imply some unified centralized management system.",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGT2ZRSzNiM0JZVzV5OXBkZXI5cVVjU0YweDlxSGt6enhKaDZLTU5vQVkxdlhEb2pPaGctUnFPM0o2RF9xQWI1Q3pUbzB3YVJIZEZ5alh5MkFycElqdEE9PQ==

I'll just drop the tornado cash argument, if you think the US government works for ""justice"" then I can't convince you otherwise. It's already over with regardless of what we think.

**Pos**

>My point is that with PoS you have levels of TPS and finality provably as high as those required by a credit card service.

I don't think you really understand what you're talking about. There is no increase in TPS that comes from proof of stake. 

If you have a limit on how much data can be stored in each block, you have a limit on TPS.

If you have a limit on how many blocks can be created per second, you have a limit on TPS.

Proof of stake solves neither of these things. Just making the chain proof of stake doesn't mean you can add terabytes of data to the chain, and it doesn't mean you can make it so that you can produce a block every minute

Nothing particular to proof of stake improves finality either. The main issues with finality are whether or not a transaction will be revoked. Transactions can potentially be revoked on PoS just like they can be on PoW by an attacker, but that isn't really the main concern with finality. The idea that someone will try to attack a chain to reverse transactions is silly in either case.

The real issue is a chain split, which has nothing to do with PoS or PoW and has everything to do with how fast you can update each node with the current chain state. I believe DAGs solve this though, but aren't unique to any consensus method.

The point of cryptocurrencies is not to recreate the current financial system. If you're trying to do that, decentralization has to give, so there is no point in doing it in the first place. You might as well start a fintech company.

>With centralized high end CPU mining you can probably achieve something a tad less perfoming. With low end CPUs you are very decentralized but your service can't scale much & is slow compared to the standards of an internet connected economy. Again: claiming that one is strictly better, sounds simplistic.

There is nothing inherently centralizing about ""high end CPU mining"" versus ""low end CPU mining""

You aren't going to be able to make enough money mining on a CPU for it to be worthwhile to create some centralized ASIC warehouse like people do with bitcoin. That's the whole point of avoiding ASICs, it means that more people can mine with their already existing hardware and therefore the difficulty is more fluid and attached to the price. Someone trying to create a mining warehouse for Monero is going to be at a disadvantage.

Now the other part of this that doesn't make sense is why you think less hashrate = can't scale.

Scaling has literally nothing to do with how many CPUs (high end or not) are on the network. The only thing that this effects is the difficulty, nothing else.

If we had 100x as many CPUs it would not make the block time change, If we had 100x less CPUs (or hashing power, same thing) it would also not make the block time change. The block time is hard coded to tend to 2 minutes. We could change that to something else, but that's a different discussion.

The reason that cryptocurrency chains do not have 0.1 second block times is because you need to update the nodes in the network on the current state. When a block is found, everyone needs to be informed about this. If we have short blocks then there can be issues where one node doesn't understand that it's behind.

What does fix this is the advancement of high speed internet. Nodes need to be connected over the internet with as little delay as possible. This isn't unique to PoW or PoS though.",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGSFRTY09fempETjNXbjVwbzNac2xRMHZzTWRCVjFnaEdTVjdqNUtmQnZuSXNUbHdZTzltb19BRXRGdDBGOHV0SENnVnpuQ29JbVZUU25EdmJMNGZsV0E9PQ==

"[GitHub - retoaccess1/haveno-reto: Decentralized P2P exchange built on Monero and Tor](https://github.com/retoaccess1/haveno-reto)

This is the Monero Reto networked verison of Haveno.  You can click the big ""GREEN TAG CURRENT RELEASE"".  I would say this is long term going to be the best option for most who want to use Monero p2p  
  
1. Download [executable.zip](http://executable.zip)  
2. Install and run  
3. set up deposit account and make an offer for XMR

The only caveat I see to new people for this is most buys require a security deposit in XMR which may be an obstacle for new users.

Another option now is [bitpapa.com](http://bitpapa.com)  
This is the new [localmonero.co](http://localmonero.co) hosted by Russians.  Seems legit.

Another option is Bisq if you have BTC to use as a deposit.  Haveno is a fork of Bisq so I'd recommend learning to use Haveno Asap.

#USE CUSTODIAL CEX AKA ""CRYPTOBANKS"" WITH EXTREME CAUTION

Only day traders should use these third parties for their trading stack and ideally withdraw after closing a position. Newcomers should make themselves comfortable with hardware wallets before buying on a CEX and always and immediately withdraw, what they bought.

#USE NON-CUSTODIAL CEX AKA ""INSTANT SWAP EXCHANGES"" WITH CAUTION

Centralized instant swap exchanges which come with their own set of problems and risks can be a good way for many to route around CEX/CRYPTOBANKS.

Often those come with higher fees, shotgun KYC or are selective scams like ""Changelly"". 

Most of them depend on external liquidity (or are fronts for CEX), which means they will halt or freeze the exchange process just as often as CEX (main culprits are ChangeNow and FixedFloat). In times of bigger market movements many of those sites will abandon trades that are not favorable for them.

You can use an aggregator like **Trocador.app (🔒 .onion/i2p)** that has a security bond for transactions of up to $1000 and gives you a clear indication about competitive pricing and KYC risk. Other reputable resources to evaluate exchange risk are kycnot.me (🔒 .onion/i2p) and orangefren.com (🔒 .onion/i2p)

#Satoshi taught us not to entrust our money with third parties.

> Not your key, not your coins


Crypto is all about control over your own money. If you don't self-custody, it means you entrust your stack, in some cases your life savings, with a third party that may or may not have ulterior motives, may or may not be a scam or may or may not be controlled or extorted by a rogue government.

The process of learning to become self-sovereign might include some pain. But as crypto history shows us, keeping ""your"" coins in the hands of a custodian is a 100% guarantee to set yourself and the community up for failure.

If you are in it for the gain, be smart and do it on-chain.


#What exchanges to use then?

There are plenty of better (more secure, private, trustless) however still more inconvenient solutions that are preferable over using KYC/CEX. Those often come at a higher price as security and privacy have a price, but not necessarily at a lower speed. Indeed starting from zero,  signing-up for a cumbersome and intimidating KYC process will often take days or weeks sometimes placing holds on funds while a DEX like Haveno will give you access to coins <1 hour and coming at the benefit of not giving up your right to privacy.


Exchange method | Exchanges| Trust level
---|---|----
DEX | Haveno (🔒 .onion), Bisq (🔒 .onion) | ✅ escrow
P2P | Bitpapa, Robosats, Paxful, ~~LocalMonero~~, ~~AgoraDesk~~| ✅ escrow
Atomic swaps | UnstoppableSwap.net, AtomicMonero, BasciSwapDEX, ~~Samourai Wallet~~ | ✅ trustless
AMM  (automatic market makers) | SeraiDEX| low for users / medium for liquidity providers (hacks)
Mining (""buy"" via electricity) | Gupax, XMRrig, Monero GUI | ✅ trustless
Earning (""buy"" via products and services) | any products or services | low - ⚠️ high (scams)


#What can you do?

If you are into cryptocurrencies for more than just some side gamble you really want to learn how to use the right tools to manage your money in a self-sovereign and self-custodial way. The more people learn about the risks involved and how to mitigate them the better for you and the health of the whole ecosystem.

#Self-sovereignity starts with the wallet you use.

*Be aware that different risks apply to the security of your operating system. Do not store significant amounts on desktop, mobile or web wallets! Always use an air gapped storage method for significant amounts.*

Debit cards that ran on there own network and the network portals at business where free and net based with VPN protection .  With every day that goes by the more people lose complete trust in central bank currencies and the way any gov spends or collects the money they work for.  Right now XMR trades around what Solana does and the only thing I see about Solana is it's ability to host 100 scams a day .  Being able to build other applications off XMR prevents everything that would make the above possible if it was it would be worth more than Bitcoin and XMR would be widely used by more than politicians to accept bribes.

"I can see how it could be attractive to Luigi to have an employee type person around (see Taleb's blog post [https://medium.com/incerto/how-to-legally-own-another-person-4145a1802bf6](https://medium.com/incerto/how-to-legally-own-another-person-4145a1802bf6)). More expensive (like the $100k/year equivalent rehrar is asking for expensive) but if you want things done, you don't have to wait for someone to volunteer. This is sort of what core were doing with rehrar before. It can't work now because:

1. Going through the CCS changes the relationship to more of a contractor

2. Rehrar only committing to part time while having other employment and even his own business means it's not possible to get the employee effect with him

3. He has already demonstrated that he will just leave when it suits him (very bad employee) and even took one of Monero's prized contractors as his own employee in the process

 

I think the monerobull option is a good one to at least see how it goes. It's like volunteer plus. Probably will get the quality of a dedicated volunteer (better than most employees) with a bit more obligation due to the payment. If monerobull can't commit enough and it's found that core needs someone to act in a more indentured role then someone else other than rehrar should be found because of the above.

 

Rehrar is not even a good contractor. In 2021 rehrar was essentially subletting Sarang to the project in an arrangement where Sarang was to get the reliable salary he desired from rehrar, while rehrar's only real purpose was to deal with Monero's volatility during contract periods. The fact that rehrar then asked for more Monero because the price fell during the contract period is just ridiculous because dealing with that volatility was his only job and I can't imagine for a second he would have given any XMR back if the price had risen.",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNYXpNX1NQeEpmRk5GUV9DM0cyUWcyajhsV0hQbHk2Vnk4YWFjcHB6SnNJRUdhdWdXc3ozRzZhLXR1UDNwSDRGTWVraThrbkVJWXB2WUs0aFdyREJnSlE9PQ==

In terms of utility Monero still has an important and highly functional place in the ecosystem though- privacy really is its killer app (as opposed to being an SoV).

"of course, not everybody has a good intent, but it was already the case with physical cash or with silver / gold coins...

the idea of monero is to be an alternative to physical cash, in a digital peer to peer version (via the internet), if governments want to get rid of physical cash or want to push too much restrictions on the use of physical cash.

the problem with too much surveillance is that even 'good' people become suspicious because the rules of what is 'good' and 'bad' can change according to the whims of the politicians in power.

and then it becomes difficult to talk about some things or to support some alternatives / initiatives / people...

being able to hold a crypto currency privately, and to use this crypto currency as you want, to send funds, to pay for something, to donate to a person / initiative, peer to peer, without any surveillance or any restriction, is an attribute of a useful store of value imo.

Even the privacy space I also use Railgun, which allows transactional privacy within the Ethereum network. 

And likewise (to get back to the thread), Bitcoin remains the best SoV imo. The weakness of Monero in that regard isn’t that’s it’s less well known, it’s that it’s privacy focus brings certain market limitations and therefore also market participants- meaning that it will never have sufficient trading liquidity to justify a market cap as large as Bitcoin.

"I'm not sure if liquidity or ""ease of exchange"" really has any impact on how good of a store of value anything is?

historically, the main store of value has been gold, and hasn't the liquidity or ease of exchange of gold always been way worse than that of Monero is now? Trading actual gold is really hard because it's heavy and costly to securely store and move around. There aren't that many places in a city where you can actually buy or sell gold, and you even likely have to pay huge fees at any such place. At some point people started mainly doing the ""this paper proofs that I own a bunch of gold somewhere"", and trading that is easier, but I'm talking about before that existed and when trading gold always meant trading physical gold that's in your possession.",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOYWF5c3FhMTBlanQtN3cxZTBiV0lhRG9yXzBvQ3A5S3JTMldERWdWaUZaU01JZk4wTEFUZlFWS01teUdwLS1LYWJCOEFXbmU4djh5UUtkS0V2QjRjVFE9PQ==

Not for the reasons your stating necessarily, As everything is ""better"" then Bitcoin from a technical perspective. But Bitcoin will keep being the big dog because of narrative and just how big and secure it currently is. 

Monero will be worth an insane amount in the future assuming quantum computing dont fuck it up (same goes for all crypto basically), and the absence of some other privacy coin taking over.

Given Moneros current position as number one, there is a good chance it will stay that way.

bitcoin btc is not a store of value, this is all narrative and marketing.

they don't realize that they can end up with 'tainted' tokens, and then have problem because of that.

"Yes.

From a game theory perspective, hodlers in bitcoin are free riders. Their wealth is protected and it's value stored at no cost to them. But there's a cost to maintain the network, that is, the infrastructure that gives their holdings value. They bear none of it. The people that bear the cost are *users*, people that spend bitcoin.

This is why we see the trend being that bitcoin is a hodlers coin and is not used. Of course the ultimate outcome is that miners won't be profitable and so security will decrease, and with it, value. If people don't use bitcoin it cannot have value for anyone.

This is of course a consequence of a hard cap, and all hard cap coins have this problem. A tail emission accomplishes the predictability of supply that a hard cap does, while avoiding this free riding problem: holders pay the network to secure their wealth in the form of slight debasement of their wealth. And, they pay it in proportion to the amount of benefit they get from the network, because every coin is debased at the same rate every block.",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPdDk4UWdSWl81UlBNVkQtb0t1blhGZkstb2FfS29TSVhqbUZMSHY0UVliSnNDLU1QaThaS3VOUnc1bmZhOF9NZXVFZHc1cl91VVVVNDMzNFFMdTBGQl9qODU1d3hZcDJiSnJodmdFcnBQN289

"Well, it's certainly fun to make predictions 20 or 30 years ahead. But I think the hit rate will be abysmal, especially in a fast-moving field like cryptocurrencies.

I suspect nobody saw Bitcoin coming in 2007. A stroke of genius, and where there was nothing, suddenly there was something, and it became successful, even dominant for a while.

Think it can't happen again? Especially with a time horizon of 20 or 30 years out? Think again.

Who knows whether just tomorrow somebody invents a new consensus algorithm that is better than both ""proof of work"" and ""proof of stake"", and each and every coin that uses one of those immediately becomes a dinosaur. Bitcoin and Monero *both* flipped out of the way.

Maybe that's impossible, maybe such a third, brand new class of consensus algorithms does not exist, but hey, do you think that people in 2007 would have deemed ""proof of work"" distributed consensus to be possible until it more or less fell from the sky?

Monero has very good privacy, but most people have no idea how complex the implementation of that privacy is. Spoiler: The mind almost boggles. For that, Monero works considerably slower than Bitcoin, and transactions are considerably larger in bytes. You can't really ""forget"" any transactions on the Monero blockchain and prune it either because you don't know what is spent or not.

How about somebody coming up, just tomorrow, with a radically different privacy coin technology that is, in comparison with Monero at least, dead-simple. With tiny yet still fully private transactions? With a small blockchain *somehow*?

Again, maybe such a thing may not exist, but can we be sure? Before the arrival of CryptoNote people also may have laughed you out of the room if you suggested an ""opaque blockchain"".

And I could go on. Maybe in 20 years people may simply mostly have lost interest in cryptocurrencies.

"Maxis have a limited understanding of the future.

1. Diminishing returns (even if like Gold it stays a boring hedge against fiat inflation)
2. Capitalization finishes and Bitcoin loses its characteristic as investment and is now a boring store of value. Marketeers will have problems selling this when usability is low.
3. Monero is a private store of wealth similar to an offshore bank account. And when Bitcoin stops being an investment other properties to rich BItcoiners will suddenly become important.
4. At that stage any on-chain transaction will make Bitcoins more dirty and potentially worth less.

That is what will happen. The market will price this in long before it actually happens. The question is only when. Not if.

"It's been done on BCH, not sure if it's open source tho, its worth to check out.

The main issues with grass roots adoption:

1.) Normies see only risks to it and are vary of all crypto due to the propaganda and the vast amount of scams this industry produced (hell, all of the top 10 coins are scamcoins currently  and none of them should exist by now).

2.) There is no direct incentive to implement crypto

3.) After blockstream fucked up btc, cryptoadoption pretty much stalled outside of some small concentrated pockets in some countries, but it's very limited

4.) regulatory concerns, businesses are reluctant to accept it due to these concerns and they don't really know how to handle it/implement it properly at all.",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPT29peS0zRjVfaFNDdnNwalgwWmJEOEhhVVF3RjQzeHZRdktaV2NUTURiQXVld0NDcnRDV1VxOWFWNXVTQ0x5Ym16QUljazkzWGJHQ3ZtNEQxS0JXMnc9PQ==

"I will have to disagree with you unfortunately. As much as I wish this to be the case I can't see a world in which it does for a few reasons.

1. Regulatory issues. For mainstream use you require adoption by mainstream platforms and many of these guys especially in the US are too threatened to add support.


2. adding support is actually more resource intensive. After doing my own research recently for how I can add monero as one of many currencies to an all in one API solution it's actually a huge pain and very costly to manage a lot of monero wallets all at once. This is because you can't just query a node for information without having access to your keys.


3. Similar to 2 because of the extra work to support this cryptocurrency you have long wait times to sync wallets and use your coins. This is very unfriendly to normies which will quickly make them say ""fuck that"" and move on without a second thought.

"I think sending messages to companies to get them accept XMR is not really going to work, especially if they're from a template. Even if you can convince them to accept it, there needs to be enough people who actually want to buy their product using XMR. It would probably result in a negative result if people spammed a business to accept XMR and then nobody bought anything from them.

I think the real way that Monero becomes popular is if privacy gets popular. That means promoting privacy projects in general (i.e Tor) as a means to an end to people who don't know better.

- haveno reto up and working (providing links to download / guide)  
- last post being a shill for ASICs, could mention things like Antbleed in 2017 which could have been scary af for btc lol

on an unrelated sidenote offtopic  
yo that was fucked with what happened to your CCS, like literally the dude that couldnt even secure his own wallet, which fluffypony definitely had the proper right setup with iirc shits like qubesOS and whatnot, like proper actual setup but the clown that himself made a mockery of every cryptocoin users is the one to tell you that your CCS is making a mokery of the CCS? that's just straight up bullshit, like fuck that straight up  
  
i never ever had any beef with diego but the dude is also a fucking joke, like, no offense /u/rehrar but u kinda is...  
  
like, i literally never got paid for any of my very smol contributions to the monero ecosystem, neither when i was running the bridges from irc <-> keybase (which only core was using at the time) then <-> matrix <-> discord  
not even a single donation even tho my address was up there  
i did giveaway a bunch of moneros tho, even to rehrar himself through the xmr bot /u/hooftly had setup at the time  
which funny enough, at the time diego offered me a job as sysadmin that i just declined cause the fuck do i know about any of that, however hooftly mentioned to me that it was his dream job, like the dude knew his shits and speculated that the reason diego made that offer to me and not to him was cause of my tits or some shit  
  
but it wasnt just that but even diego's whole work ethic, for example made a ""github"" channel on discord so it could have been updated automatically every time there's a commit, the thing is that, to work, it needed something with webhooks or somethin somethin and only the repository owner could activate that feature  
so i posted a guide in the channel so that diego could just enable that  
but months passed and it never ever was enabled ever  
so that, added to some other reasons and personal reasons, had to ""clean house"" or whatever  
came back few months later, same shit, diego just taking a step back, not doing shit and getting paid while others were doing the work for him basically  
so ended up making a new server and btw, that was 20 hours a day (not the 20 hours a week he's asking), all of that for free, filling up 10s of captchas per hours every day for weeks to boost that SEO bullshit  
  
and not a single donation my way, ever  
  
but u know what? even tho it irk me the wrong way, it never actually bothered me cause from my perspective, being an early adopter is definitely enough and can give back to the community without asking anything in return, and i wasnt even an early adopter, i became one only after RandomX was being scheduled, i was mining other CPU coins at the time and that was one of the most important aspect to me so when XMR was planning that then just went full XMR  
  
but seeing diego that, on top of being a very early adopter, already having been on the payroll for years, having questionable work ethics and been involved into some drama that tbh, i dont even give a fuck about any of the drama but all of that, still coming in asking for yet again more $$$ while others literally could do it for wayyyy less like you offered...  
and honestly, at this point i dont even know why rehrar not just working for free, like literally, are those people just that bad at managing their own money that they still need to make CCS despite being very early adopters?  
and that fuking luigi dude..  
  
bunch of clowns  
we already have clown world, dont let monero ecosystem follow up....

"It's a misconception that tor behind VPN is bad that gets repeated again and again. I once saw a very good video of an it security guy that explained why tor and VPN is actually a good idea in some cases.

A vpn provider is basically an intermediate in front of your ISP. 

You, vpn, isp

If you use tor also then all the data to your VPN goes through the tor network and the Vpn provider also can not see what you do.

honestly, this topic is such a headache i dont think the voices in my head will ever reach consensus on what to even do with those informations lol  
  
like,  to some extent would definitely consider myself more as a normie  
but also... if its a single purpose rig with single purpose VM to only run haveno and no other services, like, it's not like it would be accessing websites but literally just the haveno network with very strict firewall rules denying both incoming and outgoing and only manually allowing the IPs / port / protocol required for haveno's functionalities...  
  
like, it's just tough figuring out what could potentially be the attack vectors with those different setups u know :/  
  
so i guess it's more the type of question to be like ""what are yall personally using as a setup?""  
if the voices in my head cant reach consensus by themselves, it could be helpful to have some ideas on the majority rule of how people are actually using haveno  
  
but i assuming not many would be willing to in some way doxx how their own network be setup or whatever which could then lead to targetted attack if an attacker be like ""oh, that one be using unsecure this or that so lets pwn that network o.o""",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQdTFmMGo1WFVLTlNKX1dLa2JSb3ZTaWRUemxEVzZOQnhMRnZEZFJlcWNPZUl1SnQzMS15WERBU1BOV0RVTXE3dXN4VG1aU3EwOXMzQ0pLSDlrSUV4Qnc9PQ==

from my perspective the ""fat redditor moment"" comment was in fact the more mature of the both of u  
  
like, empathy is something that we grow to learn and feel over the years, if you're in a place in your life that u just wanna murder people you dont even know nor has even met, just cause the people on the tv been telling you that is what you should think

">  Not so much for those living in most Democratic countries.

Are you talking about America?

Do you still think America - which is participating in and funding a conflict tentatively recocgnized by the International Court of Justice (as well as at least one US court!) as being a likely case of genocide, against the will of a majority of Americans from every party, in order to appease the whims of oligarch-funded AIPAC and the imperialist goals of the illegitimate Zionist entity in occupied Palestine - is a democracy?

The country where:

* one party is running a Diet Dictator for president (who has expressed support for the ongoing, previously-mentioned genocide) and
* the other party said ""no primary debates allowed, this is our candidate, deal with it"" and had a court rule that they were allowed to rig their own primaries without facing any consequences (and is currently funding and participating in the previously mentioned genocide), and
* there are no third parties because of legalized bribery (Citizens United + the recent Supreme Court decision) and an archaic system designed to keep marginalized urban populations from having a person-by-person voting power equivalent to mostly-white rural states (Electoral College),
* the military and CIA have destabilized multiple democratically-elected, left-leaning governments in South America and elsewhere,
* domestic police are using lawfare against peaceful Stop Cop City Protestors, charging them with domestic terrorism for being at a concert near where a police car was burned,
* the sitting president *and* his rival candidate have both expressed support for violent assaults on student protestors peacefully exercising a supposedly-inalienable right enshrined in the country's constitution,
* federal laws designed to prevent human rights violations, such as the Leahy Laws, are ignored freely and without apparent repercussion,

Is that the democracy you're referencing? Really? *Really?*

"Absolutely. Bi-directional swaps are an important feature and not being able to swap Monero for Bitcoin (from the user's perspective) is limiting.

That being said, we don't know of any implementations of XMR<>BTC bi-directional swaps that don't require another blockchain. Since these chains are small and add complexity we don't think this a good approach. 
Using a new, very small Blockchain (like Thorchain or Serai) is also a security risk, especially when it has only a few dozen nodes and is therefore much less decentralized than the Monero blockchain. See: https://slowmist.medium.com/slowmist-analysis-of-three-consecutive-attacks-on-thorchain-6223f1c691be. Atomic swaps are the only technology that allow cross blockchain swaps while maintaining the security guarantees of the underlying Blockchain.

Luckily, swapping Monero for Bitcoin will be possible to implement using only those chains when pre-signing transactions becomes available in the next Monero hard-fork. Until then, any implementation we could think of would be vulnerable to DoS attacks.

"> What would the world be like if Americans didn't fight for their independence from Britain? 

meh.

A better example of a just war in America would be the indigenous people resisting ethnic cleansing. Unfortunately they were outgunned (plus very significant, usually-unintentional biowarfare), but it was still an actual example of a just and righteous reason to fight.

>Or the allies resisting Hitler? 

The allies are currently conducting a genocide of their own, so, stopping Hitler was good, but not so good if we just make another one. ""Eretz Israel"" is the new ""Lebensraum"".

>Even more recent, Ukrainians defending themselves from Russia?

Complex. Russia shouldn't be expanding, but neither should NATO be expanding up to Russia's borders, that's the exact same thing (with the roles reversed) which almost caused nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis. And although the US didn't invade Cuba with its own soldiers in response, it did launch the failed Bay of Pigs invasion.

As is standard US foreign policy, we do something, then declare war (proxy or otherwise) on another nation when they do the same thing. We posture ourselves as the moral authority in the room. We aren't, never were, and at least so long as we operate under capitalism, never will be. 

Most importantly I'm sure neither side gives a shit about actual Ukranian people. ""We'll fight to the last Ukranian"" and all that. So no, I'm not going to deem that a ""just war"" either.

"Its the most common questions and I think to say yes it is possible but not without tax implications.  Your coins could get locked on an exchange converting back to cash if there is too suspicious of activity.  This is why P2P is just better.

Here is what I recommend though if you must absolutely and want to raise less red flags.

*  Buy any major crypto from said exchange first
* Don't withdraw much more than you are buying in legitimate crypto
* Wait at least 1 year to start cylcing out of crypto back to fiat to avoid 1 year gains tax
* If you cannot wait one year be prepared to pay 30% capital gains when cashing out

Alternatively you can sign up for an exchange like [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) which allows a visa card that can run off of tether.  There are limits to this as well if you're withdrawing cash directly from an ATM and it requires some KYC to get ""bonus"" levels you have to stake their CRO token.

">Is there any other way than sending cash by mail or meeting in person? I mean : something safe.

Cash by mail via USPS is one of the safest and most anon payment methods. There are also other options like bank transfer, paypal, cashapp, and many more but those aren't nearly as safe. You can't get charged back on cash that came in the mail. I'm not sure what more you expect, the only other method that is more safe is buying with other cryptos.

The arbitrator has no real incentives to collude with anyone since it would majorly harm the reputation of haveno (and thus volume and thus arbitration fees) and non-corrupt arbitrators would kick them out. You don't burn a constant stream of XMR and your reputation for small one-time fraud (small because the average haveno trade is below $500).",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXM3hJNTdBcTlqbGhDWEd2eTBBbXFtNFd2NjUzQzF5eURBYVIwaUtfaWdxS1dHZWw3aHUwcDEzNGpXdko2NUtPLTFGRXEtRENPUWRXeWdacnBvQVJoNXc9PQ==

">would you think you can get jailed by somehow being associated with a drug dealer for example just because you did P2P with him without knowing?

Not sure how UK law deals with it, but in US you would be charged with being part of a ""conspiracy"" and/or money laundering if they have even a hint that you might have been aware it wasnt being used legally. You'd also (again this is US so YMMV) have to keep records if you are in the ""business"" of buying and selling crypto on a regular basis.

If you keep your transaction amounts small enough, and avoid people who explicitly tell you its for drugs or other crimes, you should be relatively safe, but if you intend to make a business out of it and actually profit, you will likely eventually get attention unless you're registered and doing all you proper taxes and such.",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYcG5kdEhoNHEyeHRnODRfakdNWVB5RFJaZGlUR2dESjVDZ2JOaXQ5d0FnN0d6MlVpdWp5U3BiZDBGVTl0R1dFZDBuYTNjd0dVMVh5QlVCZ1Jvdm0tOXc9PQ==

"Monero is/the #1 (by a massive margin) only crypto used actively and solely as a form of CURRENCY. BTC is propped up/just part of the US stock market now and fooling the masses who have no clue otherwise thinking they're hedging their bets or investing into some new or valuable 'anonymous' tech.

Think about your parents, then think about the top 2 people they talk to the most/know the best (aside from yourself) then do that for those 2 and do it 50 times. The chances of 5% of those people having detailed knowledge of blockchains or BTC is very slim. 

8 billion human monkeys....75% of whom are all trying to use some form of currency or value or 'worth'....It's quite baffling the more you ponder it.

"Monero supply can be audited but indirectly. Here's how:

* The block reward is publicly available. Add all of them and you get the total amount of XMR ever produced.
* Each tx in the blockchain must prove that they're spending a valid input. It's a mathematical proof that's been thoroughly reviewed. All you have to do now is check if every tx in the blockchain is providing a valid proof or not.

If there's any invalid tx found anywhere in the blockchian, then you've successfully proven that Monero is broken. If no invalid tx found, then you can be certain that there's been no hidden amount of XMR floating around.

As for tail emissions, it may be flawed but the alternative is worse. For example, BTC (no tail emission)  vs DOGE (10k per block).

* The block reward of BTC is getting lower and lower. More home/individual miners are shutting down their rigs. Only big mining farms are profitable.
   * DOGE is still profitable to mine at an individual level = more decentralized hash power.
* Older BTC ASICs are now nothing more than a expensive brick.
   * Many older DOGE ASICs are still competitive in terms of profitability.
* The on-chain tx fee on BTC is extremely high. In a survey, it was found that a huge number of on-chain wallets can't even move their funds because of it.
   * DOGE on-chain tx fee is way lower.

With a fixed rate of 0.6 XMR per 2 min, at any given point in time, you can know exactly how many XMR will be in supply. The market will decide on its price based on that. For example, DOGE supply is infinitely more than XMR and thus, the market decided its value to be around 10 cents.",r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaN0Z0QWYyak1KNUdnSUtYNEFFd1hkTzc5VGZZQnN3ajlTRUdyNHoydWpoaGx2Y1JUeTI0Rkl6V1lnRGFiaHIzYm9qZk5yRWp5OHI0R0lxNmgxeGY0a3c9PQ==
