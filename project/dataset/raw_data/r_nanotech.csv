Please read this!!! It explains it very well!!! I’ve spent the last 4 months researching this as I’ve fallen victim. Thank goodness I am a scientist! 

Traditional smart dust is copper based. I sent some samples to a testing centre and they found no indication of metal, and was all carbon based. Initially, I was shut down. But I have been documenting my experiences and collecting evidence that I continued my research and found newer and more efficient graphene based nano material. Graphene is 100% carbon. 

I started doing research to see if an MRI could detect smart dust. The link I’ve provided explains how smart dust is way too small to be detected that way. And because of the nature of its backscatter communication, impossible to detect with regular RF detector (note, smart dust uses RF (EMF) for communication). It has to be detected using harmonic or ultra wide radar aka kHz.

I’ve been victim of sexual harassment with this stuff. It’s real, and those that do not agree, just don’t know how to research. Or have not experienced it and wouldn’t even know where to begin. I am a research scientist and have read hundreds of papers and it’s taken me months to narrow down my searches to find answers. 

If you want to know more about graphene based nanotechnology :

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Potential_applications_of_graphene

It’s a great summary , just available on Wikipedia. As soon as I knew to search graphene based smart dust, the research was readily available. It speaks to sensors, smart dust, etc. anything you’re experiencing there’s an explanation for it here. Use this as a precursor to doing your own peer reviewed research.

HPLC, DLS, plate reader assays, tangential flow filtration. By virtue of what cells we were delivering to, I also did a lot of flow cytometry.

"Is Graphene durable enough to survive prolonged intense contact with a material? I would've thought it would simply break down quite quickly? Suffering tears?

How do you intend to utilise the Graphene? Are you planning to use the edge of a sheet as your cutting blade? To utilise the monolayer thickness? Or are you planning to utilise multiple sheets layered on top of each other?

The edge of your Graphene will not be completely smooth either, you'll have loose strands of bonded carbon here and there, This might affect your cutting quality at the nano scale at least for the first few uses I would guess.

Graphene would bring benefits in heat resistance and if I am wrong about the wear and tear factor could be a valid method of cutting at the nano scale, I think using multiple layers stacked would be the best way to start possibly removing one layer after each successful test until you find the sweet spot?

"My initial idea was to use the edge of a single graphene sheet due to its atomic thickness, which would theoretically allow for extremely precise cuts. I believe that for certain methods, a sheet made up of multiple layers of graphene could be ideal for increased durability. However, a single layer allows for more precise cuts, especially in applications such as graphene production, where the goal is to cut individual layers of atoms.



For precision cutting at the nanoscale, such as the production of monolayer graphene, I believe a single layer sheet would be more suitable. This is because a single layer can minimize interference and provide cleaner, more defined cuts.



My idea is based on the fact that a single layer of graphene only has covalent bonds, which allows for cutting weaker bonds with precision. To solve the problem of loose carbon strands, a good approach would be to apply tension, which would theoretically act as a very tight line, keeping the graphene edge smoother and more efficient.",r/nanotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYWUZXSFdLYjVSOG9rcDZ0eGw0Xy00TTU1d0xqbG9mR2JhcElCNkRtYXhBakVFT3Z6Z0ZOa3RIZjlFb29qRFpJYzM4OFgtUlJTbVpNa0ZaSTJFUXdQQWc9PQ==

"I understand your concerns about graphene’s strength and rigidity. Here are a few points that may help explain how graphene could be a viable tool for nanoscale cutting:

1- Atomic Thickness: Graphene is composed of a single layer of carbon atoms, which gives it an extremely thin thickness, on the order of one atom thick. This allows for precise cutting at nanoscales, where other tools may be limited by the thickness of their materials.

2- High Tensile Strength: Despite its fragile appearance, graphene is incredibly strong. It has a tensile strength much higher than that of steel, for example, which makes it capable of withstanding considerable forces during cutting without significantly deforming.

3- Heat Conduction: Graphene has excellent thermal conductivity, which means it can dissipate the heat generated during cutting efficiently. This is crucial in nanoscale cutting operations, where precise temperature control is essential to avoid damage to samples or materials.

4- Structural Flexibility: Graphene’s hexagonal structure gives it a unique flexibility, easily adapting to irregular shapes and surfaces during cutting. This is advantageous in applications where conformity to complex geometries is required.

5- Potential for Atomic Manipulation: Due to its precise atomic structure and ability to precisely cut covalent bonds, graphene can be used for atomic manipulation at the nanoscale, enabling extremely precise and controlled cuts.

These points highlight how graphene not only addresses the challenges of perceived brittleness, but also offers unique characteristics that make it a promising tool for nanoscale cutting operations. I would like to hear more about your experience and your perspectives on the potential of graphene in this context.",r/nanotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYWHROVEZwOV9WWlN0bXRyRi12em5wdF9maHZFcVVuUHVEYTBfVndjaEYzeGltTUZjeko4a2J2cmlkdGtGVnlKeERiNVBQU094d3VNSHlWVXk0SkNrZ0E9PQ==

"It's possible you could reinforce the center with a different material that's thicker and more durable perhaps? That's what I had in mind with the 2 plates surrounding the Graphene.

You most likely are going to need multiple layers to increase its durability regardless but you aren't really sacrificing much in the way of precision given each layer is only an atom thick.

Your serration idea could work here if you separate the graphene into smaller increments around the edge of a premade saw blade with a dulled edge, smaller areas of Graphene are less prone to wear and tear I would assume anyways. 

Ultimately I think multiple layers of Graphene sandwiched between two reinforcing plates might be your best bet initially at least in my opinion but I wouldn't be surprised if there is a better method you come up with!

electromagnetism, the rudiments of solid-state quantum mechanics. And most importantly, chemistry (Structural DNA, synthetic organic chem, kinetics and reaction transition-state theory, molecular mechanics, etc). 

Problem is, nanotechnology will vary widely in required knowledge.

"Ha, I just had to ask ;) I'm a nanotechnologist and my PhD was very graphene heavy - a few thousand hours in fabricating, manipulating, and analyzing graphene and other 2D materials. The flexibility and thermal properties are the only advantages I can endorse from this list... not familiar with work on using graphene to ""cut covalent bonds"" in a mechanical sense - perhaps you can link some papers you've found on the topic?

It's possible, I suppose, that graphene could be used to cut something - like how you could use a sheet of paper to cut a watermelon if only you held it very firmly close to the cutting edge to prevent it from bending... but the advantage of doing so as opposed to another material isn't obvious to me. Yes, it's atomically thin, but we can also make ""atomically sharp"" cutting edges as well, or use other cutting methods (FIB or something).",r/nanotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYUwzQUN5SmFRY2Exblc0LXlLbEh5S2FJdWphQUtVbVd2eC16YUo5T0dUNWNKakZtTkROWGo1RG96RE5MSGJqU29WWU1TaTlRMFNBV2FkVjBvZTdlZTRwekNrVDJJaWFmQi1iMENkbUF2RVk9
"I don't think that your questions are relevant to the subject of my post. But I will answer them.


""What university has classes where the professor do not attend?"" - My university is in Russia. I won't say the name. For that, you can contact me.



""If you know nothing about your specialization, can you even say are specialized?"" - I just couldn't choose correct word for what I wanted to say. My English isn't very good, that's why I apologized for my English in the post.


""Why have you not been provided with at least a list literature to follow?"" - I don't know. Probably because the proffers (teachers) never attended the classes and nobody cared (I, too, didn't care at the moment. I had other subjects needed to be done)



""Are you sure your not attending something pretending to be what it is not?"" - The University is known, but whether Nanotech is ok in this university or not - I don't know. I had my own reasons why I started studying in this university and in this faculty.



We do study math, physics etc. I understand that there subjects are important and I am trying my best to learn them but I want to learn about nanotech too.


My post is about *nanotechnology* itself.
Yes, Nano is very wide, but it doesn't mean that there are no books/materials about nano that would help me to know more about nanotechnology. 


Thanks for your suggestions!",r/nanotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRkhvY3MwSFRpYzNOZXJiTllPNF9oczlIempsbkNMR0JRSTFqRFhBN2JUSU85Mm9leDhhRWNTaXlpZFozS1BRNzNjLWFZajlCbUdFNGhpVm85RnFhWWc9PQ==
