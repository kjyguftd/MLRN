"What? Do we forget how slow put Boeing Starliner together? Yes, eventually they managed to do it, and above that minor helium leak (which is massively overblown by media) it works perfectly now, but it supposed to be operational years ago. Crew Dragon also have a ton of issues, some are quite significant (yet, nobody talks about). You can find a quite good list by Jum May on Twitter\\*1. Not to mention that it also had 4 years of delay.

And if you look back one step about commercialization: commercial cargo also had years of delays, Cygnus is also a ""replacement"" because Kistler cannot manage financial milestones. Also both launch vehicles (developed trough CRS contracts) had issues which leaded to loss-of-mission.

About Artemis and commercialization: we had two lander so far, Peregrine didn't even reach the Moon, IM-1 flipped, Masten got bankrupted. And now one of the space suit supplier decided to cancel their contract. Aaaaand HLS? Bruh, I don't even want to start it.

Commercialization doesn't look good if you look the big picture. CRS went relatively well, the rest of... kinda meh.

"> which made it much more expensive.

Most of the SLS' costs are fixed costs: factory and launch infrastructure. With a higher launch rate the per mission cost would be significantly lower. In theory 3-4 SLS would be possible to produce per year. 

> Orion can be launched into LEO

I think you don't look Artemis as the whole, you just picked SLS and try to rid out at any cost ignoring how many other component you affects. There are a bunch of co-manifested payloads launched to Gateway which require Orion (and Block 1B/2) too. Also Orion is heavy, (26t) way over F9's LEO and FH's structural capability. The next best option would be Vulcan-Centaur or New Glenn, but then you yet again have to launch components in a small chunks which make the whole architecture much more complex, more expensive (somebody have to develop the tug and it will be probably billions to develop, and hundred millions to manufacture \\_each\\_. Eventually not sure that it will be cheaper than just use the SLS.  
  
Also after the cancellation of Constellation NASA dropped the LEO mission support, which could cause thermal problems around LEO. Etc.

No one even in their sweetest dreams sees SLS flying 3-4 times a year. The limit of dreams is 2. And it will still be more expensive for most missions than Falcon Heavy.



>I think you don't look Artemis as the whole, you just picked SLS and try to rid out at any cost ignoring how many other component you affects


You're right, I'm in favor of rejecting SLS



>ignoring how many other component you affects. There are a bunch of co-manifested payloads launched to Gateway which require Orion (and Block 1B/2) too


I didn't understand. Is Artemis about lunar exploration or building the Gateway (and why is Gateway needed at all, from the same play)? 


By the way, for building Gateway, SLS isn't necessary either. According to the wiki, I-HAB weighs 10 tons, the refueling module is about the same, and I couldn't find the weight of the Crew and Science Airlock Module, but it's unlikely to be much more. Everything is within the capabilities of Falcon Heavy. The only difference is that SLS sends them together with Orion.


>Also Orion is heavy, (26t) way over F9's LEO and FH's structural capability


Naturally FH will have to modify and add structural strength to the second stage and add a third hydrogen stage (less likely) or develop a tug (more likely) to deliver Orion to the Moon. Still cheaper than SLS.


>The next best option would be Vulcan-Centaur or New Glenn, but then you yet again have to launch components in a small chunks which make the whole architecture much more complex, more expensive (somebody have to develop the tug and it will be probably billions to develop, and hundred millions to manufacture _each_.

It’s more complicated, yes, it’s unlikely to be more expensive, since for this it would be possible to modify the Centaur, which, by the way, was proposed by ULA for its lunar program. Plus, as part of its construction of HLS, BO is developing a CIS Lunar Transporter, which in theory will also be able to do this.


>Also after the cancellation of Constellation NASA dropped the LEO mission support, which could cause thermal problems around LEO


Thermal problems?..


>Yes, eventually you can overcome of those, but you also lost an SHLV capability


Falcon Heavy, NewGlenn, and Starship are SHLVs. 


In hindsight, even in 2011, it didn't make sense as it was considering three designs, and the current SLS design scored fewer points than than even the Lego set of ULA rockets.

>SLS is here, it's ready, it's operational, it have a perfect fit in the architecture and also allows missions which wouldn't be possible without that


Of course, it will fit into the architecture because the architecture was originally built around SLS. For example, the Gateway is a crutch to compensate for the fact that the SLS cannot deliver Orion to LLO. After spending 50 billion on this, it is not impressive. 


There have been many different ways discussed for lunar architecture, but the worst option of all was chosen. However, it has now reached flight readiness, and it will complete a couple of missions, but it is impossible to build a sustainable lunar architecture with it due to its cost and flight frequency.

"> What would be the correct reference frame exactly?

I'm wondering too and would like to be enlightened. 

Just making my own attempt here:  some sites suggest that the galactic North is toward the top of the image. Galactic North seems to be perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy that we are looking across when we look into the milky way. 

Along this perpendicular, galactic North seems to be arbitrarily the direction that is closest to our own North as determined by the ecliptic, itself approximating to Earth's North along its axis of rotation.

"Hi! 
This is Karen, Hal Loden’s daughter and javenbonz’s aunt. 

First of all, I have to say I am blown away by the kind words said for the man I simply know as “Dad.” He is everything that you have described and so much more. Kind, loving, giving, not presumptuous, and most of all, humble. 

I grew up thinking that my Dad had a job just like all of my friends’ dads (which is partially true since I grew up in the NASA community). He went to work in the morning and was home by dinner time. Every now and then, he came home for lunch, which was an extra treat. I have memories of my Mom packing my brothers and me up in the family station wagon…in our pajamas…to go watch Dad at “work.” I remember sitting in a dark room with stadium like seating, peering through a window, and having to be extra “quiet” because Dad was working. Looking back on those times, I now know that we were in the viewing room, during a mission, of Mission Control. Wow. 

At the time of Apollo 11, I was only 3 1/2 years old. I, of course, didn’t realize then the impact my Dad had on the history made that July of 1969. As I grew older, I knew that my Dad played a significant part in his job at NASA, but I actually didn’t fully realize how much until July of 2019. 

In July of 2019, the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 lunar landing was celebrated. My Dad was an honored guest of this celebration because of his role in Mission Control. My brothers and I, along with our spouses and children, were there for the weekend long celebration. At our childhood home, Mom and Dad pulled out all of the memorabilia Dad had accumulated during his service at NASA for us to look at. I was blown away by the things my Dad had from his NASA days. It was only then, that I truly realized the impact my Dad, and many others like him, had made in the advance of space exploration. 

Today, my parents are living their dream retirement life. Dad is still very humble and will tell you he was just “doing his job” back in the late 1960’s. As his daughter, I couldn’t be more proud of the man he is. Not just because of his contributions he made to space exploration, but because of the man of integrity that he was and still is to this very day. He is, and will always be, my hero!",r/nasa,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNabUo0LXNTQWk2cVVlaTRGZklOb3lxYl9xYVVJdXc5eUtWSGQ5WGxvWVN4NDNJTTA3SnFfVEdfb2RVN2VoSjdhNmV3VGx6WV9NNWk0Z2VvZjA5ZEVzS0E9PQ==

"Alright, been thinking for a couple days. Give me 2 more minutes of your time...

Let's say I boot up a bunch of computers that simply multiply the order in which I booted them by 1000 and they say ""There is a 99.9% chance that there will be no more than \\[1000 x boot order\\] computers to ever be booted."" Every single one of them would actually be correct! No matter when I stopped booting computers, if I look back and see what percentage of them were correct, 99.9% will have provided the correct answer, which is exactly what they all said. If a weather man predicts rain correctly 90% of the time that he says there's a 90% chance of rain, that's a very good weather man!

It doesn't matter if you think the order in which I booted those computers was random or not, and it makes no difference how much time elapses from the time I boot the computers to when they provide their answer. Each of those computers was correct that there was a 99.9% chance it was providing an upper limit that would never be exceeded.

"Spinning at a rate synchronous with the orbital period around its star is exactly right, but it actually isn't as rare as it might seem because it isn't a random occurrence. Orbiting bodies are tidally compressed and deformed by their orbital partners, and when the rotation of the body does not match the orbital period this causes the deformations to process around the body. The heat generated from this deformation comes from the rotational energy of the body and slows its rotation until they are locked. In the case of a body that is rotating more slowly than its orbital period, the mismatch will drag it up to speed until they are locked, this time taking energy from the orbital system, slightly lowering the orbit's distance to loan the rotational energy.

It takes a long time for these changes to occur. The Earth is very slowly slowing its rotation for this reason, and you are likely familiar with our own tidally locked partner, Luna.",r/nasa,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnQWNXeHRLNC1fVHhCaHVqZjAxanc5VzdtVEdCZlZEQkhrVjBpa0J3STktLWFwUjZvdzRYd2hKX21acTdzeWhLQUNtemNRLWRtUG5OWlBwbUhLaVRnRXc9PQ==

"> and why is Gateway needed at all

""The Gateway is intended **to serve as a communication hub, science laboratory, and habitation module for astronauts**."" You just have to use the Google. And there are a plenty of article out there why NRHO is a good orbit for that what are the pros (and cons) over other orbits. 

> According to the wiki, I-HAB weighs 10 tons

The problem isn't the weight but the lack of everything else what it require to move that stuff to NRHO, then dock with the rest of the station. Like propulsion, navigation, etc. Everything what Orion can do. Same applies all other modules. Yes, you can develop a space tug but why if you have to do a spacecraft for the crew anyway? It was possible to do with HALO because it is bolted to PPE which provide all the propulsion, navigation, etc. services for that, but the rest of the modules won't. 

> Still cheaper than SLS.

So you have to develop a tug (billions), build it, launch it (probably 500M) and then you have to launch Orion anyway (so you need an SLS) and you think it is cheaper than just launch it with Orion. Okay.

> Thermal problems?..

You know, Earth is reflecting back a lot of sunshine which heaths up things on LEO. Orion is not designed to go trough that thermal cycle for extended period. Same problem exists with LLO. I think you seriously have no clue about spacecrafts and your knowledge stops at ""rocket sends some stuffs"".

> Naturally FH will have to modify and add structural strength to the second stage

Plus the first one, then make the whole human rated, support all abort mode, etc. etc. etc. IN theory ICPS is just a cheap, off the shelf interim solution for SLS until EUS will be ready. Just lengthen by a bit. And in fact, manufacturing that 3 stage wasn't particularly expensive comparing to the standard DCSS. The expensive part was that they had to go through all the calculations, had to prepare and modify the stage for the extended mission time, and had to human rate everything which required a lot of work. And that was expensive. This is not Kerbal Space Program where you just throw an another component into the mix and suddenly works. If you have to pay 100 engineers for 2 years to go trough those things thats already $250-$400M USD just in salaries and they didn't even had an office...
