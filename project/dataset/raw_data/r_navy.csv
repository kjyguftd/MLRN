"Goodfellow for C school. They make you stay at the Angelo inn on base when you first get there until you request to move off.

Apparently the rate changed by $1 between when I left the ship and when I got to TX, an at the time fellow first made me check in to the Inn anyway, despite already have a room off base. Got pulled into a room with a 2nd class who had done the same thing, except she’d been ignored the entire time leading up to checking in. The senior chief was actually reasonable, I had my emails from the chief who said I could take care of the process before I got there, and we didn’t get in trouble. But it’s the only C school I’ve been to where they offer the option to stay off base but only after you’ve started class. The daily rate for this barracks room with a shared bathroom and only a microwave was the full amount ($70), I found an extended stay hotel for $41. Talk about FWA, I’m not paying to stay in a barracks room.

on a serious note, if this is something people really want to pursue, this has to be addressed from a public health standpoint, to put in simply if substantial evidence can be found that students are contracting sickness from being in these closed spaces, then medical will be involved.

"You might be working on a Navy base, but almost no one here is qualified to help you out.

You can either turn down the job and try to find a new job somewhere else, or continue with the job which you already accepted and see if you can get into the GS pay system and climb the career ladder there.

"It’s funny you say this. 

Society is broken down into 3 categories:
 - 40% of the country hates Biden, his policies, thinks he’s a danger to society

- 40% of the country hates Trump, his policies, and thinks he’s a danger to society

- 20% really don’t care about politics. They keep a level head and move on with their life.

I think as a military member you need to move yourself into the 20% category, and if you are so easily dissuaded from continuing to serve because someone who has opposite views of you is elected to a THIRD of the government… it might be time for you to transition out.

"When I was on duty in Bahrain a few years ago we got this random call from the storage warehouse on base. Not quite sure what it was or who ran it, I just knew it had a bunch of various ship parts/supplies stored there. 

Apparently they had a bunch of girl scout cookies that were set to expire and were desperately trying to get them out to the various commands. So me and another sailor hopped in our duty golf cart and drove over there, and I was blown away to see a mountain of girl scout cookies in this place. It was literally up to the ceiling, thousands of boxes easily.

"Oh boy a hot one.

So first of all, Qual Tour - it's not as bad as tour dolphins were. Now if you were medically DQd before getting your dolphins and have to do ED dolphins THATS HARD. But fortunately you are likely already most the way there.

But it's mostly learning things about contracting, PPBE (planning, programming, budgeting, execution), QA and CIVPERS. Plus a technical or process improvement paper.

Then you have a few other quals to do depending on where you do a Qual tour. Since you are a sub guy, it's going to be at an industrial site, so thr real.difference will be a supship (oversight at a private construction yard) or public yards. Public yard you'll have to get a Qual as a zone manager and you wouldn't at a supship. Biggest difference in terms of the Qual I know between the two. Otherwise you'll be getting CDO at both, a form of a docking Qual, etc. Not a ton and all of them (other than CDO) build up your ED knowledge 

If you've done a Qual before it's more memorization than tactical applications. The ""scenarios"" on a board by their nature aren't as complicated as a tactical scenario. You are older, more.competent, and understand how the game is played at this point. It's not rough. It's still work and you still earn it, but it's not as bad.

Now for the second part. Not going to fully touch it but I'll say this. All but 1 sub guy in the EDO community I've known was in maintenance or construction. And those plans and how long it takes are all pretty well written in stone. No matter who is in the oval office, the work maintaining and procuring warfighting equipment for our warfighters remains largely the same. 

So a bigger question- with either candidate in the office, what concerns do you have about potential adversaries and future conflict. And do you want to stay in to make sure your Navy's sailors have the best chance to fight and win. That's who I like to think I'm doing the job for. Not senators, congressman, presidents. Not even the public so much, but yes them to a degree. But really I want to make sure when missiles start getting exchanged in the South China Sea, more american sailors are alive at the end of the exchange than the other side. That means delivering capability and platforms in the best condition possible and on time. And that's hard work, and noble work IMO.

Feel free to DM me. About EDO.",r/navy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZblhsQUdWRXhiYWtCUFl0czE1NUpXRkkzOW1jT1NGT2ZsNEIyTjZQRUNMMURWeGxBbjFMeEI3RkhFWnVZNE9xXzZkemtGM3Fmc1dleDVHMkdJVFpSa0E9PQ==

"My sponsor deserved a quick kick in the dick for sure. When I made 2nd, I took over the berthing and I made damn sure every new guy had a clean, fully outfitted rack and locker,  even had spare padlocks they could borrow until they could get their own. I also had about 4 lockers worth of toilet paper and hand soap because my predecessors let us go without either for months at a time on a couple of occasions. 

I also got to passive-aggressively disobey an order from our divo while I was in charge of the berthing.  The A-div side was getting collectively punished for something stupid, and weren't allowed to hang anything outside of their rack. So no towels on towel racks, no uniforms on locker hooks, nothing.  Our divo thought the ""nobody lives here"" look they were being punished with sure looked nifty, and it would be great if he could walk through our berthing without seeing all those towels and uniforms.  So he told me to move all the towel holders from the outside of the racks to the inside. Of course,  I says ""Aye aye sir I'll get right on it"" then spent a good bit of effort coming up with bs reasons for why I hadn't gotten it done yet. Supply issues, work order problems, emergent jobs that took precedence (you know that thing we had to do for the CO?), supply issues again (sorry sir, keep having issues getting the right part numbers), whatever.

Once upon a time (between 2006-2007) Andy Arnold (LCDR, and XO of USS Mustin, DDG-89) was VERY upset that there were no French fries onboard the ship because we couldn’t do a store on load while anchored out in South Korea. Also, none of the Officers wanted to go on liberty with Andy because he was an asshole (also, short, fat, and miserable).

He decided that the best course of action was to restrict the liberty of everyone in supply until he could get his French fries.

The SUPPO (name since forgotten) was an LDO and higher ranking than Andy, so he called the Captain, returned to the ship, and told Andy to go lick windows.

Afterwards, the brave heroes of Suppy had a bunch of white baseball hats done up in said South Korean port with an imagine of french fries in a-definitely-not-McDonald’s-fry-holder and also stitched MSTT (Morale Suppression Training Team) on the back.",r/navy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZT3ZWUGNWSVJhQ2VtRzF4S0x0Zk15cEQ5akc3UkFqY0t2Q214cDlmbTRsWVQ0cnROcUFmRm04Q25YY3Q4RE1hV3VNMjBCbUlGOEliWm5LY3djTklfbHc9PQ==

"OK, as someone who has coordinated the squadron move from NAS Whidbey to Norfolk to meet up with the carrier a whole bunch of times, and the move back after cruise, lemme explain:

Carriers coming home fly off all the jets the day before the ship pulls in. Every squadron gets a bunch of large 3 layered cardboard boxes (tri-walls) to pack their stuff into. Tools, computers, printers, test equipment, cruise boxes and knuckle busters (look them up) all of it gets packed up, stacked up, banded up, and organized for offload.

The squadron starts to pack out on the day fly offs happen. Some of the tri-walls are designated personal gear, i.e. sailors can put personal bags in them. Pilots can put bags in them too, and they do. Not all the aircrew get to fly home with the jets, some of them have to fly with the main body. These officers are nominally ""in charge"" of the main body movement.

All the packed gear gets banded up, and gets loaded onto tractor trailers, to be trucked back to the hanger at the squadron home station. In the case of the *Eisenhower,* the first squadron off the boat is usually the VAQ squadron, because they have to hustle over to the NAS Norfolk passenger terminal and get on a plane to fly back home to NAS Whidbey. The VAQ squadron typically gets off the ship right after the new fathers do.

Normally one of the squadrons at Oceana or NAS Whidbey will ""catch"" the jets when they get home, i.e. park them. The main body shows up the next day. Generally the squadron will have some people at home station, new people who checked in at the tail end of cruise, and were not sent off to meet up with the ship during cruise. Those people will stand watch while the main body is given an extended liberty, which is usually at least a 72 or a 96, then everyone comes back to work and waits for the trucks to come in. Norfolk to Whidbey is typically about a week transit time for the surface shipment to get there.

Once the trucks get there, they get unloaded, everyone unpacks, and everyone grabs their personal bag out of the personal gear tri-walls. They those tri-walls get stacked on a pallet and sent over to the supply warehouse for the next squadron to use them.

The CAG supply chief is the key person who organizes all this stuff, gets the trucks ordered, and loads the trucks with bodies from somewhere, I don't know where.",r/navy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZd2ExLVUwMUlqSEVKMGo4cGxiYVFxSXpDbFl3RDIxMGc4b3NzcVNPZGtYNWZ6T0Z2Nk1rSW96czhZbkl4Si1CQU9XaGxMUTEtb1o0Nkl1MDl3ejJNNEE9PQ==

There was a supply group on base that was testing the different uniform options, they had a grey shirt instead of khaki and it looked good and was light enough that summer heat would not have been an issue.  I was checking out of base to leave the Navy and talked with people there and everyone said they should just do the new NSU, Blueberries (everyone in the command loved them), and dress blues with a light material and make coveralls a shipboard assigned item.

"Assuming you will be starting college fall of 2025:

* Apply for federal student aid as soon as the web site allows, circa Feb 2025. Just because you are using post 9/11 doesn't mean you cannot get other grants, and you won't get any grants you don't apply for. Any grants awarded get refunded to you if post 9/11 fully covers all your tuition.

* Make sure you apply for fall semester/quarter admission as soon as you can. The earlier you start, the earlier you can get your planning underway

* Find out how your university handles certifying your class schedule for the VA. Each university has a Veteran Service Office of some kind, that is who you go through to get benefits.

* I suggest you start researching your degree program now. What are the mandatory classes, what are your electives, and prerequisites do they have. Then you plot out when, and in what order, you will take classes. Don't forget to figure out what else besides the degree credits you need; you will need General Education credits too. You might have some graduation requirements, too.

* Speaking as a CS grad, one thing you can try to find out now before you show up is what language and development environment the university uses, and get that set up so you can tinker with it before you show up.

"Well you are asking the right questions early. Like the others said, TAPS will cover many things. TAPS had me set up an appointment with a DAV (Disabled American Veterans - Volunteer Organization) VSO (Veterans Services Officer) and she was able to mark all the things in my medical record that deemed VA disability worthy. Also, if you have trouble sleeping get an appointment with an approved sleep study specialist. There will also be a VA physical and Mental evaluation. A 0 or 10% is better than nothing. Believe me on that. 

As for GI Bill. You should look into the many G.I. Approved education programs. Some people go through 4 years of college and have a career that a certification can cover. Careers that come to mind include several types of technicians, computer programmers, and several supervisory and managerial positions. If you need to get into a career quicker to take care of your family, certifications may be the way to go. The G.I bill will also cover many schools for high end trades.

I did what TAPS recommended and got awarded 80% by the VA. It took 4-5 months to receive it after getting out. I did have a rough 2 months in between getting out and starting school. I do recommend you save as much as you can so that you have some buffer money. I went to college for a couple years but realized it wasn't the career I wanted and quit. I took the week long basic maritime safety course and some other short courses (G.I. Bill covered) and quickly got a job working in the Gulf of Mexico on offshore supply vessels. The pay was pretty good entry level at the time.  4 years later I qualified to test for my engine officer (3rd Assistant Engineers) license. I also had to take a couple engineering officer classes that the GI Bill will cover. Around the same time an instructor, who was retired navy, and I started talking about the VA. He told me to reapply for an increase. I am glad I did because they awarded me 100% P&T. With this type of rating you can still work. I left the Gulf of Mexico soon after that and now I am working deep sea vessels with a union and living in Thailand. The VA has been a blessing for me the entire way.

What is your rate if you don't mind me asking?",r/navy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcDNJLVF4UDlaZWoyZXFBTURiTHppQmxJU0ZQMHpuLXluYnFyMzdKbTFRbFdQSnpBQUJ3dTZPc1Q5Y2tzZmlsWjdSbHZ4WFRRMHdFdTNkU1lTMUlOcjB3anZhWWdCa3M4UVRuYi1JeTR4WTg9
"Braces need to be periodically adjusted to make sure the teeth are lining up correctly. They are also vulnerable to breaking and may need to be repaired.

The Navy does not have orthodontists on ships. Imagine you’re on a six month deployment with braces. Who is going to adjust them or repair them? Not just any dental tech can handle it, and special equipment is required.

Since braces often need to be worn for years, puttting someone on LIMDU until their braces come off is impractical. 

Finally, braces are often for cosmetic purposes. The Navy is not going to pay for/authorize a procedure that renders you non-deployable for years just so your smile is straighter. 

The Navy does take dental health seriously, which is why they mandate getting check ups and annual cleanings. That is separate from orthodontics which makes you more vulnerable to having an issue on deployment, not less.",r/navy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZdnBCZF8tLU96cGZlclRGZzRtWnVrc05MNEo5ZjZ4R0dPZE42R0lONUg2MjVwZGdCQkwyM3ZXRkNLOURNeEZuYlhaQW5rdjJORjVnQmNwdnlBQTQteWlCOXRTYXEzb0lSRnctU19ZOHpNVEU9
"So there's a lot to unpack here.

First off, not every Navy dentist is credentialed to install braces. To tack onto this, most dentists don't want to fuck with braces anyway. That's the job of the orthodontist. Orthodontists are WAY too valuable to be sending out and are kept shoreside unless they're deliberately deployed. These are professionals the Navy desperately wants to retain (which involves not pissing them off) because they're expensive to recruit and replace.

Secondly, it's not just the dentist or orthodontist you're sending out, but their support staff as well. Dentists have to have X number of dental-trained HMs with them and this isn't something you slapdash train folks on, it's a C School certification.

Now take into account what your new tiny dental department on board needs to function. Space for records, space for sterilizing equipment, x-ray equipment, and a place to bolt down a dental chair.

What do we need all this junk for? Stuff goes wrong occasionally with braces, like broken teeth.

Personnel + Equipment + Maintenance for that equipment = more money than the Navy wants to spend.

Braces at sea is overly costly at best and ill-advised at worst.",r/navy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZV0t0bnNDSVU3ZzBQN3gzNHhQa0RibTlNVGswUEo5RWljVFp5TXNMcUp0dDRrSnBpVGVMTEgtMWxteTBTMEVfVjlEaU5rdk1uSS16RDFRdnVjcUZ3bFE9PQ==
"I had a neurologist sign off on mine, saying it could help relieve the tension in my jaw for migraines (I was getting upwards of 10 a month, still am but, eh) and the Navy still wouldn’t give me braces. I was in the DC area so the priority was midshipmen (what I was told) because at that point they were only giving out a certain amount for a fiscal year. This was also the same doctor that wrote in my record “25 y/o male {I’m female} wants braces because they think it will help headaches & to close gap I. front teeth… unnecessary” instead of actually reading what was written on the recommendation. 

What frustrates me about the entire thing, is that I would have been able to get a boob job WAY easier had I wanted that, over braces. And yes, I was on shore duty already. Wasn’t trying to accomplish this on sea, I knew better. 

I ended up doing it on my own for 3.5 years, glad I did in the long run. It sort of did help the migraines, but not as effective in the tension relief as we’d hoped.

Long story short, I know it’s annoying, but wait til shore duty and see if you’re eligible. If not, there are plenty of out in town orthodontists that will take care of you, and they do mil discounts / payment plans / etc.",r/navy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZUVJXeFBxTDhVSHpDQjZhNThjN0tQU3pGOGZRbzNrc045VWl1Q1ZpRkg2c0g2LWpZOVJxR29NdkdUbTFQSWdUSWRFUXZIU25OMlhXYmE0ZXlFbzZwanc9PQ==

It sucks, which is why guys who get shore duties that don't have access to that kind of stuff sort of get boned.  I got 99th percentile on the E6 exam 4 times in a row and my biggest piece of advice is to look through the bibs and categorize them.  As in, look at which subject has the most references.  For example, one cycle I looked through the bibs and the majority of them were related to towed array employment or tactics in some way.  That cued me in that the test was going to be very towed array knowledge heavy, so I just generally studied the shit out of that without really paying too much attention to specific bibs.

"Separate of what others have suggested.  Make a dream sheet of top 3 schools for your preferred career field/major.  

Hint:  look at r100 schools (they get the most research funding and have the most subsequent innovations) as a result of their faculty and PhD candidates leading at the forefront of a given field.

After you've identified the ""where"", apply to Service school (S2S), it's a non-profit that helps service members & veterans prepare for admissions, by pairing you up with a mentor to help you refine your CV/resume, personal statement, essay, etc.  I know Sailors that got accepted to Yale, Brown, Stanford, UCB, and UNLV, with the help of this program.  100% recommend.

Call the VA and ask for an education benefits advisor to explain the differences between MGIB and post-9/11 in detail as it can be confusing.  Payments to you monthly and you pay the institution, or they direct pay the billed tuition amount to the institution.  Both have an annual cap of ~$28k per year for 36 months, if you are at 100%.  This is important because  some private schools have tuition exceeding this, which is where yellow ribbon (gi bill top-off), scholarships and grants come in.  

Think about it this way (hypothetical example with fictitious numbers), if you're competitive to get into Harvard and it costs ~$50k/year, but you shoot low at ASU which costs ~$15k/year.  You're leaving $39k of tuition on the table at the end of 3 years.  Meanwhile, you could be at Harvard maxing out your annual GI bill funding, and just need to find $22k/year ($66k total) in scholarships/grants/fellowships/yellow ribbon for a much better education, alumni, and recognition.  

P.s.  I went to an R100 for my masters with VA education benefits, and got 2x $10k fellowship grants (tuition was $55k for 7 classes).

"I’d be willing to say that perhaps in some rates that are healthy (duty/rank/manpower/etc), the ECM is in a separate swim lane and allows the detailer to conduct business as one would imagine, however an ECM for a unhealthy rate can and will micromanage to course correct. 

We’re effectively speaking nuance and anecdotes but it’s subjective and situationally dependent. 

I saw you’re a CT, I’d be willing to contend that a conversation with the CT detailer would by and large look different than that of the SO to CS to STG. 

Arbitrarily I’ll use STGC; the community health of STGC at Sea was %300 manned in 2023 [STG Community Health](https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Portals/55/Career/ECM/Surface_CS_Ops/07MAY24_STG_B340.pdf?ver=ubMu3AIhgjHHxenlrQ468Q%3d%3d) the ECMs primary focus is to balance the health of the rate including manpower, this would include him instructing STGCs to take shore duty to balance out that %300 at sea. I’m confident a 29 year CT can see how a situation like this will impact a Sailor via Detailer indirectly through the ECM.

***Having said all that, and back to what I see the original comment regarding going up the “COC” an ECM is not going to cater to an individual sailor in the process, there will be blanket considerations but not individual and going to the ECM won’t net anything.

"I was in RTC GL Feb-April 2020. I had the authentic experience for the first two weeks or so before one thing after another started getting shut down. We had a real NWU inspection, a ""socially distant"" NSU inspection, and the dress uniform inspections were canceled. Then they decided to start training the RDCs more, so we did like four practice inspections in all uniforms...because COVID doesn't spread during practices, only real inspections, right?

We did the real firefighting, sidearm turnover, and line handling training, but couldn't practice anything for the last few weeks because all the practice equipment was secured. Unlike inspections, COVID could spread during the practices, but couldn't spread during the test (Battle Stations). Funny how that works.

Our ""masks"" were the neck gaiters and scarves. We even PTd with those on. I think I still have little hairs in my mouth. We were authorized to cut up t-shirts and use the sewing kits to make our own DIY masks, using skivvy elastic for the ear loops, but not everyone did.

The last few weeks were pretty easy physically, but mentally horrible. With all the practice gear secured, all we could do was polish boots, PT, and read through the line handling and firefighting scripts printed out in packets that could magically not transmit COVID. Our YN definitely had it the worst - we were ordered to scrub the compartment top to bottom with bleach twice a day, and she had a serious bleach sensitivity, so she spent the whole time shut in the fishbowl with only the most marginal protection from the fumes, which were enough to give her nosebleeds.

Because the biggest shock was that ""you're an officer with a security clearance, you'll be able to walk into a six-figure job"" is unadulterated weapons-grade bullshit that people who've never worked in industry still believe. 

In the private sector, no one cares what rank you held, and your clearance only matters if you're interested in working very specific jobs in specific places for specific companies. No one else in industry cares.  I'm glad I didn't end up as one of the senior officers or NCOs who gaffs off the transition and gets smacked in the face by reality.

Ship was pretty decent when we went into the yards. The stennis crew was actually 15% ahead of schedule. It's the shitty NNS newport news crew that delayed everything. They have more of the ships work package than we do and when they hire them they are they are not the best hires. Alot of them are lazy sleeping on the job. Not only that we were ahead they took most of the NNS workers and stennis sailors to go work on the george washington who was next door to get them out of the yards so we were not a priority and before that there focus was getting the ford out of there. In my opinion Newport news does a terrible job planning all this. The navy is at the mercy of NNS while there.

"First, I’m sorry that you’ve been going through all of this.

I’m going to take what you wrote at face value. However, due to the complexity of everything you’re explaining, please know that there is likely a ton of nuance to your situation and whavetever people respond here may/may not be relevant. 

That said, I’m going to be straightforward: 

> My provider was not helpful, she didn't believe that I was raped, and said at worse I was just fondled. 

I’m sorry you were not believed. I’m not sure who would think it was appropriate to make this distinction aside from the ER as it pertained to an exam or legal as it pertained to charges. Regardless, supporting you should have been a primary goal. 

> I tried to tell her I was depressed but she said I wasn't, and that I need to get over it. 

This is where some technicalities may have arisen. I don’t know you/the circumstances, etc, *and* when it comes to mental health there are criteria that need to be met for a diagnosis. If you feel you’re not being correctly diagnosed, you can request a second opinion. 

> She also said that I'm not right for the Navy if I'm already depressed. Finally I had, had enough. 

Out of context (I.e. for the typical sailor in A school) this could be true; sounds like given your situation probably not. But, if as you said prior they didn’t believe you met other criteria, that’s how they could have arrived at that decision. I’m not saying that’s the correct decision, just what may have been their logic. 

> I startes talking to a civilian doctor on Doctors On Demand. He diagnosed me with depression, and PTSD from my rape. He also tested me for ADHD, and Autism. Level 1 Autism. He prescribed my some antidepressants. 

You’ve lost me here. This is where the clinician you were seeing may make a difference. A therapist is almost never able to prescribe medication (in a few states, with additional training, and they’re limited in what they can prescribe). A prescriber (psychiatrist, psych np, etc) is almost never going to “test” for anything because that isn’t part of their training. However, they are qualified to diagnose these disorders. I would be surprised if the disorders you’ve listed were all diagnosed a during the same/or very few visits, as (again, face value), if you meet criteria for PTSD it can be hard to parse out other diagnosis due to symptom overlap without a longer period of treatment. This is partially why military providers are skeptical of civilian diagnosis. 

> So, I went back to my provider at medical, and she find let me get evaluated. I told the doctor about my rape, and how I have gone downhill since. She diagnosed me with unspecified personality disorder with anti social features. She wrote in her notes that I was a liar who lies to get ahead. I get recommended for separation.

What was involved in this diagnosis? At this point, given everything going on, I’d imagine they did testing with you as well? If so, they should have gone over the testing report with you. 

> I finally snap, and try to kill myself, and get sent to a psych ward. At the psych ward I was diagnosed with MDD Major Depressive Disorder. I was given meds that worked.

Subjectively, I’m sorry you felt like that was the only option. I hope you’re in a better place, and building up supports as it sounds like whatever direction this goes may be challenging. Objectively (again, just being straight): this can be viewed as further evidence of a personality disorder. 

> I'm still being separated for a personality disorder that two different doctors don't believe I have.

Was the inpatient stay at a military facility, or civilian? The doctors on demand diagnosis won’t hold much weight, but if the inpatient stay was military and/or has good notes, if those aren’t in your medical record, go get them, give them to medical records to scan into your chart. You can try getting your records from doctors on demand and doing the same, idk what their process is. 

> I was told that they would begin the process Monday, abd there is no appeal. I was told this would be a CND discharge.

Again, face value, this is somewhat true. If medical starts the CnD, that recommendation and your medical record are reviewed by 2, sometimes 3 independent providers. So… the system has a built in review. You could also request a second opinion if you have not yet done that. CnD isn’t a discharge status. If all of the providers agree and the CnD is “approved,” it moves to your CO for action. They can decline to take action, or separate. If they separate, they decide the discharge status. So, to review: 3- 4 providers review the record (provider who met with you +2- 3), and then the CO reviews. By the end of the 3 + CO, if they all agree, CO determines how you get out. 

> I feel like a fool, I feel betrayed, and I feel like I should have never reported. I feel like this is only happening because I reported my rape, and sought help for my depression. I feel like a loser, and I don't want to be separated. Since being on the antidepressants I feel better, my command says I'm better but I'm still being separated for a lie.

Hang in there. I’m not sure what’s going on, but I’m glad the antidepressants are helping and you’re doing alright right now. Please continue asking for/getting the support you need. 

> I get no benefits with a CND discharge.

This is untrue, benefits are determined based upon discharge status and service connection. Veterans *always* receive mental health care for a sexual trauma, and I want to say the VA has now extended mental health to everyone. Point being, if this is the most distressing part for you, ask someone who is knowledgeable and/or look on the VA’s website for informed info. 

> I also have reached out to my victims advocate, and he got me in contact with the VLC who set up a meeting with the CO but one of my chiefs said there is no use in speaking to the CO.

This is the direction to go. Follow-up with the VLC. Don’t listen to your chief, instruction changes often and they may/may not have any clue what the instructions says and is going off of sea stories without context. 

> I also have a lawyer, and my family is trying to get me a civilian lawyer too.

There’s a point where having lawyers is overkill; I’d argue 3 would be that point. Especially if you have to pay out of pocket and find someone who knows the UCMJ and ADSEP processes. While I can’t advise on that, I’d ask the other 2 lawyers you “have” what they think.

Your VLC should understand the policies of a CND ADSEP such as electing GCMCA review and the elevated separation authority if you're being separated within a year of your assault.

My father (retired MCPO) reached out to the MCPON and we both collectively said we were going to take it to the media. Well after two weeks, BUPERS and BUMED changed their tune.

Depending on the resources available, the Navy uses network (civilian) resources often. The hospital that you stay at technically should send over documents from your stay, however they don’t always do that. I would go and request your records and get them scanned in.

"So currently recruiting right now on the west coast. Here's what I'll say:

  
I was on sea duty for 7 1/2 years, 3 deployments including a covid cruise. You have your positives & negatives

  
Positives: When you see your future sailors become better people, better leaders, it really touches your soul. I have enjoyed giving advice to my people and seeing them be better for it. Finding a community like I have and people that you know are on the fence of going into gangs, being into drugs and helping them get their life back on track. That is the stuff that makes it worth it.

  
I also have at least been able to come home to my wife & dog every day. Yes, late days, some REALLY late days, but at least I get to see them every day, so I'll take that vs being on deployment

  
Also, if you stay in, it looks fantastic on your record. I had a real close friend who got a P eval as a first class over here, submit his package and get picked up for chief. So if you survive, oh baby it will look fantastic. Even if you are getting out, you have a lot of opportunity for networking with people that will set you up nicely when you are out.

  
Negatives: Remember when I said if you survive? That if is no shit legit IF.

  
There will be moments where you look up and ask yourself if this is truly real life. I have seen situations that have quite literally made me vomit. You also deal with leadership that I'll say 8/10 times, is at the VERY best, questionable. 

  
I have tried going to online college, and I am not giving up, but working 50-60 hours per week, probably 30-35 of those hours driving, coming home & playing husband and dog father, and then making sure all your future sailors are gtg, all while trying to get some sort of sleep, is so hard. 

  
The most difficult part, is your first year though. I am not from the west coast, so I had to establish relationships, find what my niche is. I, for one, take a lot of pride in everything I did in my rate, be able to pickup on it relatively quickly. I didn't pick up my niche until the very end of my first year, so the growing pains and the constant push, it was VERY difficult for me.

  
In conclusion, while recruiting even today has its challenges for me, and looking back at everything that happened, I will always be of the mindset that everything happens for a reason. I have about a year to go, and can tell you that I now have the confidence that I can do every job imaginable. So if you are up for a challenge and think you can handle it with all that I have said, by all means give it a go.",r/navy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNabnV6M3hWcVdzS1J0U3VFMFdZVjRUWWNDUnA5SmY0ckF6a1hER1B5cm1IeEJVc2d1d0E4OW53dWFkaWVtZGJ6SDZYUUZQVmhieHlBV0JkN1F5T0RxeUlYNnotb1JJQXpmeFVDUkdabWFiQTA9

"Not having to ""sir"" this and ""sir"" that.  It took me a long time to unlock. 

Then about 17 years after I resigned, I ran into a USAF BGEN (Robert ""Surf"" Beletic) when he visited my USG agency. He had given me a ride on an F16D when he was a young 1st LT.  I started talking to him about the old days/old base, and used the word ""dude' in our conversation.  

His aide, a LTCOL, casually hinted that ""dude"" was a wrong noun to use with a BGEN.  

I mulled about it for 2 sec and said ""...you can go fuck yourself"".

"I've read a number of replies to this effectively dogpiling on OP for being displeased with their current living conditions because it can (and often if not normally does) get much more austere at operational commands. While this may be objectively true, it does nothing to help this Sailor, nor does it make our service any stronger in terms of likely retention of this person when their time comes to choose whether to stay or go.

u/Technical-Wrangler90 I understand your frustrations. For what it's worth, when I was in A School in 2010, they had us in 5-man rooms where the 5th person had a tiny ""echo"" locker rather than a real closet. It was a bummer, but we made it work. Consider leaning into the challenges of itty bitty living space as you're likely going to deal with more cramped quarters if you're headed to a big gray floaty boi after your tenure at Great Lakes. All of this is training, some by design, some as a matter of happy (or unhappy, depending on your perspective) coincidence.

On that note, that's really what watch standing while in A School is for--training. You're not armed, you're not (I'm guessing based on my own experience eons ago) in direct contact with the base ASF. But you're challenging people on or near your post ad nauseam. Feels silly, right? On some level, yeah it's silly and certainly frustrating. After all, it's burning what limited free time you have and also making it harder to fully apply yourself in class, right? The thing is, you're being trained for the fleet, and in the fleet you're probably going to be in a duty section of some sort and have side quests and big boy watches that make it more challenging to keep up with your primary duties.

Based on u/Technical-Wrangler90 replies, it sounds like you're a fleet returnee. A School is designed to mass produce apprentice level Sailors in their various ratings. Most of them will be new accession Sailors. They're too busy with that mission to make a ton of exception for fleet returnees. Keep pressing forward and keep your grades up and get a dope billet on the other side.

"Assuming you are talking about the handguard rivets, the original 1861 models apparently had ten, whereas many repros have 11.  

There's a balance to be had in securing the bowl to the handguard.

"You can do the BDD program 180 days prior to separation date - usually get the VA rating within 30 days of separation. File for unemployment as soon as you separate while looking for jobs or even attending college. VA Disability and GI Bill pay in arrears - just like the military is paying you in arrears right now and civilian jobs pay you. If your classes start 15 August, you get paid for 16 days of MHA at the end of August - you only get paid for the dates school is in session - same thing will happen at the end of the semester - if classes end 5 December, you only get paid for 5 days at the end of December - so you have to budget your money. VA doesn't pay for partial months so the first payment for VA disability would be the end of August for being rated for the month of August. Do the FASFA application to see if you qualify for Pell Grants - free money from the Department of Education.

"I have CARs from both OEF and OIF and a PH from OEF. I am still a reservist but I will give you my perspective. I went to Iraq in 2005 we had the Marine Ball soon after we returned. If you did not have a CAR everyone kind of scoffed. We had all been out for 7 months driving around waiting to get hit with IEDs and getting in firefights. There was a level of skepticism from guys because we had lost 2 guys in our platoon and had quite a few PHs from that deployment. 

The issue is then we came home there was always some POG who wanted to prove a point that they could mess with us. I got into with an Admin bc they were being assholes not doing their job. Both were the same rank and she gives me an attitude and says “I’ve been to Iraq too.” My response is nobody gives a fuck what you did in Iraq. Someone stepped in and apologized.

"An itinerary for blowing the Navy’s hair back for retaliation against a service member who reported sexual assault:

First stop:  House Oversight Committee.



Second stop: Office of Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. 



Third stop: Offices of your own House and Senate members (they may or may not give a shit depending who they are, and technically they should be your first stop, but I don’t want a potentially discouraging experience to keep you from moving forward).



Final stop: Hire outside attorney to represent you if you want to fight this (you should). Bottom line is these diagnoses were applied in a discriminatory fashion because the Navy didn’t want to deal with you.

Unless you are pouring laxatives into your colleagues’ coffee, keying their cars, et cetera, I’m having trouble understanding where a diagnosis of “anti-social” is coming from. Additionally, to meet diagnostic criteria, these types of behaviors would need to be evident prior to the sexual assault incident in order for such a diagnosis to be reliable. 

Unfortunately, I don’t know of a single woman who was never called a liar after reporting sexual assault, either inside or outside military.

A friend complains that someone SA’d her, so I tell her to file a complaint to the command. She does and E8 tells us all “she shouldn’t have said anything because now it’s giving us a bunch of trouble.” Were riders on a ship, so when we get to port, i have to turn in our training documents to HQ, but the ship has an all hands. I can’t do both so E8 says I can go to HQ and I’ll be fine. I go to HQ, but I’m gone from the all hands. I go to DRB XOI and mast while we’re underway, everyone says I’ll get a chance to explain myself. I never get to argue my case, and being a rider, I can’t request court martial.

"Edit: warning: this turned into a long one. Sorry. 

>be me

Nah, just kidding. 

Anyway it was about a month after I got qualified 3M maintenance person on the boat, and about 6 months since I had checked in. 

I was on a VA class sub. Our division (nuke ETs) owned all the upper level ventilation maintenance in sked for some reason. EVERYONE blazed that thing. It was explained to me as: get a shop vac, vacuum out the filter so it looks good and that’s it. (Spoilers - that’s not what the MRC card said)

So anyway my nub ass gets a spot check with the CO and XO on the vent filters. I think my chief at the time (huuuge asshole I had my whole tour by the way) thought that vent filters would be a safe bet for a spot check. Nobody would ever fuck that up, right?

So anyway, I fucked that up. Badly. 

The XO ate the shit that I served him when I talked about the vacuum cleaners satisfying the MRC with a smile on his face. I don’t think he listened to a single word I said before he congratulated me on an awesome spot check. The CO was a different story, however…

So in my excellent planning for this spot check, I had only printed the “parent” MRC. It directs you to child MRCs for different ways to clean the filters (one of which was “low pressure air” - important later). The CO immediately questioned why the hell I only brought the parent procedure. I told him that low pressure air was what I used, and that was just a step in the MRC. I also explained that “low pressure air” meant vacuum cleaners. I mean after all, it’s the lowest pressure air you can get. Skipper didn’t like that train of thought either, though I did genuinely believe it mostly. Needless to say I failed that spot check. 

In the “what the fuck was that” meeting that the chain of command had afterwards my Divo had my back pretty good explaining to everyone that I wasn’t purposefully not doing it right, just dumb. To be completely fair it was beyond stupid of me to raw dog a spot check with the CO like that and it must’ve seemed almost insulting to him that I brought the parent MRC and nothing else. I 100% should have just grabbed the whole procedure and done it right in the first place. 

By the way, low pressure air? Meant SHIP’S low pressure air. My chief made sure to give me all the vent filters for the next year or so.",r/navy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnV3phNThCMzJaUkd2c2U4eVlNR2M3SEYxc3pmWk81dE5NckdxcEJNV09lOWdRYXNLQWstU2hlZ1dmcDY5X283Y0FEZHlSYlBpUU84RVdDSXdVTkhDR1E9PQ==

"I transferred to a CVN and became the METCAL manager for the ship as an E-5 (normally it’s an E-6/7 role). One of the first things you do when you take over is a full inventory of all calibration standards (what we use to calibrate gear). I finished the inventory for all the gear but I could NOT find like 16 pieces of gear. I looked high and low and employed all of my sailors on both shifts for nearly a week tearing apart every inch of every space we owned and never found the standards.

I tell my LPO and LCPO and they both blow it off and tell me “we clearly haven’t needed them so don’t worry about it”. Well I wanted the best calibrations lab in the navy so I told them I would file the proper requests to TYCOM to get new items so we would be at 100% and I did. 

The next day TYCOM is sending me email after email in full caps asking me things like “ARE YOU AN IDIOT? IS THIS YOUR FIRST DAY IN THE NAVY?” And more things along that line. At the same time, TYCOM is losing it at my LPO and LCPO who are losing it at me and starting to blame me for “losing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gear”. I obviously objected and showed that I literally just arrived and couldn’t have possibly lost that many items. After a few months all of the items I requested showed up and all inventories were updated. A few months after that we went through AMI (super in depth inspection by E-8s and above from all over the navy on your programs, it’a an AIMD thing I believe). I was the ONLY program to get perfect marks across the board and I was the first person to ever score perfectly with those inspectors. My ENTIRE chain of command from HOD down came and reinspected my programs 3-4 more times and couldn’t find anything. Well my LPO and LCPO caught a lot of shit since I made it apparent to every inspector that it was all me and they did their admin duties only. So they were pretty pissy with me for quite a while after that. But fuck em, I worked my ass off and destroyed my mental health to get that score so they can suck it.",r/navy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnLTJIWlpHNm8yRnlKWE5qWEJ4eTlkUTdEbkNsb1pLeG1GeHhyZE1iWE9zUVZ1SUxlSVhiaHg2OG05SXdNUGo1aTd5OE9FaTFINUJVWWs3T3kwUi1lSGc9PQ==

"The shopping cart theory. Source 4chan

The shopping cart is the ultimate litmus test for whether a person is capable of self-governing.

To return the shopping cart is an easy, convenient task and one which we all recognize as the correct, appropriate thing to do. To return the shopping cart is objectively right. There are no situations other than dire emergencies in which a person is not able to return their cart. Simultaneously, it is not illegal to abandon your shopping cart. Therefore the shopping cart presents itself as the apex example of whether a person will do what is right without being forced to do it. No one will punish you for not returning the shopping cart, no one will fine you or kill you for not returning the shopping cart, you gain nothing by returning the shopping cart. You must return the shopping cart out of the goodness of your own heart. You must return the shopping cart because it is the right thing to do. Because it is correct.

A person who is unable to do this is no better than an animal, an absolute savage who can only be made to do what is right by threatening them with a law and the force that stands behind it.

The Shopping Cart is what determines whether a person is a good or bad member of society.",r/navy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnVDFGb2FZT0NTR1VTQ3FaVFJlUENOMTZrSVlZWC16bEdWWTJFOHdjZktyRmdQZDVSX2MtVzNsXzM5TlgzV19Nb255WDRHRldrLVBSWUxLOFZjN01hRmc9PQ==

"Doesn’t help that DFAS runs off of a 60 year old programming language (COBOL), they tried to reform it a few years ago, spent a few billion and gave up. DFAS is running off some ungodly number of official manual work arounds at this point.

While they mostly did (finally), it’s still got a couple zombies wandering around (thanks theater-AHLTA). And no one’s super stoked about what they killed it with (Genesis).

"Well I think you be surprised all the bad shit social workers been through to want to work in such a dark field you got human trafficking victims , veterans , child youth protective services having to protect children from being exploited and abused. Working with people incarcerated or mentally unstable people and having to work with all different kinds of people . I think sometimes you need someone who is a little tough to have to deal with such dark topic that most people don’t have to deal with on a daily basis. Regular people don’t understand what it’s like to walk around in a world where you seen the darkest parts of human nature and what people are capable of being and I think having that kind of understanding and acceptance that other people aren’t going to understand where dark humor comes from is what I think can make a difference because we don’t always need a shiny person who is always happy and cheerful we need people who are realistic enough to tell their clients there are going to be shitty days where you are going to have ptsd and you aren’t going to alway feel like you’re old self and that it’s ok if you feel a little fucked up because you been through shit and have someone who knows and understands that concept is what matters because there are many people who feel exactly the same way and they don’t have anyone to relate to them. I think that why people should be hiring social workers in all kinds of different backgrounds from all walks of life because they have the skills to work in the community and problem solve world problems . There just isn’t much respect for social workers and what they could be capable of doing if they had better support and back up from the government to help and support people.

"As someone who joined the navy later in life (31 years old, to be exact).  I didn't join out of any sense of patriotism or sense of duty.  Rather, I was longing for a change of pace and environment.

"Hot take: your Sailors aren’t struggling with motivation, you’re struggling to connect with them. 

My guess is that you’re motivated by the act of service. Many (in my experience, most) Sailors don’t even rank that in the top five. 

You have to work with your people to figure out  what motivates them. Sometimes, they know what that is, sometimes they don’t. Sometimes motivations change. Sometimes, people are motivated by things you just can’t wrap your head around. 

I’ve found that, for a wide variety of reasons, my Sailors aren’t often motivated by the same things I am. Finding a way to bridge that gap is the most important task for a leader. 

It’s cool that you take pride in the service to country aspect of the job, but that shouldn’t mean everyone else has to share that with you.",r/navy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnSjFaVXpnWC1vVzN3a2dyOU5RUHoxc19mZWtGX0RFX3l0Z212Y1lHWmdZeFV5b0RfTjlkcTRWSGJmSmRLVzU5OUdIWjR1UGhvLTZyeUNiczJUM3RKZlE9PQ==

"It's both. It was an honor to serve and work with some awesome folks. However, at the end of the day. It is just a job. The big Navy machine will chew you up and move on without you. 

It's important to remember it's the military and sometimes shit sucks and just has to get done. But the younger generation of today was raised with massive amounts of information at their fingertips. They want to the why behind everything because they've always been able to find the why.

Yah a lot of people just need to suck it up and get over it. But sometimes they have valid concerns. And I found that when you take the 2 minutes to explain why it's that way and why YOU can't do anything to change it they usually respect that.

"Arlington/Marysville/Smokey Point are probably the most “middle” between the two, but good lord that I-5 traffic from Seattle to Arlington can be a nightmare!

The ferry’s aren’t very cheap and if it’s too windy or low tide stays too long they’ll cancel trips so I’d avoid having to use those to get on the island. 

I had people that lived in Everett or even Seattle and commuted, it’s doable, but again if you hit traffic wrong you’ll spend more time in your car than at work.",r/navy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnS2hIMmFLTXhzUS1FUkhVMGNLaWM4cFJlZTVZLXdwWWtuNGM5YkJWblpBOU96bDNIbGJMS0pPUUNYMmNaMGQzLU1yZ2xWaExHSmtrOTg1VGo5Nmo5emhyYnN6Tm45cXlwMEpveWVJMFpHcHM9

">couldn’t be arsed

Sir, could you do me a favor and bring back a family size bag of Malteesers when you come back from the UK? I could buy them here, but it just doesn't taste the same, you know?

But seriously, it should be no secret that all levels leadership should always make appreciation public and berating/punishing private. I can proudly say that I take care of my Sailors that way and that I make the genuine effort so that others will, too.
