> \\# How can an adversary even get hundreds or thousands of sessions?

> The idea is that remote peering providers and VPS providers (e.g., Vultr) enable the adversary to quickly and cheaply 'click together' (virtual) ports at many (think 20+) different peering LANs. The adversary obtains transit by picking providers that also establish transit sessions over peering LANs (Hurricane Electric being the prime example), many bi-lateral peering sessions via openly/aggressively peering networks (that can be identified via, e.g., PeeringDB), and additional (less effective) sessions via multi-lateral peering with Route Servers. Surprisingly, while it would be hard to assemble enough sessions with just one port at each peering LAN (yet eventually doable), this limitation does not exist in reality; while certain providers directly allow clicking multiple ports for a single peering LAN, there are also multiple providers---this allows the adversary to obtain a 5X to 10X factor for its session counts by establishing multiple sessions to each neighbor (in fact each port of each neighbor).",r/netsec,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHQU0weUVXNy0yNkRTUTFPNGN6bWxSckVPS1lIdHpzd2FvNGNMZEFZZHJPWnVEMWVMa0JsdUhLcHNrNzhUUXJ3eGNudjY5czhBOW1pYmVjcHJUaGExMmc9PQ==

This tool generates code that calls the syscalls directly (on target langs where this is possible). You can also optionally use libc (to not hardcode the syscall number), but it's not required.

"This is not bad, but there are a few points I would add:

* Access-Control-Allow-Origin of * prevents cookies from going up.  It is an unfortunately too common mistake that websites might reflect the origin from the browser Host header rather than using the wildcard case, which is safer than reflecting the origin.  There are some unfortunate libraries that have had the reflected origin vulnerability (gorilla/handlers being one).
* The end section about using custom headers to prevent GET requests from changing state — the better option is to not allow GET requests to change state rather than doing bandaid patches with custom headers.  GET requests are not supposed to be state changing.
* The statement at the beginning is wrong: “*But thankfully, this scenario will not happen. And it’s all thanks to CORS*”.  No, it’s due to the Same Origin Policy.  CORS is not a security feature, instead CORS is a relaxation of the built-in Same Origin policy.  CORS reduces security to allow functionality that the Same Origin Policy would otherwise prohibit.  The trick with CORS is to make sure you don’t reduce it too much, and the most dangerous scenario is reflecting origins with Access-Control-Allow-Credentials set to true.",r/netsec,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXUVBBRVVyU1FQSjhPMkQxeUh0NWJsSHZnSkdGQjExQUlHdGZ0QXNJck5oTzJtczVtenMxanNMMHlsbVFuRUU3Q2lFNU1DUEQySnA1SUFta3VRTWNmdVE9PQ==

"I'm not sure how to feel about this. First of all, it serves as an exmaple why you should NEVER copy or paste any credentials into your source code, NEVER. Not for testing, not for internal projects, NEVER. If you really have to, read them from some ephemeral place like OUTSIDE credential files, env vars, stdin or inject them with a http proxy.

Also one of the takeaways seems wrong. Github decided to only allow ""new"" tokens to be scoped to projects. But these tokens have to expire, you can't set them to never expire. I'm not going to replace 3 tokens every week. This is the equivalent of forcing users to change their password every month. It's not going to happen. No one is going to replace their CI tokens every month or so.

So actually, this token could indeed have limited access if Github would allow to disable token expiry for new tokens.

But those are nuances. I don't realistically see how this could have been prevented. Being more restrictive with access tokens doesn't make it impossible to leak them by accident. You do have to interface with external APIs and there is no way to test these interactions without puttin in real tokens at some point.",r/netsec,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYRVB5VUUtZ3NEaU5rdHB0OG9yZTRFVFZUcWdlOGliQjREQ3p1bGxKQUxJaU1pV0hoTndOeEt0RTl5UVZzSFF4VUJoLTU2VmZjNm5jQjE3Q0FLd0VUemc9PQ==
