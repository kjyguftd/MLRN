AFAIK everything neuralink does was already possible using utah arrays. The only significant improvement is the implantation method and the materials which are intended to reduce scarring/biofouling.

Utah arrays are literally just a grid of spikes shoved into your brain after all but they've been around a long time and can get the same quality data until their function degrades from scarring and biofouling.

If Utah arrays didn't cause scarring and stop working we'd probably have had something like Neuralink awhile ago but as of now the FDA only allows them to be implanted in a brain for 30 days or less.

"Which are fundamental constraints on suitability as a BCI. What’s the point of a BCI that can only be implanted for 30 days at a time? The theory points to the important thing for BCI is that the bulk of the processing of the interfacing is offloaded to the brain by exploiting the neuro plasticity of the brain. 

Short time frames severely limit the degree to which the brain can adjust and integrate with the interface. It’s very hard to even develop say teaching methods for speeding along the integration when you don’t have long term data. You can’t ever build up on previous success.

"So you're agreeing with me and the above post you ranted at then?

As it stands it's literally just a basic modification to the electrode array intended to improve its lifespan that does not offer any improvements to its capabilities and functionality.

That is, Neuralink is a step forward towards better and longer lasting brain implants, but it's just a shuffle side to side where its ability to interface with the brain is concerned and it'd be disingenuous to present it as more than that.

You'd have a point if Neuralink could do something that hasn't been done already for years and years, i.e., something like incorporating an optogenetic feedback system by transfecting cells on the surface of the cerebral cortex, then layering a flexible LED display over them to create a non-scarring high-resolution computer-->brain interface.",r/neuralink,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTcENkZnlWMDl4NTJ2V3hXVF9BM1Foc0lDVldKZFBPNTNJOHlOX0F0NGVpbUpvaUl6eEs0RjZKS1d3bXZ6c2VWY2xVNHExMUR1RnpYWElFblFqUkFwdWQ2XzgyVEF3MGZ5bTNVM2VGcEVkWlE9

"It's called optogenetics and it's commonly used to control and observe neural activity - it basically involves modifying neurons using an adeno-associated virus (these create a sort of fake nucleus containing the virus' payload instead of injecting themselves into your DNA all willy-nilly) that lets researchers control the excitation and inhibition of neurons very precisely using light and even receive/record neuron activity through light as well. The tech has been around for awhile now, at least 20 years.

While it hasn't been used in humans yet, animal testing has validated its potential and there are already some projects that seek to incorporate the methods of optogenetics for creating less invasive higher bandwidth/resolution neural interfaces for implants.

For example, creating prosthetic eyes to cure blindness by modifying retinal ganglion cells that normally just transmit signals from photoreceptors to the visual cortex so that they can be activated or inhibited with an implanted LED array (which thanks to LED displays can already be produced with extremely high resolution) as though they were photoreceptors using data sent from external cameras.

There have even been some two-way interfaces that use genetically encoded calcium indicators. There are many types and variants of GECI but as as an example, one technique causes neurons to produce a protein that fluoresces in near-infrared but gets dimmer when calcium binds to it which allows sensors to measure neural activity in real-time since neural excitation requires activation of voltage-gated calcium channels and rapid ion concentration changes that can be detected.

Optogenetic methods allow you to use fiberoptic wires and arrays to record, trigger, and inhibit neural activity and have achieved single neuron resolutions. Implantable optogenetic fiber optic wire with single digit micron thickness exists already.

One unique advantage of this method over electrode arrays is that optogenetic interfaces offload and distribute work that would otherwise be performed by your implant onto the neurons themselves which lets you transmit and receive data through wires that are nothing more than invisibly thin dumb light tubes.

I think the above demonstrates that despite your earlier comment, the Neuralink is not actually running up against fundamental limitations of BCI and as a BCI isn't doing anything new at all. It's a straightforward implementation of the typical microelectrode array approach with a modified array that can't do anything that hasn't already been done before and fails to do some things that have been done before.

Though, again, it is innovative as a product/implantable medical device if not in its actual brain interfacing ability.",r/neuralink,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTcEhMV0FsVG9zT2t5YVVDU080SEg0SWk5SkE4NnVfUGk2Y0lhOXhYaVhYTThoUV9IX0VaLWkwWThZLTkxekQ1N0U3MG5jYm1NaVRsN1BHY0dYSzN6ZkczX1EzTlZqbDFjU05JRGlsQkpPUG89

"I do want to point out that first human trials have already fallen behind what I thought at the time. But on rereading your post, I want to add something to my comment that was left unsaid, because it already felt like piling-on. But it was something I did consider when I gave that 30++ yr assessment. 

Your comment implies that the implants will have stimulation of some sort built in. But just stimulating neural tissue in any way is an extremely open area of research. Particularly when it comes to medical safety. 

Providing input to a brain, let alone a human brain, is not even an open area of research yet. Beyond mass-stimulation effects that are designed to excite or suppress a large neural population. The only area that has some research behind it, very crude and from at least three decades ago, is the well-structured visual cortex. Thus my remarks about blind people.  *Edit: And of course the very successful application of cochlear implants, but arguably that’s nerve stimulation not brain.*

Having any sort of structured stimulation in any area of the brain, past the point of viability which has not been even approached yet, not only resets the regulatory clock but can put it a few decades behind just on its own.",r/neuralink,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTRmlxVm9XX3BtaEpwSk5MT1RITno0bUlSMmQ0TDNtRS1BRWJULTd0a184Vy1xWWFDR3J0SjIxTXA4N09fSkotN1h2Vm9OTUJscnpxLVBxMzNTT2pCbHc9PQ==

Finally, you've recognized that we have the technology for an implant to write 'some data' to the brain, and the brain then decodes what the information means. 


So now that you've come to that same conclusion and you've watched the video where a nural link in a pig does exactly that. We are done. The entire argument you were trying to make was that ""neural link can't do that"" and ""we don't have the technology.

It seems you don’t understand… you see neurological science is actually quite complex. What they were using was processing image and stimulating the optical nerve in certain ways. It required dozens of computer and a LOT of money and effort. It was not at all feasible. You would need A LOT more than a brain chip to simply do that.

Nerve stimulation has been around a long time. It’s simply just not capable of much at all yet. It may help with very minor things like eye sight. But controlling people’s brains as you supposed which is EXACTLY what you reference is physically almost impossible. A hacker would not be able to remotely stimulate someone’s brain.

"Eye sight is minor 😭😭 

Sit down for a second and look out a window. Do you see how much detail and how much information your brain is processing. Try to describe exactly what you see to yourself in so much detail that you could recreate exactly what your seeing. Wow that's a lot of data your brain is handling. Pretty minor ey? 

Why can't a hacker remotely stimulate a person's brain

Brain > nural link > Bluetooth > phone > internet. 

That gives you 3 entry points to get to the neural link. 

Assume the nural link is installed in someone like the pig in the video.
From there, the individual who has remote access could send a signal to the device interfaces with the nural link  which then tells the nural link to ""stimulate a thread"" as happens in the video",r/neuralink,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTZXJ1cUl6ZkRiQ1Jqd2RjM25sT2xWckl1blI2ZGppU29KQnRKOW84MEk3RjE4STExZ0s1bGxDS1N6VDhkc2U1OVJMZjdWOFF1U3hoM3BORmFmZnZCX1E9PQ==
