"My understanding is that he could, but that whoever would be doing the killing is not immune themselves and is also not protected from following unlawful orders. Question is, is an order from the president still considered unlawful if the president issuing the order is immune from any legal repercussions?

"### My Analysis of the Project 2025 Letter

As a lifelong Democrat and atheist, I approached Kevin D. Roberts' ""A Promise to America"" with a critical eye. Here is my synthesized reading of the foreword letter by the author, focusing on his key issues and strategic views on government.

**Key Issues Highlighted by the Author**

1. **Family Stability and Protection**
   - **Issue**: The crisis of fatherlessness and family breakdown.
   - **Quote**: ""The next conservative President must get to work pursuing the true priority of politics—the well-being of the American family.""

2. **Reducing Government Size and Bureaucratic Overreach**
   - **Issue**: The expansive and unaccountable administrative state.
   - **Quote**: ""The Administrative State holds 100 percent of its power at the sufferance of Congress, and its insulation from presidential discipline is an unconstitutional fairy tale spun by the Washington Establishment to protect its turf.""

3. **National Sovereignty and Border Security**
   - **Issue**: Open borders and illegal immigration.
   - **Quote**: ""The United States belongs to 'We the people.' All government authority derives from the consent of the people, and our nation’s success derives from the character of its people.""

4. **Economic Revival and Energy Independence**
   - **Issue**: Economic stagnation and dependency on foreign energy.
   - **Quote**: ""America’s vast reserves of oil and natural gas are not an environmental problem; they are the lifeblood of economic growth.""

5. **Protecting Individual Liberties and Constitutional Rights**
   - **Issue**: Erosion of individual rights and freedoms.
   - **Quote**: ""The next conservative President must defend our First Amendment rights.""

6. **Combatting Cultural and Ideological Threats**
   - **Issue**: The influence of woke culture and progressive ideologies in institutions.
   - **Quote**: ""The noxious tenets of 'critical race theory' and 'gender ideology' should be excised from curricula in every public school in the country.""

**Geopolitics and Taxes**

**Geopolitics**:
Roberts is highly critical of China, viewing it as a totalitarian enemy engaged in a strategic and economic Cold War against America. He condemns American corporations for their economic engagement with China, which he believes undermines U.S. national security and economic independence. He advocates for energy independence and a robust national defense to counter global threats.

**Taxes**:
Roberts calls for tax reforms that support family stability by eliminating marriage penalties and promoting economic freedom through pro-growth policies. He stresses the importance of protecting the tax-exempt status of churches and charities against progressive ideologies.

**2x2 Matrices on Government Views**

**Option 1: Urgency vs. Impact of Government Actions**

|                      | **Immediate**                              | **Long-term**                             |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **High Impact**      | **Immediate, High Impact**: Addressing family stability, border security, and reducing government size. | **Long-term, High Impact**: Economic revival, energy independence, and protecting individual liberties. |
| **Low Impact**       | **Immediate, Low Impact**: Quick fixes to bureaucratic inefficiencies.  | **Long-term, Low Impact**: Incremental changes in education or minor regulatory adjustments. |

**Option 2: Area of Focus vs. Degree of Government Intervention**

|                      | **High Intervention**                       | **Low Intervention**                       |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Economic Focus**   | **High Intervention, Economic**: Strategic economic policies, heavy regulation for energy independence, and domestic manufacturing revival. | **Low Intervention, Economic**: Promoting free-market principles, reducing economic regulations. |
| **Social Focus**     | **High Intervention, Social**: Active policies to protect family stability, secure borders, and remove woke ideologies from education. | **Low Intervention, Social**: Emphasizing individual liberties and minimal government role in social issues. |

**My Take on the Separation of Church and State**

While Roberts emphasizes protecting the tax-exempt status of churches and promoting family values often associated with religious beliefs, I did not get the impression that he aims to erode the separation between church and state. His focus seems more on safeguarding religious institutions' rights rather than pushing for a theocratic government. The emphasis is on protecting individual liberties and preventing government overreach, which aligns with a broad interpretation of upholding constitutional principles without explicitly merging church and state.

"A meme just got posted to another subreddit that attributes various extreme positions to *Mandate for Leadership*. In particular, the section on the Department of Justice is claimed to ""end civil rights and DEI protections in government"", ""end marriage equality"", and ""eliminate unions and worker protections."" I was interested to know if these statements are actually made in the section so spent an amount of time reading through it. Here is my analysis.

The section on the Department of Justice opens with a list of complaints about the feds unfairly targeting conservatives, half of which involve the FBI (pp.545-547). They then lay out their plan to resolve this alleged political imbalance.

The first concrete step, besides the general calls for institutional review and internal structural reorganization that appears throughout Project 2025, is:

> Prohibit the FBI from engaging, in general, in activities related
to combating the spread of so-called misinformation and disinformation by Americans who are not tied to any plausible criminal activity. ... The United States government and, by extension, the FBI have absolutely no business policing speech, whether in the public square, in print, or online. The First Amendment prohibits it. 

Project 2025 is correct that a fundamental principle of government-funded speech has been to avoid any appearance of involvement in political discourse; we can see this in how VoA was prohibited from operating within the borders of the US from [1948 to 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Mundt_Act). However, if we're talking about the FBI, its actual history has been replete with propaganda and the manipulation of public opinion from the very beginning. If Project 2025 wishes to resolve this possible contradiction, they have a lot of work ahead and I wish them luck. If this is a hypocritical plan to manipulate public opinion in the other direction, I do not wish them luck.

Another Project 2025 initiative strikes me as strange:

> Rigorously prosecute as much interstate drug activity as
possible, including simple possession of distributable quantities.

By this they mean restarting enforcement of federal scheduling laws, which have been allowed to lapse in many circumstances. This would be extremely unpopular, including with conservatives: for instance, [88% of Americans believe marijuana should be legal in some circumstances](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/03/26/most-americans-favor-legalizing-marijuana-for-medical-recreational-use/). I doubt this part of Project 2025 will be enacted, and it is telling that this is one of their main suggestions for combating MS-13.

Several pages deal with the vital national question of baking cakes or creating websites for gay marriages, but there is no direct attack on same-sex marriage. Much more space is devoted to abortion rights:

> **Announc[e] a Campaign to Enforce the Criminal Prohibitions in 18 U.S. Code §§ 1461 and 1462 Against Providers and Distributors of Abortion Pills That Use the Mail**. Federal law prohibits mailing “[e]very article, instrument, substance, drug, medicine, or thing which is advertised or described in a manner calculated to lead another to use or apply it for producing abortion.” Following the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs, there is now no federal prohibition on the enforcement of this statute. The Department of Justice in the next conservative
Administration should therefore announce its intent to enforce federal law against providers and distributors of such pills.

This section of the US code has its roots in the (in)famous [Comstock Act of 1873](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comstock_Act_of_1873). It is indeed within the mandate of the DoJ to enforce such laws, and was famously done so by Anthony Comstock (1844-1915) to halt the distribution of women's suffrage newspapers including contraceptive advertisements.

Another section complains that the FACE Act, a law signed by Clinton in 1994 protecting the entrances to abortion clinics, should not be enforced:

> By engaging in disparate and viewpoint-based enforcement of an already controversial law like the FACE Act against pro-life activists, the DOJ has needlessly undermined its credibility with law-abiding people of faith.

The DoJ indeed has the right to stop enforcing this law.

I did not find that  ""end civil rights and DEI protections in government"", ""end marriage equality"", and ""eliminate unions and worker protections"" were major parts of this section. This section focuses on red-meat religious conservative issues such as the drug war, abortion clinics, abortion pills, Christian bakeries and immigration. It mainly limits itself to choices the DoJ could make in order to appeal to religious conservatives. While these choices may seem abhorrent and indeed might be unpopular with most Americans, they are largely not a novel use of DoJ powers but simply suggest a return to bygone types of enforcement.

Belated edit: Another part of the meme which is now being widely circulated and repeated is that this section ""defunds the FBI"". In fact, it states that funds should be redistributed from the FBI head office to local branch offices, presumably with the goal of slowing ""political/administrative state"" activities in DC and speeding up law enforcement in local areas. It does not call to decrease FBI funding as a whole.",r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPcXJnOHVHOWdtSDM5S1lta3NObWhKNXdYdk5ieGxXc2VaLVN5Ykl5Vl9pLWZWc3VwcDlVNm1KbHRkbmhQb1E0allROW85WmlSdjhfdExZM3N5SzUxUGc9PQ==
"I've worked in the intelligence community and knew better than to think that anything unclassified would be useful, lol.  Regardless you've outlined some broad strokes and seemed to have some interesting questions and contentions.

---

> they call out the CIA as being essentially autonomous from the ODNI.

Yeah the DNI was originally created as a response to 9/11 in order to streamline interagency communications.  Originally the [director of the CIA was the head of the intelligence community.](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10470/12)  [Rumsfeld had a beef with the CIA](https://www.voanews.com/a/a-13-a-2002-10-26-21-rumsfeld/391939.html) and decided to neuter it to whatever extent he could, hence the creation of the DNI.  It would thus make sense there is likely some animosity between the CIA and the DNI.

---

>“*implement the President’s intelligence priorities*”. I think that something as critical as the nation’s intelligence community should be a more bureaucratic and merit-driven enterprise. It should be tasked with informing the president (and other leaders), but this quote makes me think that the author is arguing that it should be more at the whim of the president.

[Just about all parts of the intelligence community report to cabinet level positions,](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/what-we-do/members-of-the-ic) primarily the DOD but also State, DOE, Treasury, etc.  The cabinet serves at the pleasure of the POTUS, and thus all people reporting to cabinet level officials also serve at the pleasure of the POTUS.  The POTUS wields this enormous power because in this day and age we possess a permanent standing army, by far the most powerful standing army in the world.

[As Lincoln put it when he exercised the suspension clause:](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0029.205/--lincoln-s-suspension-of-the-writ-of-habeas-corpus?rgn=main;view=fulltext) ""Now it is insisted that Congress, and not the Executive, is vested with this power. But the Constitution itself, is silent as to which, or who, is to exercise the power; and as the provision was plainly made for a dangerous emergency, it cannot be believed the framers of the instrument intended, that, in every case, the danger should run its course, until Congress could be called together; the very assembling of which might be prevented ... "", the idea here is that the very nature of the executive is to make fiat decisions when the situation demands it, i.e. during an emergency in which the deliberative nature of Congress becomes impractical.  That we have a standing army now,[ something the founding fathers explicitly stated would lead to a tyranny by the executive](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2013/07/why-founding-fathers-would-object-todays-military/66668/), means that such dangers that would require a powerful executive exist every second of every minute of every day.  This would require subsuming the national security apparatus, of which the intelligence community is but a small part, to the ""whims"" of the POTUS.  This makes selecting a good POTUS, one that is well versed in the awesome responsibilities s/he is called to hold, an incredibly important task, one that in this day and age may or may not lead to Armageddon.

---

>Preventing the Abuse of Intelligence for Partisan Purposes

I'm of the opinion that this is simply not possible, that given the arguments I've laid out above, the POTUS is tasked with doing whatever s/he deems prudent with the intelligence community.  [Quoting Federalist 41, once the necessity of a standing army became a permanent fixture, any semblance of the freedoms and liberties this country was ostensibly founded upon slowly but surely disappear:](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed41.asp)

>>> The veteran legions of Rome were an overmatch for the undisciplined valor of all other nations and rendered her the mistress of the world. Not the less true is it, that the liberties of Rome proved the final victim to her military triumphs; and that the liberties of Europe, as far as they ever existed, have, with few exceptions, been the price of her military establishments. ***A standing force, therefore, is a dangerous, at the same time that it may be a necessary, provision. On the smallest scale it has its inconveniences.  On an extensive scale its consequences may be fatal.*** On any scale it is an object of laudable circumspection and precaution.

The best solution to this particular problem would be to gut the standing army if at all possible.  I'm of the opinion that such a move is not prudent, and thus in all likelihood our freedoms and liberties will (continue to) erode.

This is best seen leading up to Jan 6th.  [That the military was relevant at all](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/03/politics/trump-election-defense-secretaries-public-letter/index.html) is a sign that if the military wanted to, it could have picked a side...and who or what could stand up to the US military if it came to a fight?

All it takes for the US to descend into authoritarianism and some version of martial law at this point is an executive with 1) the will to power, and 2) the ability to bend the US military to his/her will.  Someone like Trump certainly has the former, but clearly does not have the latter...at least not yet.  Because the military serves at the pleasure of the POTUS, [top officials like Mark Milley, when designing a counter to what he called a ""Reichstag moment"", believed the only choice the military had at that point to object was mass resignations.](https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/14/politics/donald-trump-election-coup-new-book-excerpt/index.html)  You can then game this out...an executive with this will to power could then just continue to fire/force resignations from top military officials until he got to one loyal to him.  After all, [this was one of the first steps Trump did after the 2020 elections](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/09/933105262/trump-terminates-secretary-of-defense-mark-esper) in what is seen now as [an attempt at a coup by Trump](https://www.cato.org/commentary/yes-it-was-attempted-coup).

---

>He also suggests to “fire or refer for prosecution” employees who are even suspecting of leaking information. While I agree that leaks in the intelligence community are a serious matter, that seems a bit of an extreme measure (as opposed to, say, putting restrictions on the employee while conducting an investigation).

[People have been executed for violating the Espionage Act](https://www.newsweek.com/espionage-act-violators-have-been-sentenced-decades-jail-execution-1733386), which is more or less akin to treason.  A simple firing is tame by comparison.

[Just think about how vulnerable the US would be if our nuclear submarine capability \\(a closely held secret\\) were exposed.](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3786326/us-needs-sea-based-nuclear-capability-to-ensure-second-strike-capability/)  We would lose our second strike capability, rendering our nuclear deterrent useless.  An adversary like Russia could threaten nuclear annihilation, and we would be powerless to protect ourselves from it, other than to launch a surprise initial nuclear strike, which if Russia still possessed its second strike capability, would lead to Armageddon and mutually assured destruction.

We would lose the strategic level of warfare (i.e. nukes) and in all likelihood would lose our mantle as a superpower.  Such is the power of secrets.  All of this is within the commander in chief's purview to shape, design, and execute, with Congress left only with the power of the purse to say otherwise...and this assuming a militarized executive would even bother to care about what Congress had to say.

---

edit - just to be clear here, whenever I talk about a ""standing army"", the intelligence community is assumed to be a small part of it, thus all arguments related to a standing army also apply to the intelligence community.  Much of the intelligence community carries out functions once explicit to the military, for example reconnaissance.  [Most modern reconnaissance is now performed by the NSA (the NRO provides the hardware).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Reconnaissance_Office)",r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPVXVqcE5XZjJuRnI2RjRhMDdDaHZMdGpVQnQ2b0hjNXMzWm9iYmxjblhiclVwV3lDdTRXLXhOeUhubjVtWHpSNzNkTXhTc3JJdXBuWVpHMG9MN3Z6VFE9PQ==
"> He also suggests to “fire or refer for prosecution” employees who are even suspecting of leaking information.

I just wanted to address this one statement in some detail.  I'm of the opinion that most people have no idea how strict the rules are when it comes to handling intelligence.

First some background...gonna [talk about SCIFs,](https://news.clearancejobs.com/2018/04/15/accidental-security-violation-wearing-apple-watch-scif/) which typically require a [TS/SCI clearance to access.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/4-types-us-govt-security-clearances-marsh-sutherland/)  SCIFs are extremely sensitive facilities with strict rules as to what you can bring into it without losing your security clearance.  Keep in mind that losing your clearance is synonymous with losing your job and getting fired in the field of intelligence.  

In the article about SCIFs, they discuss the prohibition on bringing a smart phone into the facility:

>>>Inadvertently bringing a cellphone into a SCIF is by far the most common violation. It’s a violation because we’ve long known that foreign intelligence services can remotely turn a target’s cell phone into a covert listening device – even when the phone is not in use.

This is more than enough to compromise the facility.  Anyone bringing in a smart phone into a SCIF is already, as you put it, ""suspect[ed] of leaking information""...the only thing that is not demonstrated is the intent to do so, and when it comes to this level of security, intent matters a lot less than determining whether or not you are practicing appropriate operational security (OPSEC), which is part of any intelligence agent's job description.  If you are lax in OPSEC, it will be a matter of time before you lose your clearance and are thus fired from your job.  The intent or lack thereof to leak information becomes wholly irrelevant.  Keep in mind that even a janitor mopping floors in a SCIF needs the proper level of security clearance to enter the facility.

A lot of people believe that because it deals with ""intelligence"", this particular field shares a lot in common with academia, because it's also full of smart people.  People do not understand that unlike academia, which is all about revealing information in order to advance understanding, intelligence works on a very different set of assumptions, and that deceit and obfuscation are the main tools of the trade.  Terms like [""plausible deniability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability)"" and [""compartmentalization""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmentalization_\\(information_security\\)) are routine in intelligence, whereas in academia anyone practicing such tools would be laughed out of the building.  The methodology is very different and requires a very different way of thinking about the value of information.

If you want to see an example as to how intelligence and academia can clash, sometimes severely, you can watch the [movie Oppenheimer.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppenheimer_\\(film\\))..almost the entire movie is a security clearance interview, and due to the sensitive nature of the evidence, a public trial is simply not an option, i.e. the (movie) public is more or less kept in the dark about what is going on.  In the movie, even Oppenheimer and the counsel he held on retainer are kept in the dark about information pertinent to himself and his clearance.  The movie depicts a conflict between the military and the academic community they sought out to build the atom bomb, and how that conflict centered around compartmentalization.",r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPWFk3ZmVjSjZsRDJkaU1DNWE5d1JkMHhuZ0p3LWxnNG1YUkJjalplbHJBamNCTmFRTElhNXFHbGtxV25HM21VdF9oSVZ2YXhCNzdDbnE2OS1vWFlDN2c9PQ==

I recommend replacing ""congressional"" with ""Senate"" or ""senatorial."" House elections are by district, where the partisan lean is often so strong that whoever wins the primary from the dominant party is practically guaranteed to win the general, so including those results would skew the answers to the question you're asking.

"OK, great. Let's go through it...

Per Rules A & B, we require a specific political question and the post must be framed in a neutral way. ""Can someone please explain..."" doesn't quite qualify, but something like this would:

> What are the pros and cons of the current impeachment process in the United States?

Then, per Rules C & D, the post itself would need some background and a source explaining the impeachment process and how it works. When reading that source, you'll find that impeachment and conviction are two separate things. 

So, the text of the submission could be something like this:

> The impeachment process in the United States involves the House of Representatives impeaching a Federal office holder, and then the Senate deciding whether or not to convict them. If convicted, the Senate also decides whether to remove them from office and, separately, whether they should be barred from seeking office in the future. [link to a source that explains this whole process]

> Donald Trump was impeached twice, but not convicted by the Senate either time, and is now running for President again. [link to source]

> What are the pros and cons of an impeachment process that can present significant facts against a person, but where the bar to conviction is high enough that they can retain/regain their office? Is this system working the way the framers of the Constitution intended it to? Under the current system of impeachment, are there sufficient checks on individual power to prevent bad actors from taking office?

Something like that would work. If you have any comments or questions, just reply here, and thanks in advance for engaging in the process.",r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPZkF1VDNKU0doTnRpU2h1VFJvTmZ4WVZjalFQMzM0ZlBxeXFZUGtIcnJ4VkZ3TlZOUmp6SXREaXZTQUlTQTN1V1M0Tm9JYTZSQXlWa1gyR3ZKejVhZ1E9PQ==

"> mainstream right wing

This is almost an oxymoron. The fact that it's a political ""wing"" usually means it's outside of, or on the edge of, the mainstream views of that faction.

From the [Cambridge Dictionary:](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/wing)

> **wing** *noun* [C] (POLITICAL GROUP)
>
> **a group within a political party or organization whose beliefs are in some way different from those of the main group:**
> 
> **left wing** *The president is on the left wing of the Democratic party.*

The terms ""right wing"" and ""far right"" are the same to most of us, because ""wing"" refers to the outside edge of something.

"The American Union is proposing military downsizing as part of its three planks for 2024: end poverty, end mass incarceration, end the endless wars. (The American Union is a union of swing voters looking to bargain nationwide for pre-election passage of crowdsourced legislation in exchange for the winning bloc of votes.) You can read a summary of the 101 policies [on their website](https://anamericanunion.com/trump-biden-peace-plan/) and download the text of the legislation \\[[310-page PDF](https://anamericanunion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Trump-Biden-Peace-Plan-2.pdf)\\]. Title III has a couple parts.

Since the United States military is the 800-pound gorilla on the planet, leading by example includes downsizing: four years of 10% cuts to the military budget  (which is up over 40% since Trump took office), closing some of our 750+ foreign military bases, and repealing the 2001/2002 AUMFs that serve as a blank check for our Middle East militarism. Additionally, there would be a directed effort to bring an end to the Korean War.

Then there's the arms race. The US is exacerbating it by upgrading our ICBMs: that would be paused, and the overall nuclear stockpile would be reduced by half over five years. Still plenty of weapons to crispify the planet, but reducing the need for other countries like China to keep up. Also, the US would adopt a ""no-first use"" nuclear policy, and the development or acquisition of ""killer robots"" (lethal autonomous weapons) would be prohibited.

To help improve our moral standing on the world stage, the use of unilateral economic sanctions against civilian populations (with exceptions for wartime) would be ended, the military prison at Gitmo would close, and the US would phase out landmines in five years. And to make global sales of our munitions less appealing, an 12% export tax is applied.

Foreign policy is a nuanced thing to address with legislation, but that's what a union of swing voters can bargain for. The United States can be the calmer heads on the planet. As to how to better use these resources, the first plank, end poverty, is accomplished through unconditional basic income. If you're serious about cutting the military budget, you've got to recognize that many rural areas depend on military spending in their local economy and replace that with something else. UBI will free people up to do more productive things and create other economic opportunities besides joining the military.",r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQVThUbTVvVFFidGVUeWkySXpmZnctc3pscTZTZnN4TmdUSTQyT1JpcU93UVFNTDBXMGk2YkczZm91WGk3UzlWeGFsdkh6N2xlbGdfOVl2a1M3TWtxT0NLSnZaR25UdXdjbjJKQmcyblQxSUU9

"I look at this issue quite differently.

For many nations, if you want to have good schools, infrastructure, healthcare and education, you need *more* military spending, not less.

The prime example right now is Ukraine, whose citizens, infrastructure, healthcare, prosperity and future have all [suffered dramatically since 2022.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine)

They have an aggressive neighbor who, in 2008, threatened Ukraine and Georgia, and with the latter, used propaganda techniques to foment dissent and construct a [pretext for invasion.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Georgian_War) At the time, Ukraine's military budget was 2.3% of GDP. They should have recognized the threat and increased their military spending, but 2008 was the height of the financial crisis and it was difficult for governments everywhere to allocate any funds toward anything that didn't have an immediate impact on the welfare of their people, so in the years following, their military spending actually *decreased.*

But by 2013, Ukraine still hadn't raised their military spending. That's the year the country made overtures to the west and, in response, Putin directly threatened to invade two of their provinces. Still, they didn't emphasize military preparedness. They overthrew their leader for favoring Russia in 2014, but apparently thought there would be no military consequences.

Later that year, Putin [invaded Crimea and started a civil war in two provinces of Eastern Ukraine.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War) The Ukrainians weren't properly prepared to fight them off and their people suffered greatly.

Yet still, military spending only increased to 3.3% of GDP by 2015. That increase allowed them to hold the Russians in place, modernize some of their equipment, and train new forces, but not expel the invaders. Apparently content with that, by 2021, Ukrainian military spending was at 3.2% of GDP.

The Russians launched their full scale invasion early in the following year, which is what finally caused the Ukrainians to go onto a real war footing. But in the meantime, Russia, with a much larger population, has shifted to a complete [wartime economy.](https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-economy-world-bank-upgrade-high-income-country-war-sanctions-2024-7)

And look where all this has gotten the Ukrainian people. All the citizen-focused policy areas highlighted in this post — poverty, education, and healthcare — plus many more, are markedly worse for Ukrainians today. There's no guarantee that things would have gone better had they invested more in their military, but deterrence is definitely more cost-effective than war. Additionally, one of the primary drivers of Ukraine's economy these days is their [arms industry,](https://www.npr.org/2024/02/13/1229974838/ukraine-weapons-industry-russia-war) which is putting a lot of food on the table in a lot of households there, and will likely be a major sector of their export economy if they survive the war.

In short, the world is a dangerous place. Countries that don't protect themselves are at risk from bad actors who can take advantage of their vulnerability and dramatically worsen life for their people. Maintaining a strong military and credible deterrent is an essential component of protecting the citizens from that potential outcome.",r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQUlgtTk9sQTJNd2duRndFbHpzREI2RGRWbzI0cm1DUkJPM3Y2czJpX21xLUtzWWFGSDA1SnhBa0xzeUg1S0tudVNfeGV1d1A1ZjhmXzJwTU1KV0llaGc9PQ==

"IMHO the best way to look at this issue is structurally, and to focus on two words: security competition.  Unlike in the corporate setting, where competition is encouraged and monopoly discouraged, in the realm of security, competition equates to people and nations killing each other in order to feel secure.  The main driver of this state of affairs is what's called the [security dilemma](https://www.britannica.com/topic/security-dilemma), i.e. as nations spend more to defend themselves, they actually become less safe, as detailed below.

In the corporate setting, a dominant market share makes a company feel ""safe"" from bankruptcy, and similarly in the security setting, a dominant position of power will render a nation ""safe"" from annihilation.  In the corporate setting, competition is encouraged, because the customer, i.e. all the people, actually benefit from lower prices and better products when corporations compete.  In the security setting however, all competition does is destroy cities and forces nations to commit mass murder, and so it is highly discouraged.

This issue sadly is structural, i.e. it's less about whether or not you can just devise some strategy to mitigate security competition...rather you need to see how much competition is out there, the more competitors leading to more militarization.  During the [unipolar moment](https://www.newsweek.com/end-unipolar-moment-opinion-1687036), military spending was low throughout the world,[ particularly in the United States](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.CD?locations=US) (note military spending actually decreased from 1990 to 2000.)  This of course makes sense...as no one could challenge the US, no one, including the US, needed to spend as much on security.

As the Newsweek article points out, the unipolar moment has ended, and security competition between multiple great powers is the norm going forward.  This equates to increased military expenditure by all great powers as they all fear annihilation by a prepared adversary.  As they increase spending on the military, this alarms their competitors, which in turn also increase military spending, i.e. an arms race develops.  Until a clearly dominant party emerges, all parties become less safe as a result.

This is clearest in regions where security competition is acute, i.e. places like the Korean peninsula and Israel.  [Both South Korea and Israel have a mandatory conscription policy](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/countries-with-mandatory-military-service), such is their need for military spending.

So, the TLDR answer to your OP question is that the demilitarization you are looking for now actually occurred 30 years ago during the unipolar moment.  We are now in the opposite environment, and so an arms race is in all likelihood inevitable.",r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNRT092bTJCSHUycHB1MzdoWXZUSWNJNjI3YTBBdU5FVFhlZ3cycWtEejBOcGl6RjFibUdLbWtEVjhac0J4ZEIxY1F0ODhTWG1oRkpjMndFX0hsNW5sY3c9PQ==

"IMHO the US is an empire. [ This state of affairs became manifest shortly after the end of the Cold War.](https://www.mearsheimer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Imperial-by-Design.pdf)  

Given the above, America's borders are then no longer defined by the 50 states but rather by where its armies are located, and [they are everywhere.](https://ubique.americangeo.org/map-of-the-week/map-of-the-week-u-s-military-bases-around-the-world/)  We treat an attack on any country that hosts a US military base as an attack against the US alliance structure, with concomitant risks to the integrity of the empire if we are perceived to not be willing to defend our allies.

Because of this forward deployed military presence, IMHO the question isn't to ask who is threatening us, but rather who are we threatening, and [countries like Russia for decades have been signaling that they view NATO as an existential threat](https://www.cairn.info/revue-politique-etrangere-2009-5-page-107.htm), and thus we now see the Russian response, deny Ukraine entry into NATO at all costs.

The plethora of articles you'll see suggesting that NATO is not a threat to Russia defy simple logic.  [The security dilemma](https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100451770) flatly implies that any defensive alliance has an offensive, and thus threatening, component.

"In the case of NATO, the alliance is more relevant now than it has been in decades as the war in Ukraine continues. NATO plays a role in distributing military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, and the alliance will be influential in the outcome of the war.

"This is a great post, so I appreciate it! From my experience, PACs seem to be created exclusively for obscuring individual's and their influence (money). I'd be curious to one day read over the legal aspects of PACs, too.  

I've been personally building some resource lists, but hadn't jumped into PAC money flow. My focus was on general reliable news sources. The problems (and their reasons) with American politics are many and complex, but PACs are a sizeable segment of it. I had a few notes on PACs, but they were more concerned with investigative reporting generally and not on money sources.  I hope these spark an idea in you that builds on your current knowledge!

Here's a few things I've learned (my background is in investigations, intelligence collection, military, and politics):

* Even if you can't see the whole trail, every connection you uncover can help you connect the dots. Board members, what other organizations these people work/contribute to.
* Pay attention to the messaging these PACs push. Who benefits from the policies they're advocating for? Who tends to lend support.  
* Don't just rely on the big news outlets. Look for investigative journalism, smaller watchdog groups, and even social media (with a healthy dose of skepticism, of course).  When it comes to these outlets, I can often find valid data and cited references in the more slanted websites/organizations, but it gets ""quarantined"" until I corroborate it.  

I know this isn't the most helpful comment as far as resources go, but I hope it's encouraging!",r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYb2xxLVVJMm9JdG5xeUZzdFVKc0tJaGliRjVwRWlKeW4zQVRrb2hxZzRuZHljTTRxeFRmR2IwZUFUcnkzOVV1SzRwU1NpOVFNMEJHZ0tJMDYxTHdqTVE9PQ==

"Is it that the PACs are listed, but don't disclose all their funding, or is it that some of the PACs are not listed at all?

I ask because there are many different kinds of PACs. The two main categories are [connected and non-connected.](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/registering-pac/understanding-nonconnected-pacs/) There are five different types of [non-connected PACs:](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/registering-pac/types-nonconnected-pacs/) Traditional, Leadership, Partnership, Super, and Hybrid. Then there's the SSF, which is often referred to as a PAC, but technically isn't.

Each one of these has different disclosure rules.

Simply put, not all PACs are required to disclose their funding sources.

">At what point are elections considered invalid due to widespread violence? How much violence would be necessary for this to occur?

Each state has its own election laws.  Generally, you would be able to contest the election results if the violence meant [""That eligible voters who attempted to vote in accordance with the laws of the state were denied their right to vote""](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=ELEC&sectionNum=16100.) and [""it appears that a sufficient number of voters were denied the right to vote as to change the result.""](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=ELEC&sectionNum=16204.)  So, for easy math, if you had 10,000 registered voters, 30% voter turnout with the ballots split 1600-1400, and an additional 300 people said they would have voted but violence kept them from the polls, then you could contest the election.

>Is there such a thing as an ""acceptable"" level of violence to keep election results valid? Does a state's status as a battleground state affect such a calculus?

What actually happens?  Is this a protest and a counter-protest battling in a park or in front of city hall?  Or is this a disruption at a polling place?  Harder to argue that political violence in a park stopped you from voting than some incident at a polling station.  Once more, when you count up the votes not made, are the enough that we would get a different result?  If you have 100,000 votes to 90,000 and an incident stopped 5,000 people from voting, the results of the election would not change and so there is no basis to contest it.

In addition, [California's Election law makes threats or use of violence against a voter to change their voting behavior a felony.](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=ELEC&sectionNum=18540.)  Other states likely do as well.

>Has anything like this ever happened, if not at the federal level, at the state and local level?

Sure, but in 2020 [""Election Day fears of voter intimidation largely didn’t come to pass"".](https://www.vox.com/2020/11/4/21549759/election-day-voter-intimidation-didnt-happen)  People's perception of risk formed from the national news tends to not map well on their local circumstances.

"Thanks for reading the rules and engaging in the process. You're not being disrespectful at all!

There's always a bit of interpretation involved, so let's go through the post and I'll explain what adjustments need to be made.

> would you like me to link a citable third-party article

Yes, that's part of it. Per Rule D: ""Submissions that do not include sources will be rejected."" Even just an article or study describing the test would be fine. You don't need to support its accuracy.

Please also provide a source to support the implied premise that such tests are not currently required. It's difficult to prove a negative, but with a quick search, I was able to find that [the US Office of Personnel Management includes one type of cognitive test in its hiring evaluations.](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/assessment-and-selection/other-assessment-methods/cognitive-ability-tests/) It's not clear when or for what positions it applies.

Along those lines, please tell the users what jurisdiction you're talking about. Many users will assume it's for the US Federal government, but this is an international forum and it may be that some other jurisdictions already employ such practices, either on the state level or in other countries.

Finally, per Rule B's requirement for neutral framing, we don't allow questions that only ask for responses from one side of an issue. So, an alternative way to frame the title question would be something like:

> What are the pros and cons of requiring cognitive tests for government positions?

And in the text:

> Would you prefer a more open-ended question such as ""What would be the benefits and drawbacks of providing/requiring a test such as the MOCA before an individual is elected or given security clearance?""

Yes, exactly.

So, sources, neutrality, and a little more detail are what's needed. Overall, it's an interesting question and I expect it will generate some good discussion.

"Thanks for the perspective from California, that was an interesting read.

> in 2020 ""Election Day fears of voter intimidation largely didn’t come to pass"".

I don't think Vox is a credible source here.  [They are citing themselves as evidence](https://www.vox.com/21514657/poll-watchers-trump-army-voters) when it comes to voter intimidation, and they are citing poll watching, about which they clearly state ""This isn’t unique to the Trump campaign; the Biden campaign is also recruiting tens of thousands of poll observers.""  IMHO they were stoking irrational fear against the Trump campaign ahead of the actual election in 2020.

In 2020 there was a group called the [Transition Integrity Project](https://paxsims.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/preventing-a-disrupted-presidential-election-and-transition-8-3-20.pdf) which released a detailed report titled ""Preventing a Disrupted Presidential Election and Transition"", which IMHO is the gold standard when it comes to 2020 election prognostications.  They had gamed out four scenarios based upon the results of the election, and were largely if not eerily accurate in their prediction on how the Trump campaign would act that year (pg 6):

> * Calling for recounts in all states in which victory was not already apparent.

> * Launching coordinated investigations at the state and federal levels into alleged “voting irregularities” in an effort to undermine public confidence in results that did not go Trump’s way and/or
alter the results.

> *  Attempting to halt the counting of mail-in ballots by filing cases in state court or leaning on Republican leaders to stop vote counting or to certify a result early, without waiting for the certified
results from the Secretary of State.

> * Turning out their well-organized and committed base to take to the streets in Trump’s favor, in
part by disseminating disinformation about the danger posed by pro-Biden demonstrators (e.g., by
suggesting likely Antifa violence, etc.).

> * Relying on both FOX News and right-wing social media to echo and amplify pro-Trump messages and facilitate the harassment and bullying of election officials, to cause chaos and delay
and/or to intimidate officials into taking actions that benefited Team Trump.

> * Using federal agencies to justify or support Trump campaign tactics. In one of the more aggressive moves undertaken in one of the TIP exercises, Team Trump had Attorney General Bill Barr
order the seizure of mail-in ballots to ensure that vote counting would stop.

This reads like a history but is in fact a prediction published in August 2020, one that came to pass on every point.  As this forum requires sourcing for facts even if they seem obvious, I will source each point.  [The first three points are summarized here.](https://web.mit.edu/healthyelections/www/final-reports/recounts-election-contests.html)    The fourth point is [evident in the January 6th insurrection](https://www.cato.org/commentary/yes-it-was-attempted-coup).  For the fifth point, Tucker Carlson [""Doubles Down on 2020 Election Fraud Claims""](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2023/03/07/tucker-carlson-doubles-down-on-2020-election-fraud-claims-with-jan-6-footage-despite-fox-defamation-lawsuit/).  Carlson before he was fired from Fox was the [""most-watched cable TV personality""](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/oct/31/tucker-carlson-fox-news-book-brian-stelter) in America.  For the sixth point, while Barr didn't order seizures of mail in ballots, he did sow [""distrust about the risks of widespread voter fraud""](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2023/03/07/tucker-carlson-doubles-down-on-2020-election-fraud-claims-with-jan-6-footage-despite-fox-defamation-lawsuit/) utilizing his office and position as attorney general.

***What is notable from the above is what is absent***, i.e. exactly what the OP post is about, disruptive violence on Election Day.  In fact, searching the document for the words ""violent"" or ""violence"" returns exactly zero hits.  Violence of any sort was not on the TIP's radar in 2020.  It is however on the DHS's radar this year (sourced in OP), which I also consider to be a credible source for these kind of prognostications.

"What does [the DHS report (p. 19) say about violence this year:](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2023-09/23_0913_ia_23-333-ia_u_homeland-threat-assessment-2024_508C_V6_13Sep23.pdf)

>Some DVEs [Domestic Violent Extremists], particularly those motivated by conspiracy theories and anti-government or partisan grievances, may seek to disrupt electoral processes. Violence or threats could be directed at government officials, voters, and elections‑related personnel and infrastructure, including polling places, ballot drop box locations, voter registration sites, campaign events, political party offices, and vote counting sites.

Evaluate those statements  from the perspective of one of the 150 million voters.  Sure, the large number of polling places, ballot drop box locations, and voter registration sites mean that one somewhere in the country will most likely experience disruption due to violence this year but it probably isn't going to be the one you use.  DHS isn't expressing concern about widespread, coordinated activity targeting polling stations across the country.  DHS' prediction is just that it could happen somewhere.  

>[As NPR's Domenico Montanaro has put it, ""just 44,000 votes in Georgia, Arizona and Wisconsin separated Biden and Trump from a tie in the Electoral College.""](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/02/940689086/narrow-wins-in-these-key-states-powered-biden-to-the-presidency)

According to the numbers on Politico's election tracker, Arizona was the narrowest with 1,672,143 votes for Biden and 1,661,686 for Trump.  [In 2004, the average voting precinct had about 1100 voters.](https://web.archive.org/web/20061214025307/http://www.eac.gov/election_survey_2004/chapter_table/Chapter13_Polling_Places.htm)  If you assume Arizona has voting districts with 1250 voters each, then you would have needed to completely shut down more than 10 which would mostly have voted for Biden to have made a difference in the election.  You would have had to have disrupted even more in Georgia and Wisconsin to flip the end result.  DHS is not predicting such widespread, coordinated violence.  

Even if it were, the link above noted that Arizona had 2,110 electoral precincts in 2004.  So, even a wide-spread coordinated attack on Arizona polling stations sufficient to affect the results would be a fraction of a percent of polling stations; the vast majority of voters would not be affected.  The risk from the individual voters perspective is minimal even if DHS has made a credible prediction.",r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNabjlyc2hDV1ZEN3hTQXl2dm93SG42ci1vdTJEaUl2b1FsMEhkRllWZUR5N1RuOGt1bFBzOE9NYWgzZVFZTUVGMHBOTDhZVHhrUzNreDVVU1lpVkVuelE9PQ==

**Title:**

How do we lessen political hostility when we're so polarized?

**Body:**

The United States has a [long history of political polarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_polarization_in_the_United_States#History) and the last few years have been [some of the most intense](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/s-s-driving-americas-increasing-political-polarization-rcna89559) in a while. Other countries are also divided, but [the pace of polarization has been especially fast in the US.](https://www.brown.edu/news/2020-01-21/polarization)

People don't just disagree; they [view members of the other party with suspicion](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/10/10/how-partisans-view-each-other/) and as [a threat,](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/us/democracy-gop-democrats-sectarianism.html) often leading to outright hostility.

Questions:

* In past times of political polarization, in the US or abroad, what policies have been successfully employed to reduce political hostility?

"You can integrate it, as long as you have evidentiary support and can keep it neutral.

Part of the polarization issue you're highlighting is that we allow our *own* side or our *own* media silo to define what the *opposition* stands for. It behooves propagandists in those polarized channels to portray the oppostion in the worst possible light and with a very broad brush. 

For example, people who are steeped deeply in right-wing media silos may believe liberals as a whole want to abort fetuses up to the day they're due, while people who inhabit the extreme left-wing media environment may believe conservatives as a whole want to ban birth control. That makes it hard for those people to have conversations. But these are actually really extremist positions on both sides and you'll find very few people identifying themselves as ""liberal"" or ""conservative"" who hold these views.

Just to play devil's advocate, the ""other side"" you're talking about here would argue they're protecting the *most* marginalized community: unborn children who don't have a voice and cannot stand up for themselves. The ""real consequences"" they face are certain death.

I'm not saying this is my view or should be yours, but if we want to look at the issue from a neutral perspective, we should at least consider the opposing point of view.

"Selective service and the draft are related but separate. Selective service essentially creates a list of individuals that _might_ be eligible for service should a draft be instated.

This essentially removes the possibility of [penalties](https://www.sss.gov/register/benefits-and-penalties/) although I'm not aware of this ever actually being enforced.

 It's much easier to morally justify a law about
 something that does not directly affect a group you belong to, because you yourself will not have to face any consequences. But in that same vain, being a part of the affected group can lead to irrational support or contempt that disuades conversation.

"Basically, a true democracy creates true diffusion of power; where **the people** together are in power; no single person holds any more power than another; no all-powerful president or congress people/parliamentarians etc. (even though ""leadership"" positions may exist) they are always, at all times, subject to the control of the people.

Now in such a system, already, competition for power is pretty much made useless.

You don't have elections where you have whole sale packages, choosing between two packages, party 1 and 2, wholesale, you vote for its good and bad. Because again, the goal is competition for power. No.

This time, no one comes with a long manifesto, and comes as a whole package. Issues are decided on an individual bases. So its now about competition of issues. When any issue is tabled before the ""parliamentary body"" it can come from anyone, any number of people. We compare and contrast the solutions proposed on each issue, and try to get the best one to  rise to the top. When that issue is done, next one is on its own.

That's the gist of it. I will conclude by defining politics (funny I put this at the conclusion). This is defined by an independent author (Fuseini Yakubu) in his new book ""The Tragedy Called Democracy in the 21st Century (2023)"" [See: https://tfog.org/books/the-tragedy-called-democracy/ ] hence the reason I said you wont find in common literature; I use these definitions because much of existing literature on these issues are flawed; inconsistent.

Now according to him: Politics is the way in which relationships with and between members of a community are formed, managed or exploited, to achieve set goals within or of that community.

Now when the goal of the activities described above is to win power for someone, that's power politics. When the goal or object of the activities above is to push for an issue, that results in issue politics. I'm simplifying it, and there may seem like there is an overlap, but I guarantee you, there isn't; it's always 1 or the other (and I don't mean there are only 2 forms of politics); one is always the primary goal, and another may feature as a secondary means to the primary, and the secondary may thus be manipulated. And no, identity politics is not among, it's not a ""form of politics"" that's an error in existing literature; it's classified as something else.

"When your population is as large and diverse as ours is, what tends to be the great unifier is a common enemy. Nationalism goes up typically in times of war (https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/bonikowski/files/bonikowski_and_dimaggio_-_varieties_of_american_popular_nationalism.pdf). It also tends to be linked greatly to a lack of experience with other cultures. Your way is always the best when you know of no other ways of being. In the modern day I feel like we have less and less Boogeyman to rally against outside of ourselves. A lot of the younger generation see the whitewashed history we were taught and find the obvious hypocrisies in it. As much as we get force-fed this idea of China or Russia being this threat to the democracy that we supposedly bring to the rest of the world, I think it's fairly simple to see that these hostilities only exist between certain classes in each of these societies and those classes need to rally popular support to further these purely selfish campaigns against each other, while the masses face continued stress on the home front just trying to get by. We can only get exploited for so long while being told it's for our own good.

"Someone also asked in another subreddit about the role of money in governance today (lamenting that only the rich can rise to power).

I explained to him as well (in a rather long response, how it all came to be) and that it boils down again to this competition for power. I will pick a quote from that response that is relevant to this:

""Now they all \\[the system and autocratic offices that we have created, viz. the presidency and congress\\] have to compete for power every 4 years. Note therefore that in comes, again, the role of money.

So the role of money is only there because the system, by design, creates a **competition for power** (just like with kings \\[who rose to power because of the wealth and strength, and subsequently passed it down by heredity\\], except \\[now in our modern system\\] this competition is repeated every 4 years, and they don't compete/fight with swords etc. but with lies, marketing, manipulation of the subjects, criminal/business deals with sponsors, etc. and of course, still, money; that is \\[power\\] politics).""

"This would just result in oligarchy.

If anyone can raise an issue, only the richest will be able to promote said issue to gain enough popular awareness and support to get it passed. Only the richest will be able to afford psychological profiling, media targeting, mass advertising, etc etc. Both to craft their desired policy in just the right language that is both broadly appealing And accomplishing their goal, and then to message that policy to the amenable masses.

And it would still devolve into political parties. They’ll just be paid by rich people, instead of by tax dollars.

Groups of the rich will find common ground on enough issues to hire permanent groups of “consultants” to do their message crafting, targeting, and messaging/ advertising. The consultants will be a combo of lawyers, marketers, data / tech people, and psych analysts.

Much like… a campaign team.

Different groups of rich people will coalesce around different platforms.

None of this will be some conspiracy, it’s just efficiency. Why would a rich person pay to spin up all that data and expertise for just One policy?

The result would be a dystopian nightmare, largely because instead of rich people having to fight for the attention and obedience of the power brokers… they just hire them directly.",r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnUDFaQ3FoVjJxLThZU3NnZjBZelBSd1pYNENSa0J0ZG5VdlZhU3ZOWDdaTkxHdkhZRlJFcGF4V1BfbWF0Y3N2UW1FOC1KQnhLMnVjbmFSaS15RGYyZlE9PQ==
"The only meaningful answer to this question is decentralization. Over the past few decades (the past century, really), the size and scope of the federal government has grown substantially ([source](https://mises.org/mises-wire/six-graphs-showing-just-how-much-government-has-grown)). A handful of people now have far more power over the economy and society, compared to 20, 50, 100 years ago. This is the source of the political polarization - politics has become a game of seizing the levers of power within the government in order to force the whole of society to conform to a one-size-fits-all partisan agenda.

Conservatives want to use governmental power to enforce religious/traditional family values, individual responsibility, lax gun laws, protectionist trade policy, hawkish foreign policy, etc. (source [1](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism), [2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Political_positions_of_the_Republican_Party_(United_States)&diffonly=true))

Liberals/progressives want to use governmental power to enforce wealth redistribution, the expansion of welfare/handouts, abortion, positive rights, restrictive gun laws, regulation of business, etc. ([source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_the_Democratic_Party_(United_States)))

These policies are often in direct conflict with each other, and many people view the imposition of certain policies as deeply immoral, destructive to the well-being of society, and even as an existential threat. Pundits and propagandists on both sides amplify and exaggerate these sentiments in order to incite an emotional response and garner support for their cause. The more support they garner, the more likely their candidate will seize the reigns of power and achieve their agenda.

Until you convince religious fundamentalist conservatives to accept abortion or progressive liberals to accept the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman, politics will be polarized, and people will be hostile. The only meaningful solution to lower the temperature is to set up a system in which different demographics or regions are allowed to live according to their own convictions, instead of attempting to impose a one-size-fits-all rule set upon the whole of society. That solution involves radical decentralization of political power. You can accept that, or you can put up with a hyper-polarized and hostile political environment for eternity. The choice is yours.",r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNndDE1aGxTX1dLSHNFdDFkZXFnajhLdThsVjBPVVFvM2RJTlNjOEtWbjZGWll3VmVGeHJZZ25udThFUEJISHo0cm5mM3BITGNaX2Jkd2JFNzZaTFR1ZTJPMDhwZk9aMHU4azM5M0YzZGtWaFE9

"Those assertions (pretty much conclusions) are the result of pages of analyses spanning several chapters of the book cited; covering and analysing the structure of mass political parties as organisations (drawing similarities between such parties and gangs in general), the history of parties, the structure of the proposed alternatives and how the proposed alternatives avoid devolving into similar party politics, through a wide range of institutional, electoral, and other matters, which all lead us to the conclusion stated.

Unfortunately no other author I have studied has explored the question as well, as coherently and with as much veracity as the source I have cited, which itself cites many sources for varying issues (which I cannot use because, alone, such sources do not repeat same analyses, but only back the former with relevant evidence) and I do not think I can find any source making the same analyses and thus drawing the same conclusions as the source I have cited.

I think your rules would thus greatly limit the education that your audience can access, for instance if the present body of [common] literature is flawed or inadequate for any reason; it assumes that every problem that will be presented here, is a common and exhausted problem; and does not make room for unique/challenging ones with few answers out there.

There are plenty of [countries with more centralized power than the US,](https://www.federalismindex.org/centralizationcountrycomparison) but [less polarization,](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-political-polarization-rankings) so it's difficult to accept that the ""only meaningful answer"" to the problem of polarization is decentralization.

It's also not clear that greater Federal revenues or expenditures are even correlated with polarization. As OECD nations go, [the US is comparatively low in taxation](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-do-us-taxes-compare-internationally) — below average as a share of GDP and about average in per capita revenue.

">...ways to encourage a polarized population to engage in meaningful, polite, civil discussions?

Honestly? You're not going to be able to do that.   
Full stop.

**People who you might want to sway and encourage polite discourse have no want to engage in that sort of conversation.** They want emotional, click-bait, rage-inducing topics. They operate on an *emotional* level, not a mental one. Most of it typically pulls back to a single source, which they will not budge on, regardless of well placed ideas/words and factual evidence.

\\-=-

I've gone back and forth with a llama-3 model ([specifically this one](https://huggingface.co/failspy/Llama-3-8B-Instruct-abliterated-GGUF)) on this topic a number of times. The best thing we've come up with it dubbed ""Cultural Sabotage"" or a ""Cultural Virus"". Working from the inside to slowly subvert stereotypes/expectations/preconceptions/etc.

Granted, there isn't a straight forward way of doing this (which would make sense, given the idea itself). **The main goal is to plant seeds of doubt in the mental states of people like this, breaking them outside of their built-in notions and forcing them to view their ideas objectively.** 

*But, subtly.*   
Not by directly targeting/attacking their beliefs, *because that's ultimately what they get off on in the first place*. 

**It's tricky on how to go about this.**

\\-=-

Memes are one method, but it's easy to misinterpret them (possibly reinforcing their ideas). 

It suggested ""echoing"" as well, repeating dominant narratives with a subtle twist, to ""create a sense of familiarity and discomfort"". 

""Cognitive dissonance induction"" is another suggestion, which is [backed by a paper](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/spc3.12715), oddly enough. I do not know enough to speak on it though.

You could go for the emotional approach as well (since that's technically what they want anyways). Somehow tie your message (which is to break preconceptions and old thought patterns to allow for critical thinking) to a ""heavy"" emotion. It would worm its way in their brain and *hopefully* do the job.

\\-=-

At the end of the day, you're trying to get someone (who has no want to think) to objectively view their thoughts and readjust them based on new information. 

**You can't do it directly, I promise.**  
**You have to create a ""brain worm"", in a sense, and let them reprogram themselves.**

Unlike many other subreddits and most sites on the internet, this forum has a long history, and in fact, a founding principle, that all factual claims must be associated with a linked source. It's what the subscribers here expect from each other and the moderators.

That being said, it doesn't mean we can't introduce each other to new perspectives. 
A great way to do that is to write something along the lines of: ""So-and-so has a great book called *X* on this topic, and although I can't link the whole thing, here are a couple papers he has written (or articles he has published or an in-depth review of the book in a respected journal).""

"lol people assume so much. You think by seating I mean where individual members/parties sit? I mean no disrespect by the lol, don't get me wrong.

To understand these things, there are a complex web of issues you need to understand to have context. For instance I would say, that the speaker of the house should not be the speaker. To understand why we need to go into the history of the Speaker's position in England

You don't need an upper and lower house; that is also a poorly copied work from England, which had its reason for having those; it wasn't due to intelligent design, but circumstance.

Now all that said, the ""senators"" should rather be ""speakers."" To understand that I need to explain the grave vocabulary errors that scholars, from the time of Madison, to Joseph Schumpeter of more recent times, have made with the simple word ""representatives."" We don't even have the right understanding of that word. Our ""representatives"" don't actually act as representatives. But it proposes that they now become ""speakers.""

What you call the speaker should now be the president, as it was in the beginning.

Now when it comes to seating, there should be no president (or chairperson) at the head, with everyone facing him. That, it is also argued, is an arrangement from old England, which had its seating inspired by the chapel it initially used for House sessions.  
  
The arrangement should more resemble that of a lecture hall. There are reasons for all these that relate to the changed functions of all government officials, that is proposed to be able to realize true democracy, there are changes to how debates need to be conducted, and like I said, everything you know about parliament/congress changes. So am not just talking about which side a party sits. In fact there can be no political parties as we know it in a true democracy.

These all raise huge questions, attempting to answer them satisfactorily would require pages of analyses, history etc.

My source is: The Tragedy Called Democracy in the 21st Century (2023) [https://tfog.org/books/the-tragedy-called-democracy/](https://tfog.org/books/the-tragedy-called-democracy/) the author goes great lengths to explain these details and offer further sources.

"Thank you for restoring my comment. 

The countries that are more centralized (but less polarized) than the US almost always have [lower ethnic, linguistic, and/or religious fractionalization](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/most-diverse-countries) compared to the US. The higher degree of cultural homogeneity in these countries allows them to be more centralized without causing as much tension because there are fewer cultural factions vying for power, and more agreement on the proper path for their country. 

This actually somewhat supports my point - decentralization would allow for various regions/demographics (which have a lower degree of fractionalization) to govern themselves in the way that they see fit. In many cases, this would likely take the form of a high degree of centralization of power within their region/demographic. The higher degree of cultural homogeneity within the region/demographic would help prevent hostility and polarization.

Edit: the [population of countries in Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_countries_by_population) are relatively on par with the [population of states in the US](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population), with a few exceptions.

I will try to answer your first comment

""If anyone can raise an issue, only the richest will be able to promote said issue to gain enough popular awareness and support to get it passed. Only the richest will be able to afford psychological profiling, media targeting, mass advertising, etc etc. Both to craft their desired policy in just the right language that is both broadly appealing And accomplishing their goal, and then to message that policy to the amenable masses.""

The proposed system for true democracy provides that the ""parliamentary body"" (let's call that the Assembly) receives motions through various sources: citizens can channel them through their representatives (and which representatives are bound by law to respond their constituents), or individually, as groups, etc. The secretariat of the Assembly is responsible to coordinating motions such that the various parties to issues are able to harmonize their arguments where there are similarities etc.

Now the important thing is that when it comes to debates, debates are not handled by the ""representatives"" in the Assembly; the issues are debated by the parties to that issue, its promoters. Everyone has a hearing therefore at this Assembly, and the debates at the assembly are not via long presentations like many such parliaments have today. It is in a more structured format much like we see in courts.

The Assembly is where you win votes, and argue your case, not with ad campaigns, your ads can be ripped apart as propaganda if it is, at the debates.

In any case, because in this environment, the prevailing system would be issue politics, it creates difficulties for people to invest in growing mass parties, it will invariably become a costly and wasteful expense, that is besides the fact that laws will also be used to prevent the development of mass parties as we know it. Parties may still exist, but not the kinds we know today.

So this is the new centralization of power. Your issue gets watered down or changed or “combined” with the rich lobbyist issue.

If 8,000 people all submit some variation of what the secretariat seems “the same issue”, you’re going to have 8,000 people all get to speak and debate on C span?

"I take that point, but in order for it to hold, we'd have to demonstrate that the polarization in the US is at least correlated with ethnic, linguistic and/or religious fractionalization, and better yet, caused by it.

From what I can tell, for the broadest demographics, the biggest political divide in the US is actually based on [geography](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00027162211070061) (urban/rural), not ethnicity, language or religion.

"It should be self-evident that a two-party system would be more polarized than a multi-party system. As we are seeing in this current election cycle, the Democratic pitch for Biden as president is partially simply that he's not Trump. (Though I would argue he's genuinely better than any Republican candidate they could have offered.) If there were more than two choices, such a strategy wouldn't be as useful. ([Source for this concept.](https://protectdemocracy.org/work/proportional-representation-and-polarization/))

So how does one introduce more parties into the American democracy? We have to change the voting and representation systems. The voting system must satisfy the [sincere favorite criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_favorite_betrayal_criterion) so that voters can always give their favorite maximum support. I prefer [Approval Voting](https://electionscience.org/library/approval-voting/) for many reasons, but there are other choices. The representation system must use [proportional representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation?wprov=sfla1) wherever possible. A natural progression for single-winner approval is to use [Sequential Proportional Approval Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_proportional_approval_voting) for proportional voting and selection.

This kind of change is slow, but so is all meaningful change. The landmark events you see in the headlines were preceded by *years* of organized work by dedicated people. With this kind of change, you're taking power away from entrenched parties, so there will be opposition.

Ok this is super random, but the world is so disjointed and seems to forget about facts if its not in a pretty picture right?….

So my thought was (something like this may already exist, if so chat feel free to roast and supply link pls thx) , “i just want to get like every single final vote tally (like at the end of those super boring hearings) and screenshot, and caption for rulings that hurt everyday people the most. Print them out. And when anybody asks about my thoughts i can just prove or disprove them without even speaking.” 
But i dont know where to find this cataloged. 

I dont care about sides. I do care about facts. Voting records are just factual things to help people know the reality in which their politicians behave, and they can vote according to their own beliefs (just unfortunately the fairness doctrine was axed and that made it legal for the news to lie to us). So things still relevant today like raising the minimum wage, im sure there were 5 different times its gone to the floor where its like all 200 r “nays” and even like 50ish d “nays” for all 5 times its gone to vote. Or like depending on how far the videos go back, the ruling that made corporations people, the ruling that made money into speech thats like 1978ish right? Maybe, if not on video, just finding any reference that can be photoed and all filed together? Like if someone made that into an instagram page it could be rad!

Ideally records go far enough back that we could show the stark comparison of corruption before/after PAC money became legalized! 
That could even show when bribery became unrecognized by the government.
Idk, would that then mean at that point, we would need corresponding data on how much PAC money each congress person?

Or even better, those could be like individual congress person baseball cards! Has the persons name, then per year and corresponding information on how much dark money/PAC money they took, in the  little stat number recangle graph, Rookie year, Retirement years, sidenotes can just have scandals.
Like a batting avg, but its a corruption avg lol, have an avg per year. Finally an all time avg. Little ⭐️ to indicate if there were years the politician didnt take bribes (PAC money).
Holographic if they never took pac money!! 

Sorry i lost the plot, but yeah, basically just looking for hella screenshots so i can show people and be like “here’s the numbers, you think this side did it, well here’s your guys doing exactly what you dont like. Or even if you like the side “is this an issue they usually side with, if not and they randomly voted terribly…was it moneyed influences?” Bc a lot of people will literally never see who blocked it while both sides claim to be good guys (or take credit for good things when they vote the opposite like mtayg does) 

But yeah literally just screenshot + the judgement it was about by name. Preferably with breakdowns of judgement too

Hopefully this hasnt been asked many times lol.",r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNna09aMldpb0J6Nm0zMllKR2IwM0RqZVRmUFJxTkdxX3ZjMGxqTDZKM1Bjc3NGWlhkSXZ2SVlkcThhV0lqVzRpb3hJeVhyM2p3TV9SMkowbU9Ua0RUeHc9PQ==
"Blaming ""the other side"" without acknowledging any faults from ""their own side"" is probably not the best approach to reduce polarization which is what OP was asking about. As an outside observer (european that don't get to vote on any of this) I'm seeing plenty of wrongs being done by people from both sides. The rhetoric in american politics is off the rails and you are trying to demonize and label each other even in the NEUTRAL politics forum.

I don't envy your options in this election and I don't know how to fix it but I suppose it could have been better if there were more than two parties, then you could have middle ground parties to vote for if the extremes are too far away from what you like.",r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnX0tzRnZydkljYm9IVW55VmpKQ2RwbU1COXlLTXJsV0FQLS12X1N2c1JvSXJCSUQ0TnRWYjBqNW43WXBxZU41aXEzbmwwTHZVVC1qc0diY0sxYXhsVGc9PQ==

"I mean, what they are saying about Republicans is not untrue, not in the slightest. There’s no demonizing going on there, it’s just the facts.

That said, and I realize the contradiction here, I don’t think it’s constructive to keep making that point. The problem is, there’s hawk/dove game theory going on here. Republicans always make the hawk play. There is no way to depolarize solely through being the adult in the room. So it’s both not productive to point out what Republicans are doing rhetorically, and also not productive to seek common ground, because Republicans will always exploit any openings. Democrats are perpetually stuck between taking the high road and, letting the right do what it wants, and taking the low road and giving the right fodder for their propaganda machine.

Again, I’m not blaming anyone here, that’s just the power dynamic that has developed. That’s just how it works.",r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnVVh0a2M4MmtWYnF4RXFWNUFxWlM0S2t6SUJpTUxWZzVCSTlOcW95a3JMSkVTamZrVS1sdWRHY0VvOE04VEhtaWYtTUQ1M2lrcWl4cEdOZDZXZlNfLWc9PQ==
"A few quotes from the [Pew Research article](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/changing-partisan-coalitions-in-a-politically-divided-nation/) that you linked:

>For decades, gender, race and ethnicity, and religious affiliation have been important dividing lines in politics. This continues to be the case today.  
...

>Republicans and Democrats do not just hold different beliefs and opinions about major issues, they are much more different racially, ethnically, geographically and in educational attainment than they used to be  
...

>As has long been the case, White voters are much more likely than those in other racial and ethnic groups to associate with the Republican Party. Hispanic and Asian voters tilt more Democratic. Black voters remain overwhelmingly Democratic.  
...

>The relationship between partisanship and voters’ religious affiliation continues to be strong – especially when it comes to whether they belong to any organized religion at all.

>The gap between voters who identify with an organized religion and those who do not has grown much wider in recent years.

Here's an excerpt from a [Foreign Affairs article](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2019-09-25/how-americans-were-driven-extremes) about polarization in the US:

>polarization in the United States is especially multifaceted. In most cases, polarization grows out of one primary identity division—usually either ethnic, religious, or ideological. In Kenya, for instance, polarization feeds off fierce competition between ethnic groups. In India, it reflects the divide between secular and Hindu nationalist visions of the country. But in the United States, all three kinds of division are involved.

>The clash that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s between progressive and conservative worldviews had a strong ideological component—especially when compared to the era of “consensus politics” that came immediately before. That said, race was and continues to be a major fault line—one that cannot, and should not, be ignored. And religion matters too: movements in the 1960s and 1970s to legalize abortion, to increase access to birth control, and to ban state-sponsored prayer in public schools brought religion directly into political debates and decisions.

>This powerful alignment of ideology, race, and religion with partisanship renders America’s divisions unusually encompassing and profound. It is hard to find another example of polarization in the world that fuses all three major types of identity divisions in a similar way.",r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNndmxEOXlId2ltMXIzb3U1TU1EZnlaWEZQem5DdVlqVUJhT3RKSmpsck1PY1FITVFES1MzRWxiakxuZTdxbnFOU0l2aVFDQldMVGFKdTAzVTcwYkphU2Z5cnFhbFk3MU9rdVV5cmE3UUYxVlk9
It starts with you. When the other guy shouts you have to take a step back and say sorry. And only your pride hurts.
