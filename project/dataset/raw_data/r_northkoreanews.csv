"At Thursday’s rally, Mun called on the assembled children to emulate the spirit of the Anti-Japanese Children’s Corps, a pre-independence youth group that inspired the formation of the KCU, and young troops during the Korean War.

To live up to these standards, he called on the children to boost Pyongyang’s ongoing efforts to advance its military capabilities by “actively supporting the Korean People’s Army and contributing to strengthening the nation’s military power by preparing more ‘Sonyon’ [‘Kid’] armed equipment,” referring to rocket launchers “donated” by the youth group last year.

"Interesting read. 

What I had not considered was the very real possibility that china would be willing to sacrifice North Korea for Taiwan. 

It is discussed in the article. China gives NK the green light to attack. They promise support. Perhaps they even give some. But they really don’t want NK to win. They want the US to be distracted, exhausted, isolated, and tied down in SK. 

That allows China to focus on Taiwan while NK takes the brunt of the US retaliation. Other than a buffer against SK, NK is nothing but a giant liability. So why not burn them for something better?",r/northkoreanews,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGWVRoYjV4a1NldVF6ZlUyTFJwNXNiMTQzOGNiUUNPcDUxcEQtdy11aDAtWl9SV3Q2LS1NUTNqTE9wVWVRLVU4RmlWT1owR2YwVFByV28ycUlid3VUYVE9PQ==

"> He singled out Ri Sun Chol, minister of state construction control who was appointed in September, as a ""good-for-nothing person"" who has never even been to the site since December, suspending him and calling for a formal investigation.

"As opposed to that tourism that aims for unfriendly foreigners that everyone else has /s, this just felt like a silly thing to make a whole headline about when it’s the goal of all tourism lol",r/northkoreanews,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaN3VmNDI0M0R0UDBUQ2ttdS1EMlpEYnFWR25OY0o0TWk3T1JRY2dsN1FjaFJXTjhyUFlaVzJuVVJzRm9ueE9zWjZxaFZMdF9jLUdpMlJPTHY4ZjJYTHc9PQ==
"They're trying to say that the ""friendly foreigners"" line is suggesting that they'll only allow foreigners from ""friendly"" countries (Russia, China). I feel like they might be reading a bit too deeply into it though, because they could just mean that they want foreigners who are friendly (which is how you interpreted it).",r/northkoreanews,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNkcxekZuN0NmNzVaa1VOT0FLanoyRS1Sek9JTWNKS0U0OUpDalVRMnRNZm1ocWhyeWxJbEdWWnloVi1nZ0I3cGhBajVRX0w5NlFZQ2g4R0ZLc0sxZHdzT0c2X2Vha1BBbXpQQWY2enZpUWs9
"For what seems like a long time ago many people from western countries were allowed in, and often people in the US were able to get in who were dual citizens with Canada using their Canadian passport. I remember the Vice guide to North Korea from long ago talking about how they got in by bribing the consulate in China and then had to attend some sort of dinner where they were told most of the people attending were actually North Koreans who were vetting them to see if they were cool or not.",r/northkoreanews,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhbHl5QnlJRmVfWFA0ZWZsQ2p5RUM4YWhkcE9VcnRBOW5ra0gzbU1pSVppSmxZZ1hsWWxMMTBWbE9vd2syY0ZzOXVBUDk3Q3BqUkc3VkFicDZ0YWFOSmc9PQ==
"I'm a US citizen and I was able to visit via a tour operator in China without bribing anyone or being made to attend a special dinner.

It took the NK consulate in Shenyang longer to approve my visa than it did the Europeans in my tour group, and I had to fly in rather than entering by train like the rest of the group, but that was the extent of the extra trouble I had to go to. I had a tour guide (or minder, if you prefer) all to myself because they had to have him meet me at the airport, but being able to have a bunch of one-on-one conversations with him turned out to be the best part of the trip.

That was in 2007, so I can't speak for how things are now, but it wasn't too far from the time of the Vice video. I don't think they lied about anything, per se, but my sense watching that video was that they were straining _really_ hard to present their packaged group tour like some kind of James Bond adventure.",r/northkoreanews,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhWTJjY2Nqa1h5a3NhcWRlUlRrdjFyRVpQb2xTS2RxZ1VuZE9POHRjeXliTVdGbTBXU2JkQTlpRGJvWXVqUzlTZGFRMHNiZGZUWjdpUzJOTzRwZUVqZnc9PQ==
"Very interesting! I've heard that basically if you behave yourself and use some common sense you will have no issue. It's something I've always thought would be interesting to do, but then there is the argument that for every dollar you spend as a tourist you are supporting the regime, and with the current political climate, I think I will watch from afar. I think for the Vice guys, they probably figured out they were up to something and put them through extra scrutiny.",r/northkoreanews,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhYkkxQW9OZ1VOcWhSOW1tUmxuZ205VWQ2VndpVlRlOXlzUU9FR3YyOXlZZGhtc21DUzkxbkhnb0dSY0tmUFFpVks3VVBwVDlQZjJVYlpTNlUzb2xfYmc9PQ==
