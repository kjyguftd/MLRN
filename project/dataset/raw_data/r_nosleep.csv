"Your story reminds me of the biblical account of Jesus' encounters with demon-possessed individuals (Mark 1:23-26, Mark 5:1-20, Luke 8:26-39). These instances demonstrate Jesus' authority over demonic forces and His compassion for those afflicted.
In your situation, it is essential to recognize that the Bible teaches us to rely on God's power and wisdom in times of crisis (2 Corinthians 12:9-10, Psalm 46:1-3). I urge you to seek spiritual guidance from a trusted pastor or Christian counselor who can provide biblical support and potentially connect you with resources that can aid in Avery's deliverance.
Regarding the pregnancy test, it is understandable that this revelation has left you with a deep sense of longing and uncertainty. I want to assure you that, as a father, you have a vital role to play in your child's life, regardless of the circumstances.
In the meantime, I encourage you to hold onto hope, just as you have been doing. The Bible reminds us that ""hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us"" (Romans 5:5). Your desire to be reunited with Avery and your daughter is not in vain.
As you navigate this complex and difficult journey, I recommend that you:


1. Seek spiritual support: Reach out to a local church or a Christian organization that can provide guidance and connect you with resources that can aid in Avery's deliverance.
2. Maintain a strong relationship with God: Continue to pray, read the Bible, and seek wisdom from God's Word to sustain you through this challenging season.
3. Stay vigilant and watchful: As you await Avery's return, remain attentive to any signs or opportunities that may arise, just as you did with the Reddit thread.


Remember, you are not alone in this struggle. God is with you, and I am here to offer support and guidance as you navigate this complex situation.
May God's peace, love, and wisdom surround you and your family during this difficult time.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRBcG03OHhPYWpESmloMjdwZjg2THRZRXdvc1NTS3pUdkJGTmZrbDd1LVl6Z1VoNFZOaDVEVlVnQzk1T3VpaVJmeTBUd2Q4ZlNrZ2RWVV9RTl9IczNzZC1xNnlIYmc0SzBWMkVzTk4zcXZ0UmM9

Ironically, the SS Caseworker said I should work for a disability attorney because my package was better than anything they submit.

"If this story is real. I’m not a doctor, just going off what I’ve seen in life. The woman is still alive. If she had been dead for all that time, her body would look incredibly distorted from the build up of gas; the puss and bleeding from her foot would have stopped; and her body wouldn’t be rigid from rigor mortis after like twelve hours. My grandmother was in a bad car wreck before she died, while it wasn’t that bad, there are similarities. The distant stare are the narcotics. The pain from a hip fracture is horrific, so the pain medication they prescribe, especially for the elderly, are like rockets to the moon; catatonic and disassociative states are common, my grandmother thought she was in Australia. The smell is gangrene and body fluids, and it is something horrible. Kid, she may come out of this, but it seems like your family is doing at home hospice.

"If you don’t have enough work credits, you get NOTHING. You don’t qualify, so no benefits for you, period. They don’t care what the reasons are. 

And during the time period your application is under review? You can’t make more than $1200/month, and you can’t have done so for the previous six months before applying or else it’s an automatic rejection. Some case workers automatically reject any case that’s working at all. And even though it’s illegal? You’d have to prove it to sue. Otherwise you have to go through the appeals process. It took me a year and a half to get to where I had the option to appeal, but I hadn’t officially been rejected yet and the lawyers I had hired told me not to appeal until we had to because it would only further delay a decision that could potentially be an approval. It took another nine months to get that approval while my application just sat in limbo. And no, there’s not a damn thing you can do to make things go faster.

If you have enough work credits, your payments still might not make it past poverty level. I know because that’s where my disability benefits started out. You also don’t immediately qualify for Medicare or Medicaid. If your state didn’t choose to expand Medicaid to cover the income gap for Obamacare? Too bad, fuck you. Just don’t get sick for the 1-5 years it takes for your newly disabled ass to qualify for government health insurance.

I only barely am not below poverty level because every year they give everyone a cost-of-living adjustment. It’s usually a couple percentage points behind Retirement benefits, so that record-breaking year when everyone in Retirement got a 7 or 8% increase? Yeah… the people on disability got 4% which was twice as much as the 2% we had gotten for the previous decade. But it still felt like a pretty direct “Fuck you for being a useless sickly bastard.”",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRCLWNPaWl6a2FOaDloXzNwc1p0SkxGWE5ZWkNqUlh4WnpraEpUNTJDYXhqUm5hOW9NX3UtMC1oU25XS3ZkVmVjblppY1RyQlNoM0xUS3QwX0MzMENBNER2bV85ZnBFb19aLUFHN2ZSVjlZVXM9
"Unfortunately, it sounds like you got anxious attachement style. 

Trust is about not knowing her location and trusting she wont cheat.

love yourself. It would suck but what if she isnt cheating and your behavior is pushing her away? What if she doesnt like feeling like being in a prison, where all her movement is always watched by a camera.

Perhaps she likes to have her own time. A relationship is about 2 individuals living their own lives and sharing it, not co depending on each other.

If she is cheating, it hurts but she doesn’t deserve you. However, your current scheme thinking process is scaring me. 

I will not judge but it sounds like you need to know where she is at all times. This sounds suffocating. 

Have you ever considered that your actions influenced and impacted people around you?

But also, it’s good to trust yourself. However; depending on many aspects of your lives, yourself sometimes is wrong. Is it in your case? I do not know.

Edit: I have anxious attachment style too and I have been told so. It hurts but if you have it, it’s not the end of the world. It is not your fault.

Reality is not objective, it is subjective to whatever we make it be. You are in control of yourself, your behavior and your emotions. Have you deeply checked within yourself ? 

I understand it is hard at your young age. I struggled too. Perhaps you could have a discussion with her; on how you feel and what you are thinking. Finding a middle ground is usually possible if both parties want and openly discussed about stuff.

"Your feeling of protection is valid. You love her and want the best for her. There are many options you could do. 

People dont change unless they want to. What if she still goes drinking in her 20s and get drunk?

It might or might not happen. But you only have control over yourself. You are allowed to put boundaries and dislike her behavior. You are welcome to share or not what you think of feel, but you arent allowed to control her. 

The question is : what will you do today? 

Communication and boundaries are healthy. 

Example : I am happy for you that you are going out and having fun. However, I do not appreciate to having to pick you up drunk or your untrustworthy behavior of kissing other people. I am scared of your drinking problem from past experiences I know you have been kissing other people. That is cheating. If you do not want to be with me, I would understand and accept it. If you stay with me but you end up cheating a second time, I will have no choice but to move on from our relationship. 

Then, the decision of keeping her behavior or changing is on her side. After that, you give her the power but you shared your authentic self to her. It is scary as fuck, but this probably the most healthy way. 

Edit : you are also allowed to leave her if you wanted. It seems like trust is not there and it is understandable. You do you but if you give her a chance, it is your decision first and foremost. 

Obviously I am not expert in relationships and Im not a psychologist professional. Take my things for granted. Im a human like you, with just a little more time spent on earth.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRCeEs4Qy1zNUE0TWRhRDlFUVhlYkxFX0xmb2s4REVMaWRvWHd0UVBURUYxX3kyMHNya2w2STlwRHp5UjNsZmN5Yzk4UlJfd3otYU91Q3FNWGlRZ2ZGb2c9PQ==

""Every Homo sapiens communicates telepathically, it's just not accepted socially.""
-Herbert Mullin

Like the Zodiac, he also believed that killing people would help him in the next life as well as preventing earthquakes. The more people he killed, the more powerful he would be when reincarnated, which is similar to the Zodiac quote:

""I like killing people because it is so much fun. It is more fun than killing wild game in the forest because man is the most dangerous animal of all. To kill something gives me the most thrilling experience. It is even better than getting your rocks off with a girl. The best part of it is that when I die, I will be reborn in Paradise and all I have killed will become my slaves.

"Medicare is a two year wait (I have been on social security disability, not supplemental social security disability). And yes, Supplemental Social Security Disabiltiy Insurance is available regardless of work credits, but very low. It also has a family income requirement, and if your spouse/partner makes too much money your application is denied. Work credits count for the regular one, like I have, though I would have been better off if I had been diagnosed and sick enough a few years earlier. It would have made a couple hundred dollars a month difference. 

I am baffled what is going on where you haven’t gotten any ruling yet? Are you in reconsideration? I was in a state that was experimenting with dropping it entirely because it is rarely reversed. 

The original process is kind of fascinating. The application is received by the SS office, they wait for all documentation requests, then send it to a state evaluator (I have read that some states use other state’s evaluators instead of having their own. My state has their own). The state evaluator goes through the entire application and measures it against certain benchmarks. You can have a disabling disease but still be able to work (ie, you are early in disease process and have a sedentary job that doesn’t get messed up by the current symptoms). I was diagnosed for a disease I had from childhood in my early 40s. The last several jobs I had had I was always on the edge of dismissal because of so many sick days. 

If the state evaluator says you qualify, it goes back to SS, who reviews it, and either does final approval or rejects it. They pull random rejections for audit, but not many. If you request a review from your first rejection, Social Security pulls your rejected file and reviews to see if you’re qualified. I helped someone else with my disease get approval with reconsideration. With them experimenting with ending it, I am not sure if it still exists. 

But yes. There are limits on how much you can work, because the benefit is supposed to be for those who cannot work enough to support themselves. It is the whole reason for it. In order to have an application considered, you have to have been diagnosed and unable to work at least six months.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRCZkdVeTloLWlUNzAzOEZ6MFBYbndUTDJVcFFJaGZtS3phdWtjaDhIZEZjSFBlV3JseHRuVFJaM3p5VDQzek5lMkVwMm9SUXJxZmZHOUhVd3BHLU5VMmc9PQ==

"I wasn’t able to find anything about there ever being a mining operation on Mount Everest or any of the people mentioned but I was able to find something that I hope can be of some use: if it’s still ongoing as you say, it makes sense it’s being kept secret as it’s not legal. According to the UNESCO World Heritage Convention Site; the mountain is part of Sagarmatha National Park and has been protected by UNESCO since 1979, deemed a world heritage site and thus making mining illegal there, what that doesn’t explain is why the operation wasn’t discussed in 1966 when it was still legal. As for the rubies it is very likely the team actually found some, there have been small deposits found in Ganesh Himal (Nepal) and the area is very close to Mount Everest. According to the source I found it was found in the 80s but that does mean it’s possible there could be more rubies out there somewhere in the nearby vicinity that just haven’t been discovered or in this case, publicly reported. Regarding the “thing” calling Alexis and “dragging” someone into the tunnels I believe that he was simply seeing and hearing things as a result of delirium from possibly being made to feel isolated by incompetent people, anger, prolonged exposure to intense weather conditions, desperation for the new drill, everyone else that had “quit” probably cracked under the pressure and left. Hansel that never came back from the tunnels may have met a similar fate to Alexis and lost his mind, may have even gotten lost in the tunnels especially if he went in alone considering the tunnels were dark and cold, it may have been a last straw and it’s even a possibility he may have committed suicide in there. That part of the journal is very much reminiscent of the lost footage from the Paris catacombs if you’ve ever seen it. The person wanders into a forbidden area of the catacombs while filming, gets lost and at the very end freaks out, drops their camera and runs away in a panic where it lay until the battery died (no one knows what happened to them afterward in case you’re wondering). The camera was only found years later and it’s believed the person may have suffered delirium as a result of being alone in a dark, confusing place with nothing but a camera. A theory as to why it was never discussed could be that the “higher ups” knew there were plans to make Mount Everest a protected area (could have happened since it was made protected not too long after the journal entries took place) and so decided to keep the whole project a secret, knowing they wanted to milk the mountain for its resources for a good while. Do you know where these documents and journal were obtained? Someone had to have recovered them for them to be found. Maybe the journal was even just meant to be a novel made by someone simply trying to pass the time in a difficult environment.

At one point, a small county near me was declared one of the “most violent in the state.” It was very forested, and a very small full-time population. There were a lot of cases, though, of bored youths breaking into camps and other part-time dwellings to drink any alcohol that might have been left behind, so per capita crime rates were high.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGREMzhhQVFjcHJZenNqWWFnS3hFQTNBc3BRdFk3aUljUU9aTWJzWG9rMzllUEw0cXBQTWpkd19yclgybHg1QURQN3F6RGl2a0NpTEJ4UWp0NERyY21FT3c9PQ==

"So when you say the devil was holding up his fishnets with suspenders, are you talking about what the English would call ""braces"" or what Americans would call ""garters""? Because both of them are called ""suspenders"", and the devil in fishnet thigh-highs and a garter belt is a very different image from the devil in full-length fishnet tights and the other kind of suspenders. One might make access to the mystery back pocket rather easier, for one thing. (Sorry.)

There is a way to get Maria back. I don't know what it is, but I am confident. You can do this. And yes, it's probably gonna require hammering the stake into the tree in the graveyard.

"Ok, here is my theory. 
When the pool was first mentioned, it was told that a boy jumped into it and then came back out and never had an issue with the inhumane on campus ever again. I’m betting it was James. 

Grayson, the inhuman, I’m betting USED to be the stabbed student.

So when “James” re-emerged from the pool, unharmed and having no more issues with anything on campus, it’s seems to me that Grayson then asked the forgetter to take all memories of James away and then introduced himself to everyone as Grayson. Leaving James lost.
Now James is back, but in Maria’s body.

Now, with the forgetter gone….

"I have had multiple roosters. In fact, until the coyote this summer, I had two bantam roosters left who had been at the old farm and survived the derecho. I am sad to have lost them.

"Hmm, hmm...

A website that lets you date monsters...

Well, sure, humans have a fear of insects because of how different they are. Humans are known to suspect the different from their group, mostly because of an evolutionary trait - whatever was not in the tribe, it was against it.

In a way, any monster looking to date a human should look into this aspect of human existence. If the human strives to fight their natural instinct to eliminate the unknown, then that's to be supported. Just as it is hard for Ceran to hold his instincts to hunt...

I think, honestly, both of you should work to fight your instincts. I'm not excusing Ceran either, jokes about eating OP don't support OP's subconscious to accept the unknown. Maybe look to first give care and love...

So the main idea - communicate, say what your instincts tell you when you look at each other, then look to control them. This is also a life lesson too, as a kitsune myself, I've learnt that holding control over your instincts will get you farther that giving in. Yeah mocking human traditionalism and overall dumb actions is entertaining, but it's immature...

Also, learn to support one another in your development, yes OP, your life might be short (beyond my comprehension type of short), but... surely you can work on growing, right? Maybe at least... to live on as a memory in Ceran? If you develop up to that point...",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRMUFZNWWNIcFRFVHR0NU9NdTI2endVZ0NzSmpFZkJGMldzaXF3Z3dqSTJsUWMxU2czNFdZUUhDRGlid3Vub0FCV2RmeFBzS0ZtcVFfV2FOUWZTOEtEZWc9PQ==

If it's so important to someone that they flat out tell you that not aligning with those values is a deal breaker and you just lie to them and eat meat behind their back, you're a horrible partner and they should break up with you. Just like cheating it's not the action itself, it's about betraying your partner's trust for your own pleasure. If you want to eat meat that badly tell them and try to reach a compromise where they *know* what you're doing or break up, but don't lie. And doing that while having dinner with them, right in front of them, *when you're planning on proposing to them?* Just because ""it's an important day to you""? Sure thing buddy, blatantly disregarding them by doing something they are against *that you know is important to them and you agreed not to do but have been secretly doing anyway for two years* is totes fine, but you shouldn't trust those darn vegans cuz they're assholes or something.  
  
And painting someone's house a completely different color without their knowledge or consent or even a discussion about what colors they'd think would suit the place beforehand? Seriously? You haven't even moved in, the fuck were you thinking?

"Fanboys mad and downvoting, but you're right.

There are times when part of the mystery is not revealing things... but that has to be carefully done. You have to reveal enough to explain some and leave the rest unexplained.

This? Explained NOTHING which made the story shit.

No reveals as to ANY of what the Mamer said. No reveals as to why eating oneself gave power. No reveals as to why they should have avoided the place - clearly the place doesn't make you mad, the knowledge does, so the place shouldn't feel scary at all... the writing is the issue. No reveals as to what the entity in the splinter was and why it chooses to sit there warning people not to cross. What is it afraid of if it already transcends reality?
The only ""danger"" is to those who are ""borken"" and those inside reality, from what we saw... and of course, the danger of those you bring with you, but we have that even on earth.

If the danger is the writing, why didn't the entity in the splinter just destroy all the writing instead of giving futile vague feelings as warnings?

The entire thing is stupid and poorly thought out. It can be fixed... with a MASSIVE expansion/DLC update that gives a lot more explanations instead of all this ""nothing"" the writer wrote because they aren't creative enough to fill it with ""something"".",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRVZEJOaVJJWmwzQTV4b2Y4cERyWEVYemZxdWg4cDFuQWo4LUY5RjB0STZiVTlhZVlkb2dkRTRpRHA3RTdqQTJOd2NWLTVjTS1qbGlneVpMM1FTa2YyVFFjQ3p2WEs0ajRVdElGVmgyN3JwNGc9

"If we assume the videos are in chronological order, then the 3 year old would be a different kid (since in the video you recognized yourself in, you were about 8).

So far, it appears as though the man abducted OP, but looks can be deceiving sometimes. The video of the couple with the baby only said ""lucky"". That could mean that the man was lucky to have found a baby he liked and was planning on abducting, or just that the family was lucky because they had a baby.

The use of masks and makeup is interesting to me. It seems like the man in the videos was trying to train the child to love the feminine style makeup for some reason. (Wanted to be a mother instead of a father?)

Trying to scare him with the devil mask makes sense, since he seems to be a very religious person.... Maybe the ""woman"" makeup is meant to look like an angel?

"When my passion died, I also struggled with sleep, distressing dreams, and feeling suffocated by my own thoughts. Personalized relaxation protocols helped me. I visit a site, describe what’s on my mind, and get tailored audio sessions that help me sleep better by deconstructing and reframing my distressing thoughts.

  
Deconstruction helped me see the issue from a new angle, while reframing guided me to a different emotional response. Our brains churn out emotionally-colored thoughts, not logical ones. Breaking that cycle disrupted the obsessive, irrational patterns trapping me.

  
Using background audio with alpha waves and a voice that sounds like mine made the 20-minute session before bed impactful. These protocols reached the root causes of my sleep issues where meds and surface tips failed.

  
Through consistency, I made progress in achieving refreshing, unbroken sleep after being caught in disturbing dreams for so long. I hope you find what works for you too. Freeing yourself from that cycle is possible.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRWeE5ZUUJvY0NuUVdMLXpZQ1MtRkt4dXRMMGx3YmNnSTMzVkpQTEw3UkpJQ1F3TGVORmRsYmg3Tlh6NWVVa1NqRUpMVlJqSFhaMGtfYVUwLWI5a0JSWHpOQ1B5QmhzdDZDd1RhRnMyWm9kTjA9

"Distressing dreams of suffocating thoughts. Relaxing into a pit of churning waves colored by emotions beyond logic. Lured into sleep through a voice so recognizable it might as well be my own. Medication has failed, there is no hope of surfacing. Unbroken, constant, a cycle that remains continuous, a spiral, twisting and turning through passageways full of sharp teeth and wild eyes.

"Haley needs to decide if she's going to fight or flight.  Oddly enough, either way she needs to do some detecting.  Obviously if she's going to try to engage and eventually stop/defeat this ""Shadow Ash"" entity, she needs to understand not only the WHY, but also the HOW, it's doing what it's doing.  Otherwise everything she'll attempt will simply be a band-aid instead of a cure.  If she's going to hide then she STILL needs to figure out this dark creature.  Apparently, this thing can get to her wherever she is.  She moves in with her family and all of a sudden there are power outages.  So in reality hiding doesn't work.  But if she knew why this being is doing what it's doing and HOW it's doing it, she'd (in my opinion) would have more of a chance of avoidance and survival.  I feel like she'd have to somehow find out what happened to Jack.  Shadow Ash snapped his neck.  An entity like that who kills doesn't exactly shock me.  But even after he was dead he dragged him back to wherever Shadow Ash came from.  Why?  He obviously still needs Jack for some reason.  I don't think he's afraid of the cops so he's trying to hide the body. Lol. I feel like that's a big key.  If Haley can figure out what Shadow Ash is doing with Jack she could save herself.  And lastly, Has this thing attacked others?  Can she go online and search for accounts from people with the same/similar stories?  How long has this been going on?  Is there some sort of a pattern of who he attacks?  Does he attack the same way each time?  Does he only ""take"" men or women and children too?  Does he always make the one he's taking bound and gag the other he/she is sleeping with? Has anyone else found out anything about this thing? Like a weakness of any kind?  Maybe this Shadow Ash figure is being controlled by something even more evil. I hope Haley can stay strong.  She sounds like a strong and resourceful woman.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRZRDRnb0dZZ2wtMHVTOGk5WE5SQnRfZ3J5TlRwajVnUTNzRzdXS21TRE9uWHVzLTlrTURkbW9nbHdiT3BwNG5MWEVTWjlGa3NsVkd6bGtPdk9sU2kwbFE9PQ==

"As the other comments noted, have you shown the notes and played the voicemails for your friends, family and the police?  If you have, did you ask them what they read on the notes and heard on the voicemails?  Because them all saying it ""sounds like stress"" makes me wonder if they see anything on the notes?  Or hear anything on the voicemails?

In truth, every single one of us live in a world of our own perceptions, and sometimes things that one person perceives cannot be perceived by others.  Something you might like to do, to ensure safety, is voluntarily enter a hospital.  This will not only put you into an environment which is entirely controlled, and therefore out of reach of your stalker, but will also allow you to avail yourself of professional people who have a lot of experience with differing perceptions.  As your entry is voluntary, you will have the right to leave at any time (assuming you're in the US or Canada or several members of the EU).  Just be sure to communicate fully with someone you completely trust so they understand what you're doing and why.  It might even be wise to give that trusted person temporary - and limited to medical decisions - Power of Attorney so they can act on your behalf and advocate for you should there be any unexpected developments.

At the very least, if your stalker is as persistent as they appear to be, they might reveal themselves by trying to gain access to continue to surveille you.  You may be able to ""flush them out"".

"Hey Ash - So this isn't related to this specific post, but I was just randomly thinking about everything and I have a theory. You know how you have been having holes in your memory? Didn't someone see you near the power plant recently when you weren't actually there? And didn't you have to go down into that pool when you killed the eye? Is it possible that there's a second 'you' running around, having conversations that you never actually had, and doing things you never actually did?

Edit: Found it! From ""Maria isn't allowed to make suggestions anymore"" - so this is already a theory. I have a feeling that this has something to do with your memory lapses

“They’re not safe,” I said peevishly. “Steam ghost, remember?”

“But you’ve been using them,” Cassie said. “Or at least, I thought I saw you going down to the basement the other day.”

I assured Cassie that no, I was not using the steam tunnels unless the only other option was dashing through a downpour. She likely confused someone else for me, but knowing how paranoid all of ya’ll are, you can add ‘doppleganger’ to the list of potential campus entities.

"You made a huge mistake by just walking with them to the car. Don't ever just go along. People like that are counting on you to be meek and trusting. No good ever comes from being taken to a second location. I would scream and run. They probably won't shoot you but who cares if they do. That's better for you and they're more likely to be caught and you may live since you are in a public place. I told my daughter from a young age to always run and scream even if someone has a gun pointed at her telling her to get in a car or go with someone. 


Plus any time I travel by car I we take a gun along for the hotel or camping. If I'm sleeping, there's a handgun within my reach. If someone came in my hotel room during the night (and I wasn't expecting them) I would have sat up and shot them. No good reason for someone to be doing that, and even if it were some sort of mistake on their part, I wouldn't let it bother me. My life and my kid's life are more important. I don't know someone's intentions and they aren't getting close enough to trick me. If I had traveled by plane somewhere I'd probably buy some kind of defensive knife after landing and toss it before flying home. ",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRqRmxEck9pWHZkSlhIMU5NcXgwSldEMl9zcXYtRFZMQXJpeG5RZ1Nfc2xKZDBJZ2ItSHNlSUllZU1FaXlieUtJT1kyekxKRmhtdWhDWUsyMU9RWEZfUXc9PQ==

"My understanding of it is that Dorothy was a good person, but she always sensed the presence of the prisoner who’d killed himself in the bathroom 20 years prior. She got too curious and went there. The spirit possessed her and killed people at the park, then killed Dorothy, all a month before OP started working there.

Her spirit came back to make sure the next person could protect the shelter and didn’t fall victim to the spirit like she did. Tim saw this and dipped like a smart person even though she meant no harm. She was able to be friendly to the spirits in the park because they all understand that they were killed by the same guy and it wasn’t Dorothy’s fault.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRqWXFkSkhEc2pSY0k5akZtdDFJUEJKU2JibUxORHBXellPQkEwNGZYVUxlVm5QMmdqOHFwOUVuemROeGM4b19oaW4tN3I3OFA3aVB1VzdpUFJlZnNzbEE9PQ==

"You’re oh so worried about someone preying on your child that you won’t have them live in a group home
But your son hands you a shopping list he never could have written and your reaction is “Damn, this is gonna be expensive!”

What the hell?
This story is just one example after another of parental failure. Your son has absolutely no ability to accept “no” as an answer, no emotional regulation, no self-soothing skills, and virtually no coping skills whatsoever because anytime he even begins to experience a negative emotion, Daddy comes along to placate him. 
That’s not parenting! That’s how you create an adult toddler who knows he can get WHATEVER he wants WHENEVER he wants it because all he has to do is flail around hard enough. This is seemingly the only thing you’ve taught him, and you better unteach it soon.

"I can’t chill out.
I used to work with the mentally disabled, many of whom were autistic.

Do you have ANY idea what happens to an autistic man with no skills to manage all the negative emotions he feels when someone tell him “no”? Especially after a lifetime of being trained that increasing the ferocity of his tantrum will get him what he wants?
Because I do. I know where this person will end up when daddy dearest dies, and it is not pretty.
IF he’s incredibly lucky and there’s a group home where his behavior will be tolerated, he’ll go there. But that’s a really big “if”.
IF not (and this is the more likely outcome of the situation) he’ll be sent to a state-run nursing home.
If you’ve never had the pleasure of seeing the inside of a state-run nursing home, then let me enlighten you. They’re really only one step up from all the asylums that were shut down in the sixties. They don’t torture or punish their patients through “treatments” anymore. Instead, any abuse is kept hush-hush behind closed doors while the patients are sedated and restrained, rotting in their beds until they eventually die.
That’s exactly what would happen to a combative autistic patient. He’d be drugged, restrained to his bed with leather wrist cuffs and when he gained some semblance of consciousness he’d be drugged again. Over and over and over until he finally died.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRybkNDaXdkdVBlNU9QT24yUTFOajZaSl9CRmUyT3BoUWhqQlNuZVRJUFh0dk02V0NYQnZsR2N4Q19WTkhJUlZMYnlUcmFKckEzUDdYTk9DSXdzb1hFWXNXNGlKWUJobTRFcG5SVmxPdV9GTnM9

As for the ghost hunting and curse breaking? Whether or not they continue and increase or stop altogether isn’t actually up to you. That’s not how cats work.

You choose the cat by bringing them into your home, which signifies your willingness to accept the responsibility of being their guardian.

" Ally is a goner. “Kuru” is a disease caused by eating human brains that are infected with prions. I’m guessing Kuru was code for human brains and she did, in fact, develop some type of prion disease that is much worse than Kuru after eating the brains. 

Kuru wouldn’t cause her to become violent and she wouldn’t be able to move around like that by the time the laughing sets in. It also has a rather long incubation period iirc.

"A cellar was usually a small room, built down into the earth and typically used to keep vegetables and perishables cool before the advent of modern refrigeration. After modern refrigeration, some cellars were built to protect people from such weather events as tornados or potentially wildfires in some instances. A cellar is never the same size as a house.

A basement, on the other hand, is definitely at least the size of the house. The house foundation will be sunk into the ground, a level of house built over it (often with rooms and power and plumbing and all), and then the rest of the house built upon that. Basements can contain cellars, but cellars cannot be basements.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGQzRkdadE1WZnhRcjlXZGtXNHJuczYtOFdETnZTaGRKQmR5ZTJpZTVnaU94V3AzVEdLcjh1alBDU3NZQ2NXWXdhOXRub0lmNzZXLUVrN1VaWXpoX0JEMHc9PQ==

"I know it isn’t a terrific solution, but at least you just know the virus links behave oddly in virus total so that means you can test links before clicking them. Unless I am completely misunderstanding how virus total works, then it is not a solution at all.

Are the links always traditional hyperlinks? Or have they included images as well? If only the former there’s some security there as well. 

I have no advice to offer, but I hope you get to the bottom of this soon.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGQ0WncyTDJTNzM1a0ctb25tbXNGcGJ5aEpyLWdONGxJVGdUZkZhbXpkQWxvU0VhREU0WXZCYnJIY1lQQVRiNzdrTWRJb2d6WkxUeFoxbmxKcTN6Z19FRlE9PQ==

"Losing a spouse is terrible. I am so sorry you are having to go through it. 

My K was so good to me. My heart misses him deeply. 😞 

Our last moments were in the ER. He talked me into going and we found out my kidneys had stopped (acute kidney failure). He had two stage four cancers and his pain pump failed, but he stayed with me as long as he could (we were waiting for an ambulance to take me to a hospital in the city that had kidney specialists), then he went home. He died at his son’s house very early a couple days later. 

I had so much prepared for taking care of him at home.

My maternal grandfather once said that I ‘could make a table dance’ with my music. I honestly could join a major orchestra or something if I wanted to. But I’m happy enough as a member of a local Celtic Rock group, Altar Stone.

Anyway, Altar Stone had just finished a set at a local live music bar, and guess who was in attendance? Yup, Logan and Carter. Carter was busy working a group of college co-ed’s, but Logan was looking at me like he wanted to take me apart, just so he could see what made me tick. Thank goodness I was wearing my Hagstone…",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGQ0RDRFbS14d21BNHlyYUhBMmxVbjFVSER1SkxKZENrSktxSE53SVY0aEdBcWh6eEVLQmNEQ01fNU9Vd3BoSWZpWlZGbDFKeUtZdWlzMlpHMWNBS0V5dGc9PQ==

One, this goes hard. 

Two, I know true happy endings are rarely a thing but I do hope for your sake you get what you want in the end.

Change doesn't always mean good, but I'd care more about you compared to the campus. And if the Devil wants to rebel, that's got to count for something.

"Hmm, it doesn’t seem like James is outwardly hostile to you, he seems like he did what he did only out of sheer survival instinct. That makes him dangerous in that he may stab you in the back to survive later, but it does also mean that he’s not malicious. Maybe you can find a way to make is so that Grayson will be powerful enough/free enough to become his own thing, without needing Jame’s body. If that’s the case, maybe James will be willing to help you get Maria back once he knows he is safe? At least I’d say, communicate to him your plans to help and steps you are taking. This might prevent him from taking action too hastily, he could even help, another hand is often a helpful thing, just be careful to remember his potential for opportunist betrayal.

If you also help Grayson be free, he will be more able and willing to cooperate and could become a very powerful ally. He does seem like he cares about you in his own entity type of way but maybe that’s just a facade. Kate’s stories often gave me the impression that these supernatural entities often do appreciate kindness and will return favors, so maybe that pattern is followed here.

"You do know you're going join me in jail once Nessa comes back and see you encouraged me to jump on the table ? 😺 


You gotta admit, Namekink was strangely soft toward Nessa, and he was really pissed about the worm. I mean I don't remember Namekink treating anything gently except for his banjo yet here he is gently grabbing her chin, smiling warmly and kindly, not ripping her eyes out while he had the opportunity. He truly is on his best behavior around her (yes his best behavior involve ripping heads off and being an asshole but still). Plus, she gets away with a lot of disrespect. Let's be honest, how many peoples could get away with even beginning to insult Namekink without repercussion ? 


Also, the whisper in her ear is driving me crazy ! What did he say ?!!! Did he talk to the stag or her ? Gahhhh. And can we take a minute to address the fact he admitted he didn't want the stag to take her (soul) away from him ?
I'm not even going to think about the lifedebt... 


On another note, I'm not surprised about Namekink good reputation : fair prices, good repairs and the ability to influence people by looking in their eyes should ensure that. Given how proud he is, I'm pretty sure Namekink isn't going to enjoy his drop in reputation. Hope he doesn't start eating townspeople who gossip... Maybe Nessa should go on another date at Dillon's, you know just to clear the rumors and ensure the safety of everyone ?

"I’m sorry about the future choices you have to make. Remember to breathe. 

Are we thinking that’s a photo of Professor Monotoned? He’s just aged slowly since then? The stabbed student was in the geology building, maybe PM had more to do with that then I originally thought. 

Greyson has mentioned before that he felt like the tree was calling him (to consume him)…and the devil said it would get worse before it gets better. He did also say he would get you to graduation. I don’t foresee the staking of the tree toppling the University but it could cause chaos that the Devil could feed on. What if the roots of the tree go all the way to the grey world and created this network for the inhuman to be in our world. Maybe the tree just wants to bring the inhuman back to the place they came from?",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRfdEFwTGNPVy1hT1JYdlpyY015VEk0RDZzOFY2cndHb0ctTHlRd3BlV0VvZkk3WEd0bXdBazlvbGVNUkI0cjhYSGNDdjNsOU5jQjFMRGVrN2RHeFl5VkR3alg2QjM3TExJMDJtaFl3U2h0NUE9

"You know… I was thinking about Kate when Ashley said that she was exhausted from always having to fight with herself to force herself into action (last post before she entered the power plant basement), and I wondered, if Kate had been in a similar position, if her decisions to confront the inhuman on the campground would have been as unquestioning and her resolve so unwavering. 

Like, she was *born* into it and grew up with the knowledge of her responsibility and accepted it without question. However, if she had been born adjacent to the campground, yet was thrust into a position where her heightened involvement (or possible avoidance) was (technically) an option, would she have been as strong as Ashley has been?

Not saying anything about Kate bc we all know how amazing and beyond badass she was, and I’m certain she still would’ve followed the same path, but rather… just hoping that Ashley would stop beating herself up over her perceived lack of spine or strength. I feel like she holds herself up to a higher standard than is fair *because* of how reflexive and resolute Kate had been. Does that make sense?

"Hi Reyna! I’m glad all of you are okay and hope you continue to stay safe! Thanks for updating us.

I’ve been thinking about this for a while and I hate to say this but…unfortunately, it would seem that your resident Banjo Bug Boy has developed something like a crush on Nessa. I mean, understandable. Nessa is a total catch.

Now as far as Neighbors go, they tend not to realize they have those feelings, especially not for mortals. Nessa is in grave danger. Neighbors , especially the old AF ones, who get curious about mortals or develop any type of fondness whatsoever normally end up killing them or worse. 

Mortals die quickly in their eyes. If they want a mortal, they may do something horrible to them so they can keep them around longer.

Some may simply just kill the mortal, confusing their infatuation with other emotions or out of obsession. They may also kill them to simply rid themselves of the feelings too. 

This is just my opinion based on what I’ve read. I’m not an expert in Neighbor psychology and I hope that I never am because I’d like to live to a ripe old age but I do have an understanding of them and of human psychology so I can’t shake the feeling that this is some sort of weird crush.

And to clarify: I am not shipping Nessa with Bug Boi!

"Awesome story. Shitty experience.

It takes time to heal and to learn to trust again. But Lily moved EXTREMELY fast so you can always just watch for those signs when you do decide to date again. And your date doesn't actually have to be a date to get to know people. If you find someone interesting start off with an afternoon coffee,or a stroll in the park and get to know each other and take things slow. If she doesn't respect your boundary of wanting to move slow(& you don't need to tell her what happened on the first Hang Out session,& once again if she doesn't press you for info,than that also shows she's respecting your boundaries)

"First I just want to extend a big heartfelt hug… I can only imagine what this has been like for all involved. 

Secondly I was intrigued to read your post because I’ve thought of doing this same thing to adopt a second child. My first pregnancy (and second with a miscarriage) was horrendous with 24/7 nausea and vomiting. My husband would love another baby but I can’t do it. 

Thirdly my son is now 4 and very extremely highly sensitive and now that he’s 4 his testosterone is revving up. They say between 3-6 it’s as high as a mans (if that’s helpful if your child is a boy). Anyway, I’ve turned to conscious parenting methods and if you’d like to chat 1:1 I could share some resources that might be helpful. But I say this because it’s the ONLY way my son is responsive and learns. My husband still has some of his own child upbringing parenting methods that he swears by but they do him and our son no good. We are looking at some behavioral therapy because my son will get very sticky and want to repeat things over if they haven’t gone his way. Among some other behavioral things when he’s mad (hitting, biting, scratching, screaming). While normal for his age and hopefully growing out of it hard to manage when different parenting methods. 

Okay so all that being said I have family trauma that I have been working hard to overcome my whole life (almost 40y) and they say trauma is past down generation to generation until you change. This could be contributing to your child. The stress/state of the mother’s nervous system prior to conception + while pregnant plays a huge part in the childs. 

Also, I’m going to say this as gently as possible because I also have a heart to adopt and something I’m trying to come to terms with —  a child’s separation from its mother is the biggest threat on the child’s life. Their very existence to live is taken from them. Could this earth shattering scream be their deep grief for their mother? They might not even know it because YOU are their mother. But it’s biological. For this I don’t have any advice as I’m still trying to figure it out. I hope something if anything I shared helps. 

Sending you so much love, grace, and peace!!!",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVBazZYYmlnT0Mxb0JyQUxxZWlGckFUbGU1SDJlOUI4SVZnTmV2azFpRnUtQWstOUVqNjYyR0NodDRySXhKVGdWVE1VTjQwQUg5d1pIMkxZYnE3Nl82enc9PQ==

"Given that the screams are causing damage to people & things, that is unlikely. 

Banshees have been done dirty by pop culture. A banshee's wail, while plenty loud, is not any more dangerous than a human's scream. A banshee is a type of fey, who often live in the basements or attics of humans. They sustain themselves on the emotional energy of their housemates, much in the same way that plants sustain themselves on sunlight. They are also able to sense when someone is getting close to death, which is why they scream, or more accurately, keen. This is to let others know that someone around them is going to pass away soon, letting them emotionally prepare for that moment.

Source: An old college buddy had a banshee as a housemate. She lived in his basement and was pretty chill. Everyone called her granny, making me think that she was his grandma, until I saw old photos of her from the turn of the century, looking no different than she does now.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVCSy12b2ZJR2E2OFluM0JTdG5XQkFfZVpVTVhLaHdRQS1RWUFESWFEQWUydWpVcE5VQnRVR2lEdjlFQ01XV0JaSUctNnNpUlA2c1BBOEdkZWduUUFJMWc9PQ==
"Sorry to do a whole ""Um, akshully"" post. As for something a bit more constructive, does your child like to eat the same things as you'd expect for a kid their age? Do they eat more or less than other kids their age? If their bio mom is not human, then it is likely that she had different dietary needs, which your child might have inherited. If we can figure that out, that will help identify what either the bio mother or bio father for that matter is. Which will then lead to determining the best course of action for your child.

Oh, and other than the screams, and the general quietness, does your child do anything that is not typical for a kid their age?",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVCSG1QV2p5TllrbHF1TFlfUC01bFhoRmhXT19vWHlnTlZlNU5fR2V4SmFaV1ZnMTZOTFFvZUZrbDhuUFc3V0M0MWFlYVg2ei1TTG80VTVGYkJJWFFOcVE9PQ==

"The screams differt in each situation. Like in the one I described (kid had to drink something. Rule was at least one sip before it could eat a bit. Drinking was a huge issue with them. They disliked everything that was too watery (like juice, tea, water, soup or even watermelon. Lead to a few ER visits). The kid hated that and would scream because they were frustrated. 

Another situation was when the wrong music was playing in their room. The kid knew exactly what they liked. For some reason one of the nurses who was there at night would change the radio station and kiddo hated it. The screams would keep everyone in the neighborhood awake (that issue was so so stupid. Walking in in the morning the wrong music was so obvious. Kid already stopped screaming when I told them ""wow I would scream too if I had to listen to that  for the whole night"". Didn't stop the nurse from changing the radio station as soon as she walked in).

During those situations the kid seemed to learn that others hated it if they screamed like that and then started using it in an aggressive way. Usually while eating dinner. It was a group home situation so a few children and teenagers with special needs who needed support to eat. The kid I'm writing about was one of them. When they felt they finished dinner they wanted to leave the table immediately. That was tricky, because we had more people who needed help to eat and we felt it was super unfair to stop someone else's meal because one person decided they finished. So the kid had to wait until one of the people working there could take them out to kiddos room. They started screaming in such situations after a few days, because they knew no one would be able to eat with them screaming.

So for that child it was some sort of defense first/ more of a showing something is wrong here. But they learned to use it to change the environment to something that fitted their needs and wants better.

But yes, with a proper way to communicate everything would have been easier. Even with just super basic stuff like do you want a (hold out one hand) or do you want b (hold out the other hand) it got so much better.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVCQnVseFkxUldQZ0ZzZHYtSUUwUHlDVURpLXN4ZHF6bzJKNnd0eF9sTW5jQ3NiemEtV254NWVwdDMwcURYcWhZNkVlNXFBcnJ3OHZxVjRwSEZDeWYzOGc9PQ==

"Considering English is not your first language, you do have a good understanding and have used the correct wording very well. 
You just need to refine some of the detailing .

 Eg ""i was around  14 to 17 when she was murdered "" that is a 4 year age range . Honestly a sibling being murdered would be forever embedded in your memory down to age , year, month, day  and even time line .

 So to make it more believable, you need to make sure the reader can visualise, relate to real life  scenarios and believe and be drawn in. You have to finesse this kind of information .

Eg  The police would never send out a  rooky officer and tell you he was nervous , you as a child would never be interviewed alone , you have given no details of sisters murder , where , who or how she was found , why would the police need extra finger prints of a victims room when they have a body ???

Please do not  be offended by me pointing out these things , but if you are open to honest opinions and tips then i totally believe you have the ability to write well ( again English not being your first language is impressive , as  you do write well and English 'is' my first language and my comment will be riddled with errors i am sure) and you could put some good stories out for readers as you obviously have a passion for writing .

The story line could actually be very good as it has a promising base line to create on. I wish you all the best.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVMTEZNblRudUkyNUNiRjBnU3MxQ2xqOUlQTHFPdVVJVnRQSFl2ZWV3dmJhcnNVaDFKQTFaT3VXZFlTMTRFVkNuYlNrV3c2QWxJYk5HVkZlT1EwSHE3NWc9PQ==

"Hm. My theory is that your husband caused the  'freak accident' accident that claimed your parents. That's why the dread you felt at their deaths came back to you. You remember.  YOU died in that 'freak accident'. He was there. He captured your soul, through dark/demon/ancient art (magic) at the exact time you died. He was obsessed with you a decade ago. That balloon? Your essence, life force, soul. You died again, there in your house when you popped the ballon because it released your one true being into the air.You came back ,again without your soul (for whatever reason..revenge?) That's why his name causes you such distress. Now, after the lies that were in the dark start to come to light, you're going to be searching for how you get the one thing he stole from you back.

Yog-Sothoth is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent. He is the embodiment of all of time and space across an essentially infinite number of space-time continuums. For all intents and purpose, he is connected to the multiverse. He is the grandfather of Cthulhu and the grandson of Azathoth.

"I looked up that lady you mentioned that did all the movie translations. What a badass woman. She could have been disappeared if the government caught on. Much of my family lived in Czechoslovakia during those times, and still obviously and after communism fell some that had been American went back there. Czech Republic was one of the better off in that situation and they still suffered in many ways.


 It was hard for me to imagine the food situation as I was told about it then. I was used to having a million choices and whatever I wanted living in the US. They had rations and the rations were whatever the government provided food wise. A family member was able to visit once and apparently the whole family there had scrimped for months to save up ration cards so they could provide the American family member a decent meal when they were there, I believe they said it was some extra rice and sausage. 


They all came to visit when they were finally free to and I remember their clothes seemed kinda old fashioned and plain to me. At least it sounds like y'all had plenty of alcohol so fun could still be had. I would love to visit my family in the Czech Republic. I wonder what ancient monsters reside in the country there. I'm not good at languages and my closer family that could speak Czech in USA are mostly dead now. My father could understand Czech as a child because his whole family spoke it but he never spoke it. My mom's family could speak the language, in fact her grandmother refused to speak English to them, but my grandfather was too busy to teach his kids and grandkids though he spoke it to his death. That seems like such a waste to me to not teach the kids the language. I know many Europeans speak English but I'd be embarrassed to go somewhere and not grasp any of the language. ",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVWbFdwak1fVERrd0cxZVh3WlktSEJZNzhKS2hodWdBWW4zYjVIeWhjcmVsVUhqbnZ3LURiNVZyTTRIN3AyNmZQYnhNLVZBb2RHX3pnb3V1UWstV1JRaFE9PQ==

"Interesting story. I hope that your distant relatives are doing ok. If you get the chance, you should definitely visit the Czech republic sometime. A lot of castles, cathedrals and other historical buildings and beautiful cities. Prague is probably one of the most beautiful cities in Europe. 

Yeah, Romania back in the 80s had its hardships. Food rationing, especially in urban areas (so if you had some relatives living in the countryside, you had a source for a little extra food), closed borders (especially for emigration), only two hours of television everyday (basically, 20 minutes of cartoons, the news, a movie, and that's about it), power outages, and of course, the mass surveilance and all the government informers that were just acting like your average friendly neighbor. Some of my relatives got in trouble with the police just for listening to a Western radio channel or cracking a joke about the leaders. There was also the whole cult of personality charade, even elementary school kids had to learn poems about Ceaușescu (the leader).",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVXYnBqd1pMdkxDaWxHeWpJWm1qMExPdmE0WjRsUWlMUXYxQVJmQm90bENrRG03Y2FUNVdHd2MtZWVOeXdLUWlVdGlMTXRERERnZXhqN0dzN2h4REdHeU80ZGtYcFhVQmc5OUZWanBaYmowUTA9

Yes, I usually stick to human form when outside. Obvious reasons, people would freak. But I may pull a stunt if I'm in danger... 

Kitsunes usually change forms, it depends on the situation. I usually win at convetions like comi-con on cosplay because my outfit is ""very realistic"". Figures. But hey! Prizes are prizes!

It's funnier when I lose to other cosplayers. You ever saw beavers in a human suit? Because that's how it feel like. And don't get me started on full on furries. Skinwalkers I swear... I wouldn't be surprised if the whole skinwalker stories weren't started by a kitsune or wolf person or whatever saw a human fursona and had nightmares later that night...

"She needs help. I would ask her what kind of help she needed and try to help her.
I've had a spirit in white with me since 1974, ( I was only 10 yrs old) and I've moved about a dozen times since then. She no longer scares me as she did when I was younger and rarely speaks to me. Her presence has saved my life more than I care to admit. She once stopped my car on an old, curvy country road and told me to slow down and stay as far to the right as possible. As I rounded the next curve, there was a log truck speeding toward me, and I swerved to my right and just barely escaped being hit head-on.

"This sounds more like spirits being forced to relive part of their lives (possibly the final moments, especially in the case of the boy). You couldn't interact with anything, which is probably for the best, or you might not be sharing this story with us. It may also mean that there's not as much to worry about as you originally thought.

However, even if these spirits can't/won't cause harm to any of the boys who end up at this house, that doesn't mean the boys can't dig something up. There could be things buried or hidden in the remains of that church waiting for someone stupid or malicious enough to open the door for them.

My advice would be to talk to the realtor and see if they know anything. Tell them you saw spirits in the church he said was destroyed. He may be able to point you in the right direction to get things resolved, since he knows so many locals (and presumably the local folklore, too). If he can't/won't help you, and you can't find someone that can get rid of the spirits, your boss may need to implement a list of rules the boys need to follow if they stay at the house.

Which hopefully won't lead to a new post here in a year or two: ""I just got taken off the streets by a local non-profit. The house they put me in has a list of rules, and I should have followed them.""",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVmem5MVXlOWjRESnQ0REZldWNzTV96S191SkkxdXJUVVU0ZkhHTDVTSDYtZVVOVkg3cG9nQlJjWDd2NWFwS2hWLWFURUxjS0pDUk5oeTZVWC04Qkl5YlE9PQ==

The bigger concern is the possibility of a demon.

The good news is that it seems to be underground.

Go back to the spot in the daylight.  Try and find the hatch.  DON'T OPEN IT.

Seal it with cement, block it up.

Or pour some soil over it, plant a tree or two over it and hope they seal it closed with roots.

If you can't find the hatch, fence off the spot, make up a story.

"Yes, but the human mind goes funny in much less time than that. Lack of human interaction for just a few days produces measurable decreases in language processing skills, and for extended periods, the psyche breaks down. There are awful stories in history of people kept locked up in isolation for decades, and they all became at best supremely mentally unstable, incapable of prolonged logical thought. Reading a book and understanding it would be impossible.

You have someone wander a dark labyrinth for centuries or millennia, and you'll end up with someone who has forgotten how to read, cannot communicate, and is little more than a machine driven by their basest instincts.

And that's assuming they even last that long. It's for the cruel and the malicious, after all. If they met another person, there's a much higher-than-average chance that it would end in the death of one or both. And the story makes it clear that you absolutely can die there, unless the god from the machine decided to reverse it later.

Time is not the limiting factor. The fragility and perishability of the human mental condition is.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVnN1dxbm8tV0VKcm1NNjAyVjZkalVsWGpjTFh4bnhoMTZXSldZQkdPWEdWcnhPajlQX21CVXRnM25qSmZ1QkNIVTRwNzh1dGVYNzFsOEJMWDJVU1p2RWc9PQ==

"He claimed to have built the place. And, he was able to resurrect the dead. Since this story is somewhat biblical, it seems he was god. In Abrahamic traditions, god created hell in order to punish people, and only god was able to resurrect people (like the story of Jesus and Lazarus).

But this is clearly not exactly the god described in the Bible. That god states clearly that anyone who sees him directly would die. Our main character sees him, and lives, although there is clear damage--whether this is from seeing god or from all the other stuff is impossible to know. God in the Bible also states that he is omnipotent, and yet the god in this story is unable to restore the broken minds of the team, and unable to stop them entering except by leaving vague clues. So it seems that the main character met god, but our ideas of god are incorrect, possibly distorted over time and through ignorance. Maybe he's one of many such gods, each overseeing a different part of hell and other such places. He certainly seems more like some Eldritch horror than anything else, to have created such a place at all and then abandoned it so indifferently to the souls who remain inside.

God does appear as an elderly man in robes, which is in keeping with common Christian depictions. And, in a perversion of the multiple stories of Jesus healing the blind and restoring their sight, this god takes away someone's eyes entirely, as punishment for being unable to endure a terror beyond humans' ability to endure.

I'm pretty sure the architect was god, but god kind of sucks, and is part of a system that we know very little about and are better off staying far away from.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVncWVYMHpfeEhuenBOUFl3QUpqUlp6alBodDl3Mzhhc2k4ZzV0REhLbnh2Y2xGV2xqTDJ6RGhTTU1JV2RjN2tGblJ3bi1Kd1lvWXlIUGVHNzktMUlvdHc9PQ==

If Toby is the only one still himself, then you could try talking to him honestly, I think Toby is a victim as much as anyone else here. This is something your sister has done, but I still can not see any benefit to pretending that her and Toby are a genuine couple.  There has got to be a bigger picture as it is not worth all this effort just to make it look like they are in love.

"i’m tempted to say bring a mirror, a vampire wouldn’t show up in one but a not-vampire may mistake its own reflection for prey in the heat of the moment. the cover of dark may be the poor girl’s only safety, but when you open that door some light filters through. at the very least it could give you a few much needed seconds of distraction. if not a mirror, bring a ball or a stone. without light to see, the thing may hunt by sound. toss the object in the opposite direction and it may go for that instead of you.

tread lightly, jack. 

and if anyone says to use garlic as a ward, that could get you killed. you’d be a stinky beacon. wash yourself in a neutral soap, like the type hunters use to mask their scent. you’ll want every advantage you can take to throw this creature off your trail and distract it from sophie.

i’m wracking my brain for any further advice i can give. see, my go-to protection herbal blend may not work in your favor here, so im hesitant to recommend anything of that sort. herbs could just attract it to you, we don’t know what exactly you’re dealing with and i’d hate to recommend a blend that’ll make you a sitting duck. vampiric adjacent entities aren’t my specialty, i do apologize. i’ll check in with my coven’s records and see if there’s anything further that could help.

"haha, the garlic smell will stick to you. a stainless steel fish (or sink) can help rub off the stink.

birdseed, multiple uses there. think pocketsand, right? could throw it in the eyes, abrasive and startling. could throw the opposite direction from you, the loud sound of scattering will distract the beast. alternatively, if you *are* dealing with a vampire, it’ll be compelled to stop whatever it’s doing to stop and count every one. like grains of rice (also a good alternative, but i hate wasting food).

my go-to blend is boneset, lemongrass, mint, sage, feverfew, bay leaves, and star anise. if i’ve got some oils on hand, i’ll infuse them with jinx killer, protective fire, and fear no evil.

the herbal blend can be used as a tea, steeped in hot oil until it cools to anoint, used as a floor wash, in your laundry, burnt as incense, or mixed into candle wax. if you’re ever in need, dm me and i’ll have some sent your way.

but again, the scent can be mighty powerful. and if whatever you’re up against isn’t warded off, it’ll be drawn right to you and your trail. this works best against spirits, nonphysical entities. but some corporeal beings are repelled by it. mind you, this ain’t a cure for possession, but it can lower an entity’s hold on the victim if consumed. not an easy task, as i’m sure you can imagine. gives the victim a fighting chance, at the very least, if they don’t choke. my coven’s had some luck with dispelling rather unusual hauntings, and we regularly ward ourselves and our dwellings this way. smells damn good, if nothing else.

oh, and before i forget? you can grind it into salt. strengthens your protection that way. i tend to keep herbal salts on hand just in case, given how versatile salt is against the supernatural. salt itself is a must-have in your kit, i make a habit of snagging salt packets from any restaurant that has any. my glove box? stocked.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVpSHd6OUYwY1J4WWJvV2VLR0Z5OHlrQ1d0a3JjY0xmZDNvTEo4Q0Q2a3VDX1BLNzFtaUY3ckZ6RVlnSVMxTEhRcFlYZWoxRWl4UHBDdDE3cVpNeEJ0Mmc5dXpZelZ2Z000N2poRGlJc294RzQ9

When that disrespectful idiot child decided to maim the Hawthorne tree and carve his and her names into its branch, you said he ended up calling Victor for help

A banjo?
And Victor described that creature as “something that was once considered a god and has not forgotten”.
Iolo is incomprehensibly old to something as short-lived as a human.
Think of how many hundreds of years it may have been since someone heard him play *that* song and not end up a victim.

"I believe the micrites are slowly transforming the doll. Soon enough Yss will appear to be fully human. She may even be able to properly emulate eating just for the sake of public normalcy. They must use the dolls because those are the closest inanimate objects to humans, making them the quickest and most energy efficient to transform.


I knew a young woman in college who worked at a thrift store once that I went to all the time. Some of the stuff sold was clothes, and there were a few mannequins in that part of the store, not white ones but regular peachy-skin color.


She seemed a little off to me because she liked them so much. She confided in me once that she had a crush on one of them, and I just thought she was being weird. She said she wished the woman was real so she could be with her. To her the mannequin's name was Sarabeth. To me, the mannequin's name is Literally A Fucking Mannequin.


Last time I ever went there, both she and the mannequin were gone. I asked the manager about her curiously, and he smirked and said he'd fired her after finding out she was a psycho.

"My marriage to my husband only lasted a little over twelve years. We were both single parents. He died of cancer. I could be bitter or whatever, but I am so grateful that I got to have time with him at all. When I miss him so much my heart’s broken halves feel like they are shriveling like a bad banana peel in the sun, I remind myself that I am grateful for the time I got, rather than sad for the time I wished for.

"I strongly believe in things like this. 

There was a time when My uncle died off alcoholism. He was out on life support, eventually pulling the plug. Before he died he told my mother ""when I die I will come back to scare you."" She told me this an I thought nothing of it . 

My step father was very devastated for a couple months . After a few years I guess my mother went to the cemetery with my dad and my mom found an ornament that belong to someone that was deceased. (I did not know of this at the time.) 

I remember going to bed like everyone else and I went into a deep sleep. All of a sudden I felt something shaking so I opened my eyes super quick and looked around without getting up. I thought I was trippin for a minute (I was 13yrs old at the time) I instantly thought it was an earthquake.

I layed in bed with my eyes open for a while and I looked over at my brothers and wondered if my mother felt it to, so I waited for her to come into my room to see if we were okay. She never came. So I closed my eyes hoping to fall asleep again after being startled . 

I shit you not I felt someone kick the hell out of my bed twice causing me to shake and open my eyes really quick, I didn't see anyone but my brothers sleeping. You even heard the kick on the leg of my bed. Obviously I was terrified and I got up off my bed and hopped right into my little brother bed and hugged him in terror, looking around wondering what the hell just happened . 

I forgot about it eventually the next day but it happened again and again I couldnt take it anymore !!!  Took 3 days for me to finally go to my mom and hoped that she believed me when I told her someone was kicking my bed. So I go into her room an I told her ""mom I know this may sound insane but someone is kicking my bed at night and it doesn't kick my brothers bed when I go sleep w him, I'm scared to sleep there tonight"" 

She said ""oh, that's weird, when your dad gets up out of bed and goes to work at 5 in the morning he leaves and Im in the room and the same thing happens to me. I think I'll go an take the ornament back to the original grave  or I'll ask grandma what I should do, it might be your uncle."" I said ""what, why are you taking stuff that doesn't belong to you especially from a grave, your crazy!"" 

She ended up taking this ornament and putting it back. All the problems went away and it never happens again . (My grams now lives in that house. That's not the only time something strange went down .",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGV6aW5RMURLZVJfOUVCNkY0QjFkd1M5MWlKU0lKemgxdzJacndXLVBjTnQ0aTdnZUhjbkx5b2p4VDlzQUd3bWh2VTBYSi1ZckJzamN6NkxpMFhydmJpVkE9PQ==

"Yeah the knife and pepper spray were really more to give myself some peace of mind, and to just have *something* to defend myself with if I had to. Although I was thinking more along the lines of using it to, god forbid, defend against another person. Like I said, I doubt they'd do me any good against a large animal, I probably should have got some bear spray instead especially since I just heard recent reports of bears in NH going up to campsites looking for food and not really fearing people. There actually was a fireplace poker there to use for the fire, which I did, but I was considering using it as a weapon if I needed to. I didn't keep it though, since it wasn't mine.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGUwdFZ5aDFIUDlJdkVTN0lISUZoY2lYbnFEQmhJZV9IMjh0YkZ4MnVkU3ZZV0IwM1B2aW9KMXFUY3JIWE1WWFdPb3Vjb1hEdnVNakRQRktuQWFfSjBVYmc9PQ==

Highly recommend this great ""tough guy"" noir: a similarly caustic, witty main character with terrible luck that you cannot help rooting for.

"I wonder if there's others like him? I used to go to a local pub in my old town that had a specific waitress who never actually seemed to be serving anyone. If a customer seemed to need help, they wouldn't call to her, they would call to other servers as if she wasn't there. She would never stop to take orders or even give a refill, she'd just be cleaning or doing anything else that didn't require customer interaction. Never heard her speak.


But once I did see her stop at a table with just one lone young woman sitting there, and offer to refill her soda. Perfectly normal voice, nothing weird. Woman thanked her, waitress took the empty glass and went to the back. Came back again with a full glass. Nothing odd about it.


Two days later I went there and found cop cars everywhere. Place was under investigation. Closing down, from the look of it. They waved me off when I tried to ask questions from my car.


But I managed to gather that a local woman had recently gone missing. Last seen at the pub two days ago. I didn't hear a description. Don't know if it was the same woman.


The pub didn't close after all, but I stayed away.


Hey. Maybe the waitress was the weirdo man's offspring. Like father, like daughter.


You can't call the game. It goes on forever. Your best bet is to just leave the bleachers and walk away.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGUwSjZHOHNVQnQ0elgwVGJEWEpBR2ZCa2d5TnU1ZWlaU0phSWZvYTFoQWVoMDR0b20yZ3l3UEdTZzJXbWR6M3FHSFhPUHNhMFkweEtrWkFXZHFvRmg5d0E9PQ==

"Continued: “Caelan! Caelan! Where are you?”

“It’s really nice out here tonight. Come a little further, Zack!” a female voice called to my left.

“You can’t save him, Zack! You couldn’t even save me!” a more distorted voice called to my left.

“Bring me my goddamn dog back! It should have been my son,” an even more distorted voice snarled. I couldn’t tell where that voice came from. This voice was more menacing and echoed even deeper into the waves.

 When the voices ceased, something snarled from beneath the water followed by high-pitched, muffled screams. I forced myself down under. My eyes didn’t adjust to the darkness but there was just enough light to see black sludge permeating the water above and below me.The sludge stung my eyes. I closed them and forced myself further below. The high-pitched scream grew more audible. My eyes opened in front of Caelan who slipped in and out of consciousness as the sludge permeated his body. I couldn’t see beneath the sludge but I reached out to grab Caelan from the rubbery and scaly entity constricting his body. Surprisingly, his body slipped from the entity and I pulled him above the surface.

He opened his eyes and we both were coughing profusely. Caelean forced himself out of my arms and hiccupped a mouth full of water. 

“Are you okay, Caelan?”

“You shouldn’t have done that!” Caelan yelled. His eyes morphed from blue to a darker shade.

“You were drowning!”

“You can try all you want but it’ll always be the same…” 

“What…what do you mean? We have to get back…”

Before I could say anything more, I heard another snarl from beneath the water. The rubbery and scaly entity emerged from the water, taking the form of an enormous, twisting black tail. The tail swept over the waves, colliding with my body, its ivory scales puncturing my chest. My body propelled backward, dangling helplessly as it skirted over the now still rapids. The speed felt like being on an upside down roller coaster without any straps or supports. I couldn’t scream. I couldn’t move as my body blew backward over the shore and onto the grassy knoll. Upon my body’s impact, I slipped into darkness.

When I awoke from my trance-like state, the sun beamed through my eyes. For some reason, I felt stiff without any excruciating pain. My arms and legs moved without peril. I rose to my feet and touched my chest, surprised to see my shirt back on and my cell phone in my pocket. Had I dreamt the night before? At that moment, Darius' power of suggestion and hallucination explanation seemed more logical, even though I couldn’t quite make sense of it. If a giant serpent actually attacked me and my body impacted the knoll at roller coaster speed, I would have been killed upon impact. I also hadn’t slept well the previous night and probably collapsed upon the knoll, dreaming up my nightmarish encounter with Caelan and the serpent.

 It was all beginning to make sense, or at least I thought it did. The three of us came to the river with our deeply buried trauma and after hearing the story of the river serpent, we saw and heard what we wanted to. People hallucinated ghosts and demons for all sorts of strange reasons. I couldn’t explain the psychology behind it but figured this was the most satisfying explanation for the previous day's events. When I checked my phone, I found a number of missing calls from Jordan. With all the chaos from the previous day, I almost forgot he was my roommate. I texted the guys that I was okay and that I accidentally fell asleep in the park.

As I finished the texts, I looked up to see Matty knee deep in the morning tide. I rubbed my eyes to make sure I wasn’t hallucinating again.

“Matty!” I shouted with glee. “You’re a sight for sore eyes. What are you doing out here?”

I expected to hear Matty’s gleeful voice but upon reaching him, he responded with a sense of sorrow.  “I came out here hoping to see my poor mac-min or nighean. The serpent only lets  you see what he wants.”

“I didn’t realize both of them died. Matty, I’m so sorry.”

He sighed. “Caelan drowned looking for the serpent. Irene passed shortly after…probably of a broken heart.”

My heart was exploding in my chest. My entire body felt nauseous. I excused myself and rushed up the knoll and projectile vomited black sludge onto the grass. Another scale floated upward like a submerged shark fin. After my body felt empty and lifeless, I blinked and there was nothing there but tall grass and in the distance, the sound of the cruel morning waves.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGUxN0FIdGRZQnRocUlYczc1bC1hajVJNXFqRVI3RWxZRkN2REx1QnVESDBpa3htV2ptbFJ3M0UyVVJOR1hxZmxuRXdxNzlvam1OcVV4NUdBdzI2R25SNXc9PQ==

">Abdul who seems chill. I wonder how he met you or Jack

I actually never met Abdul before the Milwaukee murder house. Lucas introduced him. Ever since Harmony Care Home, Lucas has been lowkey obsessed with the paranormal, and I guess Abdul is one of the guys he met on some sort of cryptid hunt.

>I’m so glad he stopped being so STUBBORN when it’s clear the both of you are meant for each other

THANK YOU! He can be really exasperating but at least he admits when I'm right (which is usually). We are doing really well right now! I've been encouraging him to study for his GED.

Emma here, THANK YOU, Jack won't stop telling people about my ""seduction"" of him that night. I had to tell him he won't get ""seduced"" any future nights if he keeps it up! 

And yes, I'm still working on figuring out how to deal with the Lady in red. Jack made me promise that if she ever shows up for him again, I can't be involved.

"Her wife is controlling and Val is possibly abused and gaslighted. It's on the verge of being obvious, something is up, it almost makes me wanna shake some sense into OP.  


 You can totally pick up your baby after C-section, you just can't pick them up in a carrier or pick up an older child. That was red flag number one. Then whisking her off to the hospital, after one minor incident. Legally I believe(just looked it up on a lawyer website), for lesbian couples the parent not giving birth has to file a step-parent adoption. That probably takes a longer than a week to finalize so Aaliyah isn't legally mom yet. But now she's gotten Val out of the picture. It's suspicious for sure. 


Maybe Val is really losing it but not allowing her to hold the baby and locking her up after one incident where she didn't even threaten harm is way too much controlling. I would think she had nightmare if that had been the only incident. ",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZGZlIyOEI3d0NuaS1sSXVOY0RoZlZjMHJYclFwTG5SRDd0RmxMdDM1cTc2cjdVV2o1V1JQRVBueEZpbl9oTTNVZ1dnZ0o3cHRPZEs5b1FmXzl0eHdla1E9PQ==

"Bro, this might just sound as insane as what you're experiencing. But I think that being that's haunting you might be a Fetch. Fetches are basically doppelgangers that try to replace you. They start out with little things like your keychain or your airpods. As they grow stronger the objects they duplicate become bigger and they might even start to impersonate humans. The fact that you saw your roommates fetch means that it's already pretty strong. If it continues to get more powerful it will start erasing you slowly, starting with your memories. That's why you need to write EVERYTHING down.
I'm glad you already left your apartment, don't go back there it's to dangerous, your roommate is probably lost at this point if he wasn't gone already. Don't go back to your routines, switch locations randomly, always keep something made of iron with you, preferably a knife. It might buy you some valuable time if you have to face the Fetch.

I, however, have an allergy to iron so I need to use gloves a lot! Even when working the grill or the smoker! (I get blisters on my hands)

I’m curious how lolo was able to check that it was undamaged, especially since he is inhuman! How did he pick it up?

"Yeah, he seems like a total ass! Looks like he has a similar allergy to me then! I need gloves with my steel sword…. It would be silly not to with how these men fight in re-enactment! Let alone the blistering and allergies from them! The hilt itself from mine is pure steel, so if my wrist touches it, I break out. itch for a few days, then I’m ok, iron though? It’s like I’ve touched a hot pan that I’ve left the handle on the fire for too long!

Wielding a sword takes some skill… also muscles if you’re not used to it! My preferred weapon is the 2-handed spear (which, consequently, mine is made of wrought iron!) so a nice ash shaft with a lot of training I can wield it nicely and even shorten it for close combat!!! 

It also helps for leg swiping too!!!!!! It really comes in handy if you have an inhuman BARGE INTO YOUR HOME! (It happens to me more than I would like to be fair… but meh, shit happens…perhaps I’ll post my tales of woes and events at some point.)

"I don’t know your baby was replaced by a demon but I also don’t know about jumping to a postpartum psychosis diagnosis either. 

Maybe the freckle was actually something else like a speck of dried fluid? You could also have had a terrible nightmare due to the stress of all the changes around. 

Do you have any bruising or scabbing around your nipple that was bitten? Have a doc evaluate the wound?

Take advantage of being at the hospital and speak with the psychologist about postpartum psychosis and the symptoms. IF you feel like you’re truly not having a mental health crisis, it also wouldn’t hurt to have labs drawn incase you’re being drugged.

Treat the baby kindly, no matter what you think it is. Best case scenario is that this is your baby. Do you know who the donor was? There’s a chance your baby could have some unique…parentage that’s making her change physical features.

Then again, if it is a changeling, treating it badly may put your own baby at risk. You can look up info on changelings and see if you are able to trade the fae back for your baby.

I don’t know what to think of your wife but she sounds controlling. There could be a connection there too so play it safe when you get home. I don’t like how quick she was to have you committed.

It's such a strange turn that he wants to make you a hero and train you with an iron fae-sword, when he could have done anything to you with your hagstone gone and you so vulnerable. I think he has a little more than just respect for you, there's something like affection there. As much as a neighbour can have affection for another.          
He definitely sees you as a chess piece though, he has designs on you, for what is yet to be seen. If you could find a seer to help you find out exactly what he wants from you, it would be very helpful.             
I just hope that you can retain as much humanity as possible, throughout Iolo's immortality process. 

I also think you should name the sword Fae-kill. Give him as much cheek as you can at all times.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZQN244TzFhRk14eTVQTHRnc2VfX2Z6SUxuN1RHamtKdzBBT2x6SnZXNTZUQm9HbU1lUU9DdVpTNlBzbkVjckRhNFpxUkFkUHNhSkFUZkhJTTUwYnQ1QUE9PQ==

"“Nate was right, by the time we got back to camp, *the sun had completed its daily rotation* and plunged us into darkness.”

While the sun does have an axis upon which it rotates, it actually takes a little less (about 27-28 days) than a month for it to complete a rotation.  The sun’s rotation on its axis does not cause us to have days and nights.

Earth, however, ALSO has an axis upon which it rotates. One full rotation takes approximately 24 hours and is the physics phenomenon responsible for our planet having days and nights.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZQem9XdTlQblA5RWd6RUhNSmkzSTZRQUdHblRHdVExTnUtYkxyLUFhNlk0a0ZmQjB3RHl5aU9SNzQwN3BZaUU3MjZRZDY2bEpBVzduVTVBRTZmSm4wcEZldWFGcS1reVFBVUNrdE1KRm9ZdUk9

"Thank you for your comment. It's been a rough few days here, and I only get to use the internet sparingly, when everyone is asleep and the guards are less on my ass.

To answer your questions: I don't think the freckle was something else. I don't know how to describe it without sounding like an idiot, but it was definitely freckle-like in quality. I do not have anything left on the skin that was bitten. A lot of people have questioned how the blood/bite/bruise could be gone when Aaliyah walked in the room - I have no idea. I'm just as confused as you are. 

They do think I'm suffering with some sort of psychosis, though apparently it takes more than one session to diagnose someone. I had labs drawn when I arrived to see if I'm on drugs, and they said it was clean.

We don't know who the donor was. He was an anonymous donor at a clinic. All I can tell you is that whatever attacked me that night is not my baby. Call is observant or mother's intuition or lunacy, but I know it was not. I don't want to hurt my baby though, of course, so I'll play it safe until I can get my own baby back. A few people have suggested changelings, so I'll have to do some research whenever I can.

As for my wife: a lot of people don't get good vibes from Aaliyah. I understand this story probably didn't paint her in the best of light, but I love my wife and she's a great woman. She's the kind of person who would move snails out of the road so they don't get run over. She has saved multiple babies/children/adults from choking in restaurants. She once aided in a medical emergency on a plane. I think she's just worried, overtired and overworked, and trying her best. She's a woman of science, and has never really believed in anything supernatural, despite her family being devoutly baptist. Hell, if your wife came to you with this shit, wouldn't you think she was crazy too?

I'll find some way to get Aaliyah to believe me, and then I'll get my baby back. Thank you all for your suggestions.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZQaEFMbzFIbTF6anQ5VE9wc1BRa09FWE5MVWRtNDcwOWVDc0VzUXhBM3VqdmRhUDNvMTg1aUl1T3V2M0d5Vm93bkpOM1ExREw0Sk9xMG1Dc19rNEFnSnc9PQ==

"I don't think so.  It’s happened while I’ve been laying down, crouching, standing, or walking.  The eye’s been tracking me since I caught its deception.  However, its mainly happened while I’ve been in my kitchen.  The only other place it’s happened was the hotel.  Ever since that incident, I've just been too scared to risk seeing what happens if I try leaving my home again.  Though, things have changed now.  Thinking about your questions made me realize that the horrific fate that likely awaits me in the gruesome not-office is far worse than the risk of some unknown hazard if I try running again.  I can’t afford to be constantly on the move forever, but fleeing tonight should buy me some time to find a more permanent solution.  Hopefully they won’t catch up to me too quickly. ",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZRRXYzVWlHQVhaRnBqWmdsdVc4eVJqRG14VlhJLW8tLXdfRnpWak4xcmtMOVFHVnJYY1lJTmV3RURTY0taVjBSTmxBcVNUazFUTFFnYnI4UkJoT1NXYUE9PQ==

"I had a friend that was convinced, that dish soap was the answer to removing fat from a body, since it dissolves fat and grease on dishes. She replaced her shampoo and body wash with dish soap.

She actually lost weight after a couple of months, but I am pretty sure it was because she got a dog and walked him 2 hours a day, and not because of the dish soap.

"Hi! 

A simple solution to this would be as follows, unless there's some information out there that says otherwise. It seems that two conditions have to be met to see the woman:
1. It has to be through glass
2. You have to see her with your eyes

The person that died on the fourth day by seeing her may have been pure coincidence, unless there's been multiple occurrences with people dying on that day. The best bet of surviving is blindfolding yourself and reaching authorities or a hospital for help. The blindfold will stop you from seeing her through windows and glass. But if that doesn't help and she inevitably kills you regardless of whether you see her in the glass or not, try everything you can to record the encounter and fight back. Maybe one thing will work and help the next person searching for answers.

Good luck!

Edit: Maybe not recording, but I'm sure as long as you're blindfolded and don't look through the lens of the camera you'll have a chance. Or record audio!",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZST3hmNml2OVJpYWRLQlJKRkdTSDF2V3RRZG12WkRnTlZUM3R4NTBMcnB0NjlqZFBxV1g1QlFDU2VmcFRUNnlzUDg5cE5pbkpLSnZwYzMxbFhYMzd1S1E9PQ==

"Hi! Mental health professional here. I want to address the comments regarding mental health and medication. I saw the theory that this person could be experiencing psychosis, but the writing is easily followed. There is some tangential thinking but brought back on track easily. That’s not to say that these aren’t hallucinations. You can have hallucinations and not be in psychosis. For anyone experiencing symptoms, it’s recommended to get a full physical health work up and then see a therapist. Our bodies are complicated and sometimes our physical health messes with our mental health or vice versa. This is not medical advise and is based on years of professional experience. Please don’t recommend people get on medication when you’re not their provider. Hope this provides some insight!!

OP, I hope you’re doing okay. It doesn’t matter if no one else thinks this is real. What matters is that it’s real to you and causing real psychological pain. It may be worth learning reality-checking techniques (type of coping skills) to help you find what can be seen by others and what’s seen by just you. Listen to your body. Reach out to people you trust.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZSTURaMkZ4MUVPVGJrTlotYzhlQVhTb0JpcGROX3JFVVRsdHFEMmthUXl1WDFNdmtESEJnMWdxMkVJQkUtdkE1OFFVVGlCc1F1RnMwUTZwMXExOEQyM0E9PQ==

"Is it bad that this whole time I kept thinking ""these people shouldn't have pets""? You shouldn't feed a snake live prey, and they're kinda... stupid enough that you shouldn't have to. If they don't get the mouse/rat right away, there's a good chance it will come back and try to fight it. Then you have an injured, maybe even killed snake on your hands. And rats are social and SMART. They need companionship and enrichment. And it sounds like they aren't keeping its cage clean enough.

Too bad even if you bring it up, they probably won't care. Snakes are exotic and too many people get them without reading up on care first, and rats are a ""throwaway"" pet.

"How were the nine kids so close growing up? It sounds like they were practically all the same age if they were all  helping with homework and fighting each other's bullies. But even with three dads, there is only one mom, who could carry one pregnancy at a time. It'd be different, of course, if it were one dad with three moms instead.

Are we to understand there were several multiple births and/or adoptions in the family? Or else perhaps some other sort of magic you kids were never told about?

Stay safe, OP!",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZiN1hRaF9ST3psUWhJODM3ZDZ1eEc2Tzg5bXNiUDhUN1ZpSmlPWE42UXdSSkdmYU03aXVGUmVGdTA3cjJ5SU5ZQldwLTI3MGVVd3JoNUpDby1pN0FqaEE9PQ==

"My heart hurts for people touched by war. Killing things is supposed to touch us. Killing our own should of course touch us more. 

My first deer I killed the bullet mushroomed when it glanced a rib, and there was no heart when we field dressed her. She had run a little more than 50 yards, and was trying to get up (damage to muscles along her shoulder made that impossible).  With NO HEARTBEAT.

"First of all:  Run.  Be safe.  Run.

Secondly, I don't know if this is connected but ... My ex, Michael, who lived with me previously, cheated on me a year and three months ago with a woman named Victoria. I kicked him out, but after he apologized profusely, I agreed he could return platonically until he saved enough to move out. He never came back. He left behind his expensive laptop, a safe full of cash and savings bonds, family heirlooms, his clothes, TV, a pet parrot (who told me about the affair that he confessed to). I couldn’t reach him.

About a week later, I missed a voicemail that was just him screaming painfully mixed with other screams. When I tried to call back, the phone was disconnected. Concerned, I called the police, but since we weren’t married, he was an adult, and we weren’t related, they refused to trace his phone. He’s been missing ever since.

I’m not sure if this is connected, but if you see him and his soul is screaming from a jar, tell him Lily is so sorry. And then run. Run faster than you ever have. If you need a place to stay for a few days, DM me. Please, just run.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZiazZHb0lId3VjWDNwV2gwMUlVZXBhaXJEWC1rbW9BaTY1YWt3dU56cnZNYWZJampYNXRtVXhWYVdpcjNKSVVkWUlnQkd3aW05bmNOVDJ6LW9zZnRjQnc9PQ==

"I reported it all to the local police station as I quickly booked the fuck out of there after seeing what I saw. The police station was only a 5 minute drive away and I gave them all of the information, including the vans color and company which I forgot to mention in the story, Mercedes Benz. So sorry for not mentioning that part. I told them about the man being in the parking garage by my work and that same day after I told them, the man and the van were missing, which is not surprising. But the only thing that was found at the site was the two decapitated heads with a letter right beside them. The letter on it said these three words, “I love pigeon.” Sadly the two victims heads were the ones who were reported being missing on the news and they were murdered. I ran into the same story of the missing victims by simply just going to work. The man to this day has never been found and in my area we now refer to him as the “Pigeon Killer.” I didnt want my story to get attention in the area by creating some sort of urban legend or whatever, but that has already happened.

"I’m fairly certain that “Joseph”, who seems to be able to change in appearance, really did Adeline’s husband that night, and took his place. I think the whole suburban street was just a product of his design- a spiderweb- to lure a new woman into his grasp. I mean, why is he the only one that has a name? Or some semblance of a life outside of family. His original wife was undoubtedly a victim of something. She had no name, no record, and was little more than an incubator. Maybe she was somebody beforehand, before she became Joseph’s victim, and maybe she was charmed into fully forgetting life outside of this sick influence he had over her. Could explain why she started losing her nerve after Adeline showed up and she was exposed to the outside world again.

"All you see is hotels. For example, I used to work in a retail job that required a lot of travel. We sponsored certain sports and would send managers when there were games to pass out merch and stuff. Sounds cool right? Here was my visit to San Francisco.


4 pm - catch flight to San Francisco

8 pm - arrive at the hotel and check in

8:30 - Head to dinner at the restaurant in the hotel with my bosses and colleagues.

11 - Finally go to the room to sleep.


6 am - Breakfast

7 am - head to a nearby store warehouse to pick up the stuff for the game.

8 am - Organize the warehouse because everything is impossible to find. 

12 pm - catch lunch with team.

2 pm - head to the game early to set up.

4 pm - game starts, pass out merch.

9 pm - head back to the hotel room. ""Dinner"" was a hotdog or something at the game.


6 am - get in the taxi to the airport.


Keep in mind, my job allowed for a lot of extra time compared to some of the other jobs I've traveled with. Most jobs you would leave the game and go straight to the airport to leave. If I wanted to, I could ask for a trip extension. An extra day or two in the city to see it. They won't cover the hotel or anything, but your plane ticket is paid for. I never did it because $$$ and I was so exhausted after the trips I just wanted to go home.

"So, a Kickapoo tribesman and you're aunt, followed  by a fox, an owl, and a giant hound (for lack of a better term), as well as what appears to be a bone from a rabbit.

Only two of these are dream manifestations. The rest are ""real-world"" signs (if that makes sense).

The meaning of the animals, as well as the order they appear, probably have different meanings to different Natives, and may even be open to interpretation, with the animals representing keywords that are of value. 

Just guessing here, but you are being encouraged to embrace your heritage. The fox usually represents cunning and intellect, the owl depicts wisdom, and the hound...  either looking for it's pack, or lost and trying to find its way home.

"Well I'm not very familiar with the Astral Projection but I think I may have some ideas as to how to fix things and bring your family back.

1. Eliminate Toby: In truth I kinda feel bad for the guy and I'd rather he didn't die. Sadly this may be the only way. It would make sense that these copies which control your family would also die since they should be connected.
2. Negotiate with the copies: This might sound a little crazy but hear me out. From what you said so far I don't have the impressions that thee copies are evil, just desperate. I think they could be reasoned with.

First of all, clearly they don't like taking over people. Your ""sister"" tried to not take over your mother until she couldn't hide anymore. Your ""mom"" then did the same thing with your dad. Initially tried to avoid the topic by offering sex but when that didn't work she took over him. So it seems it's not their wish to take control over people. They are just desperate

Second, these copies are technically Toby. This means that these copies may also love you as well. It sounds weird but hear me out first. We know Toby has feeling for you, so these copies may harbor some form of feelings for you as well. Your ""mom"" said they didn't take over your body to keep Toby from ending himself. But what stopped them from taking over you? The fake you could have simply pretended to be the real you to Toby and that's it. Maybe they didn't want to take the risk. Or maybe they didn't do it because they care for you. But then why did they threaten you? Well as I said they are afraid so they will do what them deem necessary. One thing is to threaten and another to actually do it. When they came that night to your room I believe they did it to put the fear of God in you. Similar with harming you now in front of Toby. And even if I'm wrong, they can't get rid of you because you are their trump card. If they do then there is nothing stopping Toby from ending himself.

So maybe there is a way for you to negotiate with them and find a way for them to be happy and your family to be brought back. You could ask them what exactly happened to your parents and sister. Granted they could lie here and say that their dead so you would lose hope and abandon any change at getting them back, when in reality your family are either stuck in their own bodies, unable to take control, or they are now in the Astral Projection with no way to return to their bodies.

The downside is that I don't see much way for you to agree on. You want your family back, as we do, while the copies want to remain. So there doesn't seem to be a way for you to make a deal anyone will be happy with.

3. Enter the Astral Projection yourself: This might be a bit to fantasy or wishful thinking but it is also the best outcome, in my opinion. If you and Toby enter together then you could find the copies and fight them and maybe end them, without harming your family bodies. Moreover, there is a change you will also find your family's souls here, hence the 5 of you cand defeat the three copies.

Personally I would try option 2 first and then 3. Taking option 2 first may allow you to learn more about these copies and potential weaknesses. In this way you could better prepare for option 3 if it will be needed (and I suspect it will).

Some people suggested that you seek help from someone else but I disagree. While I did say that the copies don't seem to like taking over people, they will do it if necessary. If you bring another person then said person will be controlled and you will have to deal with more then 3 copies.

I hope this helps and you will manage to bring your family back!",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZtZXFrTVAzSXYtWUZxZ1NBY2FLMDZGZkJuaEg3S3g0NndKRjdCNmZHRE9Wdlc1T0ZtSG0yTHRwS3J0NzVpY0JvSDVZV1ZfY1h6c29WZDEzRUI2TndGdGc9PQ==

"Bahahaha! Nessa, we’re gaining in numbers. I may be in lockdown solitary confinement, but we’re still luring others in. 

Now, enough of the tomfoolery. That last lunge at Iolo was not strategized, it was sloppy. Was it ego? Or frustration…? It’s interesting, because you have developed a comfortability around the mechanic that you could most easily say is not afforded to any other human. 

I’m just curious what his end game is. Obviously he’s already looked into your grand dad’s situation & knows that he’s related to you. Perhaps it was an assumption, but something else tells me that’s not really the case. He uses kid gloves with you…and it’s buggin the shit outta me. 

It’s almost like the answer is just outside fingers reach…if I could focus and pinpoint the energy for one more try, I could reach it. It’s itching the back of my mind.

"Got AI to write one about my husband and I :)

**Title: The House on Willow Lane**

—

Tom and I have been married for seven years, and we’ve known each other for fifteen. Our life together has been comfortable, predictable even, in all the best ways. Tom has always been devoted to me, and while he’s not the type to finish projects around the house, I’ve always appreciated his unwavering love. I’ve often joked that he couldn’t be more perfect, even with his little quirks.

We recently moved into an old house on Willow Lane. It was the kind of place that people either fall in love with or find unsettling. I was in the former category, charmed by its creaky floors and ivy-covered walls. Tom, on the other hand, seemed hesitant. He never said anything outright, but I could tell he was uneasy, especially about the attic.

The attic had been locked when we bought the house, with the previous owner simply saying, “It’s best left alone.” But I was curious. I imagined it full of forgotten treasures, dusty antiques, and old family heirlooms. Tom, though, seemed to have an unspoken aversion to it. He’d always change the subject when I brought it up.

One night, after Tom had gone to bed, I decided to explore the attic on my own. I found the key hidden in a drawer in the study—a large, old-fashioned thing, heavy in my hand. The door creaked ominously as I unlocked it, and a chill ran down my spine as I pushed it open.

The attic was surprisingly bare, with just a few pieces of old furniture covered in white sheets. The air was thick with dust, and the single bulb hanging from the ceiling cast long, eerie shadows on the walls. I was about to turn back when I noticed something strange—a small door in the far corner, barely noticeable in the dim light.

Curiosity got the better of me, and I made my way over, my footsteps echoing in the empty space. The door was tiny, almost child-sized, with no handle or lock. I hesitated for a moment, then pushed it open with a creak.

Inside was a small, dark room. The only thing in it was a mirror, an old, ornate thing with a heavy wooden frame. It seemed out of place, almost too grand for such a small, hidden room. As I approached, I saw my reflection, but there was something off about it. The image was distorted, as if the glass were warped.

I reached out to touch the mirror, and as my fingers brushed the cold surface, I heard a voice behind me—Tom’s voice.

“Meghan, what are you doing up here?”

I spun around, my heart leaping into my throat. Tom was standing in the doorway, his face pale and drawn. “I—I wanted to see the attic,” I stammered, trying to steady my breathing.

His eyes flicked to the mirror, and a strange expression crossed his face—fear, anger, and something else I couldn’t quite place. “You shouldn’t be here,” he said quietly. “It’s not safe.”

“What do you mean?” I asked, confused. “It’s just an old mirror.”

Tom shook his head, his eyes never leaving the mirror. “We need to go downstairs, now.”

He took my hand and led me out of the attic, closing the door firmly behind us. That night, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong. Tom wouldn’t talk about what had happened, but I could see the fear in his eyes, the way he avoided the subject. 

Over the next few days, Tom grew increasingly distant. He was always distracted, his mind elsewhere. He’d wake up in the middle of the night, drenched in sweat, his eyes wild and unfocused. I’d try to comfort him, but he’d just shake his head, telling me everything was fine.

Then, one night, I woke up to find Tom wasn’t beside me. The house was silent, the kind of silence that presses in on you, heavy and oppressive. I called his name, but there was no answer.

Panic gripped me as I searched the house. Finally, I made my way to the attic, dreading what I might find. The door was ajar, and I could see a faint light coming from inside.

I found Tom standing in front of the mirror, staring into it with a look of utter terror on his face. “Tom?” I whispered, my voice shaking.

He didn’t respond. His reflection in the mirror was different—darker, twisted. It was smiling, a cold, cruel smile that didn’t belong to my Tom. I stepped closer, and that’s when I saw it—the reflection wasn’t just different; it was moving on its own.

I screamed, grabbing Tom and pulling him away from the mirror. The image in the glass seemed to ripple, as if something was trying to push through.

“Meghan, we have to leave,” Tom gasped, his voice hoarse. “It’s not safe here. The mirror… it’s trying to take me.”

We fled the house that night, leaving everything behind. Tom was never the same after that. He was quieter, more withdrawn, and no matter how much I asked, he refused to talk about what he’d seen in the mirror.

I’ve often wondered what would have happened if I hadn’t found him in time, if that twisted reflection had succeeded in taking him. But deep down, I know one thing for certain:

"I’m genuinely impressed by the depth and complexity of the narrative. Your skill in blending reality with illusion creates an enthralling reading experience, and your characters are vividly drawn.

However, as I immersed myself in the story, I found myself occasionally feeling a bit disoriented by some of the transitions. Perhaps refining these moments could enhance the overall flow and coherence. Additionally, while the intricate plot is engaging, there were instances where a bit more clarity might help in maintaining the reader's connection to the characters and their motivations.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY1QldMZ1BPQW5feDlXMlF1UWlYdXliWlVFSE5neW1sZTR3bzliZXN1eXhzblhNdk5MamU3MDZWa3VySG1waHU3TFFLa0dDTVYtY1dMLUlBSERQV3JURGNPZVJBaWZka3NJc2V4RDFJV0FjQkE9

"Perhaps use your (apparent) internet access to hire a nanny to come care for the ""children"".

When she (or he - let's not be old fashioned) arrives you can slip out and leave her ""in charge"".  Problem solved - plus you've given your new ""roommates"" a ""playmate"" to take your place.  And since I doubt her bank exists in your present environment, you'll never have to pay them.  Easy-peasy.

Before you give up, try putting on a blindfold before you leave your room. Walk in the direction that you think you came from, and just trail one hand along the wall.

"There are a handful of stepminding guides in the midwest, but there are a few considerations you need to take into account (apart from the obvious dangers I presented). There's a set minimum pricing of $2400/h, for example. Then there's availability. I've only met three guides apart from doctor Bogan, and these people are often very secretive. Raskian Identity Theory (RIT) is considered pseudoscience and esoteric nonsense, so most academics don't flaunt working with it openly.

What I did notice is that those who work with RIT usually keep a blue sunflower of some kind. A painting, a pin... something. I think it's a kind of icon, an insider thing to kinda signal to others that you're involved. So keep an eye out.

Are you SURE he is NOT a Jinn????!! Be mindful not to lie to this guy! Just in case! You should know yourself! The ‘Jinn’ can take many forms and most are born from fire! (Therefore, he can take it! But they also do kinda need to ‘feed’) ummm

Edit to add, the last vamp I (personally encountered) had a red and Green sheen to their eyes!

"Hi, regarding your tinnitus, for years I also had it aand ended up seeing a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner. I discovered that my tinnitus was actually caused by blocked eustachian tubes(basically nasal drainage tubes running down the back of your neck). 
When your tinnitus is present, push your head as far back as you can, if the level/volume momentarily increases or decreases it probably means blocked tubes. Also if you push with your fingers on the back of your neck, on either side of the spine and feel mild pain then that's another indicator. 
Finally if you breathe int through your nose forcefully, like your clearing it a couple of times and the volume decreases for awhile then you're in luck!  Hot showers focusing the water on the back of your neck while massaging it can help, also eucalyptus and other nasal clearing medicines.

"I've been thinking about the life debt thing. What are the terms exactly? Iirc, without back pedaling, he saved you from the white stag and thus has a claim to your life, right? And has decided that his payment will be adding you to the wild hunt. Solid repipe? 

So the terms are clearly stated. You can't offer up something else to appease him, because he wants you. So how do you give up yourself, without actually giving up yourself? Off the top of my head, I can think of a couple semi plausible scenarios.

 The first, and least likely, would be to save/spare his life in return, which would (in theory) cancel out the debt. The devil is in the details here, and while this one is definitely 11/10 on the difficulty scale, an opportunity may present itself. Keep it in mind as a Hail Mary to maybe build off.

The second,  and more murky,  would be to somehow make someone or something else you. How you'd go about this I would really have to do a deep dive into, but I can't imagine any way to do it that wouldn't condemn someone to the same fate you're facing. Maybe find a child predator in prison and convince them trading identities could commute their sentence? I'm just spitballing here. This could solve your immediate problem, but would absolutely piss off the mechanic and Co. I'll keep researching, based on your writing I have an idea of their origin, but anything you could narrow down would help.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdoeGZRcGVJclc5MTJxYlE5VXdYdzcyb2Y2dUMxTkJxUTh2WG5kOGIyTllhNkJ0c3Q0aTJqOHFkSDM0TnpkNlQ3NnpPMk1xTWV1ZVd2a2lzZWtfQi1hQlE9PQ==

"You shouldn’t be alone with this, especially today. You need a hug or a hand to hold. You should go see Sam’s parents today. They probably also wonder if it was their fault. If they could have somehow discouraged her reckless streak in childhood so this never happened. All of your minds are going to be in the same place and they could probably use a hug too. 

It wasn’t your fault or theirs. Someone as smart as Sam should have seen that it was a bad idea to behave so recklessly 364 days out of the year. By the time we make it to college we are all aware that there are things worse than death, and that many of them are caused by reckless behavior. The only one responsible for what happened is Sam. And it’s okay to say that and have feelings about it. It doesn’t make you a bad person or change how much you love her.

"I was in Aokigahara this past June.  I took a 8 mile hike starting at the ice cave and going counterclockwise in a rough circle.  I'm an experienced hiker, had a trail planned, and was using a good GPS.  It should have taken roughly 3-4h max. 

I started around noon and the first two hours were beautiful.  The trail was a bit overgrown, occasionally little more than a deer path, but was easy to follow.  There was the occasional ambush from a joro spider to spook me, but that was offset by hundreds of butterflies, countless birds, and a few badgers.  I was happy, peaceful, and enjoying the day. 

In the third hour the trail veered off sharply and got sparse.  There were pink ribbons around trees marking the path, but they started getting more spread out and the woods got more dense.  The ground was craggy with an abundance of small root-bound mossy caves (more like holes, really) and was increasingly difficult to traverse. 

Then the path was gone.

I was traveling ribbon to ribbon, always keeping the next in sight.  My foot slipped and I took a minute to sit.  When I stood back up there was no ribbon and no trail.  I could see the tree where I'm certain the ribbon was and could see my path through the brush back to where I'm certain the last marker had been.  There were no ribbons to be found.  I checked my Garmin GPS - it showed my dot on the map and the blue line than followed by path.  Both ended where I veered into the woods.  I checked my compass and used it to backtrack, used chalk to mark trees.  My compass led me in circles.  Checked my phone - no signal.  I was deeply, DEEPLY lost.  I checked the time - I had been lost for over two hours.  It didn't feel like it had been that long.  The strangest part is that the birdsong was gone.  Admittedly, that was likely because I was crashing through the underbrush.  It was still eerie to have the forest be totality silent.

The sun was starting to set, so I kept it at my back and walked what I hoped was generally east.  Two more hours I walked.  It was pushing twilight and I didn't bring a headlamp.  I was fighting panic, fearing I would be lost in the dark with no way to call for help.  Just as the night fell I stumbled on a deer trail.  Literally stumbled.  I tripped, scraped my hand on the ground, and looked up to find it right in front of me. I set myself on it and it widened.  Eventually it met up with a large road - the path from the wind cave to the ice cave.  Across the junction was a chain and a giant sign saying ""Danger! Do not enter! "" in English and Japanese, warning against the trail I had just come from.  That's when I noticed that the birds were singing again.  I checked my GPS - my dot was there and the blue line picked up where I'd found the trail.  I had phone signal.

I had missed the last bus, so I had to call for a taxi to get me back to my ryoken.  I had lost almost 5 hours on a stretch of woods that should have taken less than 45min to cross.  I've never experienced anything like it.  I fell out of the world that day, and whatever old things that live in the deeps of Aokigahara chose to let me go.

"You haven't actually reached the Black Chakra, as its not a place that can be reached; none of the chakras are. The places you saw were metaphysical loci for the chakras. Think of them as tests. You go to the locus, and if you reach the proper mental state, you tap into that locus's corresponding chakra. Otherwise, you fail the ""test,"" to varying consequences. That's why the 7 chakra system is the most commonly practiceed. Those chakras are safe.

The black chakra is decidedly NOT safe. It represents the positive side of nihilism. Nothing you do, think, possess, or achieve will ever matter; all that makes you yourself will be forgotten by an uncaring universe thatreduces all to nothing in the wake of its cosmic shrug. Tapping into the black chakra means accepting this fact, but not falling victim to it. If nothing has intrinsic value or permanency, you can assert for yourself the importance and value of your self, your actions, and the people and things *within your own sphere of experience.* You can, in effect, become master of your world, and act according to that which brings you happiness, contentment, and sense of what is right.

Those who have failed in this endeavor fall to the nnegative aspect of this nihilism, becoming spiritually dead; they lose all sense of hope, purpose, and self, seeking only to fill the bleak void that they have unwittingly imposed upon themselves, becoming the husk-like entities you saw, driven by nothing but the basest instinct to consume. As for how these Husks may have entered the physical plane, I can't really say; its entirely possible that they are merely your own traumatic delusions.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9QbGo4YmFiUUJKdy1jS2ZYZUlFSEl5ODNJMnpFLXZaOUFaWjdpM2h1R3RjUkxnZ3hzbG1TWjRwbENQbGw5Z1hYQ2dBZUFtcmRiT3BEWmJEdWxhdllJWUE9PQ==

"It’s totally understandable, I’m someone who struggles to move past and heal from things when I still have unanswered questions swirling in my brain too! 

I can only think of two options, though:

1. This is trauma, it happened when you were younger and perhaps was a cult and a murder of a younger friend or sibling that your mind attempted to protect you from. 

You talked about feeling frozen in place, that your friend was in a trance, people often forget that the fight or flight response isn’t a binary; it’s fight flight freeze and fawn. It’s possible both your brains felt freeze held the best prospects for survival.

If this were the case it would make sense as to why he has no social media presence, he didn’t make it past child or young adulthood etc 

Alternatively, 2. There was something supernatural in play. The events were in real time and more recent, the aging and change in the house and grounds similar to a glamour to deceive any law enforcement when the occupants realised you had escaped and would likely report them.

"You have no clue how personally I do, indeed, know. 

Not to make your shit about me, but maybe it’ll help a little? Idk I’m neurodivergent and stuff. But I was stuck in an abusive marriage for two years, left the U.K. to live in the US with him and got stuck there.

It’s been almost ten years and I still feel so…hollow sometimes like I just can’t make sense of so much of it. Why me? I mean, if he just wanted a wife for the housing allowance, there were cheaper and easier options. Did he ever love me, did he know what love was? Why did he act the way he did? Every answer I’ve ever pieced together has left some other part infuriatingly untied.

I don’t know if it’ll ever feel at peace in my head. I’m hoping that actually addressing my PTSD instead of doing my usual compartmentalising might help, so we’ll see lol. But in a way, does it matter? By that, I don’t mean that what we went through doesn’t matter because of course it does. More; we are where we are right now in this moment.

You know how it is, can't just trust everything I hear. But if it is true, which I'm having a hard time believing, of course they're real people.  No. I believe in spirits. But the thing about spirits, if you look into the scientific/historical documentation, is that they're not seen by more than one person, because they're not physical. Forget what the movies teach you, that a ghost is something everyone sees.

"One of the evidences of alien and ghost encounters is that feeling of dread, even when the being is not seen. Worst casinario, it kills you (it has happened, ask any physicist who's looked at the documentation). Two best casinarios it never does anything (for some arbitrary reason), or, it starts to talk to you. You might hear things you and I thought only schizophrenics heard, you know, those crazy people who ""imagine"" entities telling them ""they're jesus, and that they need to kill themselves for the sin of the world"". These things will be persuasive, they have been persuasive. Don't you wonder why people always do the crazy things they say they were told to do by ghosts?  Kill john Lennon etc.  If demons weren't persuasive by unimaginable degree, they wouldn't have been able to convince the other monstrous angels to betray their own creator. Humans.. don't stand a sliver of chance.  I've only ever heard about people like you, it's interesting to just randomly find someone like this on reddit. There's an obvious solution, If you care to solve it. Most don't. You've discovered the being that claims to the western world to be an extra terrestrial, and that claimed to the Egyptians to be horus, to the Hindus shiva and others, to the native Americans, skin walkers. Dont believe the TV that all these are different phenomenon. They invented the TV.  John logie baird who first pioneered TV got the idea from a seance, where he believes he met Thomas Edisons ""ghost"".
  Or maybe.. you're just paranoid. It's a possibility. As for the solution to all possibilities, utter submission to the creator you've been avoiding your whole life but just don't realize it.

"My immediate thought is this is a family curse, passed down along to women. Or a malevolent spirit? 




Is where you live Ellen's hometown? If so, I suggest you dig around at the library. See if you can figure out when Ellen's maternal grandmother died from obituaries. Go back as far as you can. Will be hard as maiden names will likely change. Ancestry . Com might be helpful, too. Look for newspaper articles about violent crimes. 




There could also be a quieter kind of violence, like something bad to do with a child, a child who might be haunting your daughter. 




If it's not Ellen's hometown, contact a research librarian in various places the family has lived. Including overseas places, possibly.

"Why are you content with Clara's happiness?  Because it's a false happiness - a lie being perpetrated on her by something with unknown intentions.  If you were to ask the person she was before your loss a hypothetical question wherein a creature with - almost certainly - ill intent took the place of a dead child and tricked a mother to think it was hers, would she really think it was a Good Thing?  Or would would she have said that it was an evil, abusive and torturous act committed against a vulnerable woman?  I suspect you know what the answer would have been.  There are dark and evil things in this world that like to use human beings as playthings.  That is what you have on your hands.  If you really do love her, you have to try to save her.  There are also good and wise people out in the world, and you can find them if you are in need.

"I mean, ""I Am the Rain"" is one of my favorite songs by Firewater, but I wouldn't say it's exactly a recommendation when it comes to joining the inhuman world by letting your ex-boyfriend merge with you and take you over.

I hope the devil does turn out to have something useful to say about this, because you're kind of starting to worry me with the thinking this is maybe not such a bad idea. 

It is. It is a very bad idea. Do not become part of the rain. Grayson has been a manipulative jerk this whole time. Don't let him manipulate you into giving up your life for him.

"So there's obviously someone monitoring the ""Wailers"", maybe even the people who interfere. The red lights and alarm would be set off by the people who set the Wailers loose, and we could suppose that the van is either them picking up the Wailer and the person that interferes, or maybe the van is from someone else set out to catch the Wailers or the people that interfere. All we can know is that she was right. You are being watched.

I think it safe to say that all the Wailers are people related to at least one person in the building (also must be determined if the rest of the age group buildings are also involved) and set off as bait to catch more people for some reason other than to be used as Wailers for the next victims.

I understand that you want to move back with your parents, but you've been made a part of something that you'll never forget, and you, just like the rest of us, are gonna want answers. If you dont stay, try to keep contact with Mey or Mateo and ask them to talk to other  residents. Try to find out if anyone has ever recognised a Wailer and successfully ignored it, or if there have been any strange happenings where things didn't follow through as expected.

Good luck, and please update soon.

And the pins. I feel like they're supposed to have a meaning or something, yk? Bc why pins?

As the top comment said, it's probable that they were keeping him tethered to your imagination - which, as much as it sucks, relatively better than the thing being free in physical world now.

I don't know if this counts, but when you were at the doctor, all Albert could do was stare at you, so he was clearly not as strong (or at least didn't show it) and no one paid attention.

"Sometimes the barriers between worlds are thinner than we'd like.  Unfortunately, there are individuals whose very nature can cause these barriers to be even more insubstantial than usual, which can make for an exciting - but usually short - life.  The fact that Max is hearing sounds from that world you slipped into makes me think he might be one such.  There's really not much you can do, other than staying as far away from such people as possible so that you're not around when they inevitably cause a breech.  As for being one of those people . . . well, make sure you always have a few emergency supplies/equipment with you just in case you wander through a breech.  And always carry something of great sentimental value connected to someone important to you, as that will usually allow you to find your way back, should you survive the dangers you'll undoubtedly stumble onto.

"Thank you for your stories! Thirty plus years ago was my first introduction to anime and manga (I am an old widowed grandma), and this was before internet. I was introduced by a guy who would be labeled an incel these days, and all of it was practically pornographic. I developed a quick lack of interest in anime. Except for that, there was Sailor Moon over the years, and my ex and sons all were obsessed with Dragonball. 

Then my wise son rolled his eyes about a year ago and said, “Mom, you don’t understand - there is a lot of different kinds… I think the first thing he had me watch was Demon Slayer. By later last year/early this year I got my own Crunchyroll account. As I watched a lot of his favorite shows, though, I began seeing repeated characters, and I said, “These are completely based on Japanese mythology, and are the various spirits, monsters, etc., developed in their culture,” and I went out and bought a book on Yokai. 

I agree that there can be real evil, but as you have also learned, sometimes a little knowledge and some empathy can get you through a lot of encounters. 

I look forward to hearing more. Thank you so much. This makes me very happy.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTB0MFJuNFh6YzBRdWRPcUhzMHowbkFOTVVORUd0cUxhQVUzdEZNaWpnZHNVOXVwbWNBS0p5ZEpWajVGOV8wMGxYUGlKM3F3X1NuV3c0bGVaUTc3cmRXNVE9PQ==
"I’ll cop to a lot of anime inspired writing lol. It’s something that was big for me as a kid who didn’t really fit in, first getting into the early series on Toonami like dragonball and Naruto hitting the US as I got into middle school. It was great seeing so many stories about overcoming through sheer force of will and getting to see how the various spirits are interpreted. 

And I’m jealous! You have so much awesome to discover over the past few decades of anime/manga. It’s definitely diverse!

Yokai are just fascinating to me as well, even with all the terror they’ve brought me. Some are so benevolent and just want to bring mischief, but many are just misunderstood lost souls that are in search of belonging.

"I agree. I think in all of humanity we have an apprehension of the numinous, and that it echoes through all cultures and histories. Something awhile back (can’t remember if it was read or watched?) said that humans create the supernatural by believing it into existence, and if we didn’t have think they existed, they wouldn’t be able to. 

That said, I didn’t realize until getting Discovery plus that all the ghost stuff was on Travel channel. I became fascinated by some of it. My husband died in 2020, and I have insomnia that often starts with awakening at three am, and on ghost hunting, the midnight I used to hear being the witching hour as a child has moved to three am. 

Is he visiting and I can’t see him or hear him, but his presence wakes me? If I believe more will he be able to show up more? Is it all fantasy and how our normal sleep rhythms tend to wake us anyhow?

"I find myself agreeing. There's a tragic, solemn beauty to all of this, for all of the horror.


The questions of agency and consent and boundaries are so very real and significant and yet, expecting *a consciousness as alien as the rain itself*, something that outside of his meat element, experiences no such reality of boundary (imagine how maddening, to consider the sense of violence, of violation, of having your puddles splashed, drops parted, if such a concept were allowed to you?)


Ashley is ...right in her conflict and empathy here. And her terror.


His overreaching is profound. How do you teach the rain about healthy boundaries?! 
It starts with honesty I guess, and in that sense, Grayson is... exultant in finally showing his cards, although he claims its too late to follow any other path.


But the inhuman notably aren't very clear on the nuances of choice, being denied the luxury.


I think it's too early for Ash and co to give up on him, but Grayson, if you want to be a real boy, you need to meet humanity on *their* terms, and be upfront when your sense of understanding simply isn't grappling.

"Yeesh, that's an uncomfortable position to be in. A few pieces of advice:

- First and foremost, you should call your Aunt Becky. Play it off as a casual call just to check in after seeing her Facebook post. See if she mentions the fact that Jeremy is living with you - if she mentions it without you prompting it, that's a good sign. If not, you can mention it and gauge her reaction.

- Don't install secret cameras in Jeremy's room. This is very illegal and can likely get you expelled, if not arrested. But you should definitely check out his room some time when he's not home, if only just to see if you notice anything unusual.

- Get a clear photo of one of these centipedes.

"It is !!! 

Deirdre know his name. I don't  think she can win in a physical fight but she's not defensless.

And yes of course we can keep talking about how he keeps kissing her. We can cry about it. We can DM about it. We can fanfic about it. Whatever you want ! 

I don't think the dynamic is wasted on Nessa, I think it works because of how she is. It's unfortunate that Namekink is so busy havind fun while driving jer mad to realise he is ruining his one game. Like when he ignored her plea to help her grandpa to enoy her and it backfired when Dreidre came to save the day, or when he made Nessa notice her own feeling. The whole time I was facepalming because he was sinking histoire own ship !!! Dumb huntsman !!!!! 

Anyway I find it cute  how Nessa is in fact the agressive one, like Namekink is being very carefull about her (by his standard) and she comes at him with all she have, full or murder intent. It's endearing cause I keep picturing a kitty trying to take on a lion 😹 . But in the meantime it's a little sad for Namekink...

"Oh my gosh the fanfic would go SO HARD! Can you imagine if to distract him in a crucial moment, Nessa just kisses him on the mouth and he’s so distracted that she manages to get away with whatever she’s trying to do???? Also why do I feel like he’d actually sacrifice himself for her at some point? I think he talks a VERY big game about “tolerating” her (like when he threatened to rip her tongue out), but he wouldn’t actually do anything truly terrible to her? I mean, especially when you consider what he’s been known to do to people who ACTUALLY piss him off. I feel like she could get him to that point where he wants to, but I think he’d stop himself at the last second.

You’re so right, he really shot himself in the foot there. He’s got no one to blame but his own self! He could’ve won SO MANY points if he helped her with her grandpa… that was tragic.

"You know, English is not my native, also I'm not much of a writer. This story was incredibly difficult to read because of how you divided the paragraphs and didn't use any quotation marks. 

Please, while dividing paragraphs, make sure you don't split your sentences right in the middle of them. Finish the sentence first, then start another paragraph. It's better when sentences in a paragraph are united by one idea.

Also I'd like to see proper punctuation marks in the direct and indirect speech in the story. Capital letters is another thing I'd be happy to find in right places.

Punctuation is not an empty sound, it helps texts be readable.

Quite like the first half of the story though. Later I got lost somewhere between unreadable lines and didn't get your antagonist's motivation at all. Why did he film such a show?

"So horrible. 😞

I walked into a chicken house and found a black snake stuck at the base of the hen’s neck - it couldn’t swallow any farther. Her feet were drumming like crazy. I prayed it was because she was suffocating, not past it, and grabbed snake behind head and pulled my hen out of it. She had chicks, and probably struck at the snake as it attempted to take them. 

Then I was in a bit of a conundrum- almost suffocated hen in one hand, probably slightly upset, 5-ft-long constrictor in the other. Lucky for me, grandkids were visiting, and had alerted me to the rope in the chicken house, and followed me to see what they found (my guess was it managed to get to the chicken when they came to the house for me). One was handed the hen, told to keep her still and warm and let me know if she didn’t start breathing. Other was dispatched to retrieve grandpa so I had another set of adult hands to deal with the five foot long constrictor. 

Good times. I know more now than I do now. Unfortunately, it doesn’t include perfectly keeping black snakes out of chicken houses.

"Reddit recommended me here. I didn't know there was a short horror story sub, which is a ton of fun! Great writing! I enjoyed how you started light-humored and got darker as the story progressed. It was only a bit, but you got a sense of the family as a whole, which makes the rest heartbreaking.


My only critique is snakes generally don't leave behind bones - not unless they regurgitate prey before full digestion. The python would leave behind massives poo tho and anything indigestible would persumably pass through (maybe plastics? their stomachs are impressive).



Weird to say, but I do appreciate you having the snake eat the small son! A lot of people don't realize snakes can't eat most humans (even these massive ones). Their jaws just can't get around the clavicles. Anacondas are the only ones that really break bones and even they don't go for it. Children and petite adults are the only ones at risk. Your massive python would need a lot of energy to move and to not waste that energy, would definitely want to target children on purpose.

"Yes. And she defended all of her chicks successfully. My granddaughter was very good at holding her and keeping her warm while she got her breath back. Those snakes love eggs, and since you don’t close the chickens out of their chicken house or coop, they can come and go as they please. 

The frustrating thing about that adventure is my husband blew me off. I finally had to walk to the house to get him - none of the kids would hold an empty feed sack open for me to put the snake into. He drove it to the top of the hill and it escaped out of the bag already when he went to set it free, so he just walked back. 

Our state department of conservation states that they only grow six feet. I know that is inaccurate, because one we caught looked huge, so he held it up as high as he could reach (he was a hair under six foot) and what was left on the ground still curled in a circle. 😮

"Either you met Paimon, or you met someone/something that *invoked* Paimon. Once an angel, he sided with Lucifer during the rebellion, and was cast into Hell. He is the 9th demon of the Ars Goetia, a King of Hell, and the most loyal of Lucifer's servants. He is known to grant the requests of humans, which he has a boundless hatred for. He does this because, much like in traditional tales of genies, he will attempt to twist the requests of those who parley with him, inflicting as much psychological and/or physical torment as possible, often through the use of horrific nightmares and visions, as well as his voice itself, which is an ear-splitting roar.

You may be able to resist this affliction by way of a religious blessing by a priest of the Abrahamic faiths, especially invoking the mercy and protection of the angel Haziel, who originally defeated him during the rebellion and cast him into Hell",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FjWXhpLVk0cDlpZzYtWEdqNmJBS045TG5QN3c4QnNYUDBCREl6a2hHWnk5ZS1oTFo4bVdaWXpJcUNZLWQ5cTBPSDRreW5TTVVVTVJIR3BwSmMxZ2oyb1E9PQ==

"Masterfully written. God I love this. It's incredible. Awful, of course, but magnificent.

There's the obvious link to [*Do not pray to the god in the desert*](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/yynrn7/do_not_pray_to_the_god_in_the_desert/), which also lives ""in"" a wall (rather, the wall happens to stand where the portal to the god is) and needs to be covered up lest the god have more impact on our world. But just being near the wall, let alone seeing it, is enough to cause one's mind to crack. And it's a Red Queen's race, anyway, that we will ultimately lose. We're just buying time.

Also reminded me of *The Borderlands*, a 2013 found-footage horror also about a church built on top of an underground labyrinth containing something deeply *wrong*. A deity or demon or something we can neither comprehend nor ever hope to destroy. Especially this part:

> I am trapped, suffocating, in total darkness as some invisible fluid burns my skin. But no matter how much I scream or cry, I can’t claw my way to freedom. Instead, the more I thrash, the more those ribbed mucus covered walls seem to compress around me until I can hardly breathe.

But most of all, it reminded me of Lovecraft. The cosmic horror. The minds being stretched like slinkies until they are hopelessly distorted. The most we can hope for is to seal it up and try to forget about it. Lovecraft had a lot of great ideas, especially [Cosmicism,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmicism) but his writing was bogged down by his preoccupation with dreams, disgusting racism, and so on. It's hard to write a good story where a dream is a key plot point that improves the work rather than detracts from it. It can be done, but not often.

The entity in this story seems very similar to [Azathoth,](https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Azathoth) the blind, mad god at the centre of the universe. It is both omnipotent and omniscient, but also insane and sleeping. Our entire universe is merely its dream. Our ""reality"" is not real at all beyond Azathoth itself.

> the boundless daemon sultan Azathoth, whose name no lips dare speak aloud, and who gnaws hungrily in inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond time and space amidst the muffled, maddening beating of vile drums and the thin monotonous whine of accursed flutes. (**Lovecraft**)

Azathoth lives at the centre of absolute chaos, a kind of primordial darkness deeper than the mere absence of light--it is the absence of reality altogether. When the characters complained of darkness, I don't think they were talking about the darkness in the church.

> With each step, the darkness felt heavier (**Mike**)

> ""It’s so dark in here."" (**Alec**)

> “It’s so dark in here."" (**Marie**)

>  it sounded like he was saying *it’s so dark in here*. (**Mike, of Alec**)

>  Slowly, a kind of darkness seeped into my thoughts. (**Mike**)

Azathoth is surrounded by formless thralls dancing to strange music, throbbing in time with his madness, a discordant beat. This story has no drums nor flutes, but a piano, however, very much tracks.

> Someone pressed a key on the piano and everything inside me came to a screeching halt. It was dull and off-key... a dreadful song. A strange discordant tone. Weak and off-key (**Mike**)

> ancient legends of Ultimate Chaos, at whose center sprawls the blind idiot god Azathoth, Lord of All Things, encircled by his flopping horde of mindless and amorphous dancers (**Lovecraft**)

I think the artist saw this. He saw close enough to the centre to glimpse its domain and the dancers, before desperately covering it all up in an act of both self-preservation and self-sacrifice. I think he painted the dancers, tortured, flayed, suffering, mindless, and misshapen. I think this is how the entity, Azathoth or whoever, collects its dancers, whether on purpose or without conscious intention. When people see it they become enslaved by the madness of their broken minds. The entity is unaware or doesn't care one way or another. Is that the fate of humanity? To gradually be collected by this thing, and all end up circling it, dancing and writhing in agony until all of us are there and no-one else remains, and then when it wakes up and we all finally cease to be, oblivion being far sweeter than the madness bestowed by Azathoth.

> even the slightest glimpse of it would result in the utter and complete destruction to the beholder (**Lovecraft**)

> Or maybe I’m just going mad!? (**Mike**)

Reality is the dream of Azathoth. Nothing is actually real beyond the terrible being itself at the centre of it all. It's all, literally, a dream. Not *our* dream, but a dream nonetheless.

> ""I think I might be dreaming."" (**Alec**)

> ""Am I dreaming?"" (**Marie**)

> everything that had happened was just some kind of sick dream. (**Mike**)

> Slowly, it came to me as a powerful truth that all the time I’d spent outside that room was a lie. Just a kind of dream. All the daylight I’d since seen. The mornings waking in my own bed. The sight of London’s skyline, and the sound of a world made of bright and colourful things. Those memories were just thin plastic over a far deeper truth. That room. Alec’s collapse. Marie’s disappearance. They were the only real things I’d experienced. And the cold and damp and dark were all that remained to me. There was no outside world. All of that was a dream. *His dream*. (**Mike**)",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FkN0JHd25fNG1Qak50Zlh3OVhEQXI0ZUh3aE16X2hrMi1yQ184XzN2UFdCX0JiNHVvaGtuQ0Z5MGhIbGEtNlNSUm02UFlMenh0dXhGVTdIZlJLMWQ3WGc9PQ==

"I can understand the willingness to do almost Anything to get rid of the pain. I've had chronic sometimes literally crippling pain that lasts for days to months.

Especially as to how all my loved ones died,or are 1000s of kms away,and the people I had around me all let me down so hello pain my only freakin friend. 

It freakin Sucks to have to literally drag yourself around the floor not being able to stand(almost died from dehydration because of that)& being alone. Or the Fun if your with somebody of them having to carry you to the bathroom. Fxcking Sucks and I'd probably bend my morals just to have the ""high pain free life"" for a min. I've basically given up. At least you havent,and you got to live the high life for a min. I've started from the ground up w literally just the clothes on my back(one time even Without shoes) and I'd pay the price just to feel pain free,ballin and have a ""community""even if  just for a min cause I literally have nothing left to lose but myself and I'm ready to lose that cause Everything I believed inand lived for is assed backwards or straight BS.

3. Tell “Clive” or whoever, that you need a wet/dry shop vac. Mopping up blood ‘just for the hell of it’ is for the birds. Let the shop vac do the hard work.

"Let me speculate. 

Pauline is definitely feeding this thing that comes out of the drain or sacrificing tenants to it. The issue that both hinders you and saves you is the sleep paralysis. The creature — that the ritualistic sacrifice is connected to — mentioned itself it can only consume people who are awake. Thus when it pushes you in an attempt to wake you up, you're paralysis prevents it. Your inability to move also makes it question if you're dead. The creature also uses your name in that final night potentially because Pauline told it who is this cycle's sacrifice. The final night is its whatever deadline for a feast and screamed hard to wake you up. No effect. You either kept your cool perfectly or really was paralysed.

Pauline failed to give it it's due and it came back for revenge. Not under the effects of sleep paralysis, she probably was way too obvious when awake and that creature took whatever it needed — her.

"It depends on the revenant. There are various types. For example, Victor counts as one. Some can be reasoned with, while others are driven only by primitive impulses. 

If it's a draugr or something similar, iron and salt can harm it, though I don't recommend taking one on, especially alone. Sounds like it could be vindictive,  like it's looking for a certain person.

"Yeah, it sounds like this revenant might have been dead for a while before getting back up again, if the general condition of the hiker and their signature sun bleached jacket is anything to go by... Maybe their death anniversary happened recently?

My current theory is that the revenant was a victim of a 'hiking accident', which is why it is attacking hikers fitting a particular physical profile. 

I might have to, if this is a revenant that can't be reasoned with. The 'Weathered Hiker' has already sent two thru-hikers to the ER. And I can't bring Kieran for backup, as even with the 'bottle of river water' trick, he seems to have a fairly short 'leash' regarding how far he can go from his river, before the 'collar' starts digging into his neck.

I’m so sorry for your loss. I was where your son was several years ago and I did attempt to end things. Thankfully I was unsuccessful. I can tell you that your son hid his true feelings from you because he thought he was protecting you. When you are at that lowest point you truly believe that those that love you will be better off without having to deal with you and your problems. Your son loved you and there was nothing you could have done or said that would have changed his mind so please don’t blame yourself. I promise that is the last thing he would have wanted.

"The journal has Blue’s Clues on the cover, are all the details correct? Blue has all of her spots? Any other characters shown are accurate?

Aside from the “flashlight goggles” are there any other objects described that either don’t make sense or have such a childlike sense of perspective you have re-interpret them?

I’m asking because maybe her story seems not to make sense and there’s no record of it happening because Roxy isn’t from here. I don’t mean she’s a space alien. Or at least not in the way we typically think.
But maybe she’s not from “here”, meaning not this version of “here”. Maybe she’s from an alternate dimension. This parasitic worm attack happened; it just didn’t happen to this version of reality.
The other possibility is when she’s from, and that she’s not from this when. Maybe she’s a refugee from a not-so-distant future. The spin-off from the original Blue’s Clues is still running. Who knows how long it’ll continue running, and how long it will stay popular enough to have themed merchandise for kids.

I dunno, just another few theories to add to the list.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNoNjdUVXZ0cFVsbVV5UUk4RWt6aC00U1AtVm51bUlLbENocWxmeEZlYWNqcmpMM29YNFhYdlBzNVcxTmJwZnpWVEtBck5pcnNVQlRXcnExQ2xyUmFaRkRhSDRlMmozeHh6Y2FQbmhsZkV0NU09

"Yay Loch! Horses are amazing even when they aren’t enchanted entities.

I have never broke a horse on my own and worry I would mess it up, so I have two very pretty adult pasture ornaments - a Polish Arabian mare and an Egyptian Arabian gelding.

You don't have to convince anyone .... any idea how was that vortex opened? And what exactly that entity was? Because you said that real Marie tries to reach out to you in your dreams... so how was this vortex like thing opened and why did everything begin only a month ago?,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNpbkZzZDF1MWZ0a0JJMTJmR1BFWnV1SnZtaGxPdjYyeHB0OVlHWmdONUM5R3hRRG9ydERXSmFsTmtWNFdZOXJXT2hONGF5N2ZsWXl1V2lWWFoyYk9xdjlWN3pRMkVXaEtHTFBSSFZwd3BsQ2c9
"Yeah, I was pretty upset too to find out that I would eventually reach a point where I'd have to spend sleep points just to continue existing.  I had really hoped I could eventually find a way to live a normal life like this, but unfortunately, even when you do everything right, it's still a race against the clock. 

And I do end up discussing the prospect of moving my bed with my dad after making an effort to do it myself.  It seems a bit strange to him, but nowhere near as weird as I had psyched myself out about it being.

Though I'm guessing Annie didn't suggest this, seeing as how see she probably would've wanted me to take the initiative of doing it myself instead of making excuses.  She probably would've preferred it if I had taken a more self-sufficient route, but I think at the end of the day, she was just mainly concerned with whether or not it had gotten done.  

And she's obviously not gonna complain about me having spent some time with my dad since she never really seemed to appreciate my habit of holing myself up in my room, away from my parents.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNpOEtWZjNyazJWMFo5dEJmTldCS0w4Umd1ckhWenRadDRsbm9tQzBQUTF5aVF4d2JrcmFQMm95dHI2TGs1aGt2aWNpQWJ4ODZoclkzdzFiRFJnVHNhNmc9PQ==

"«as of now, from outside the box, you’re both alive and dead»

clearly the evil man doesn’t understand quantum mechanics. To be “both alive and dead,” their lives should depend on a quantum phenomenon, not on something that happens in the future (ie finding the key.) from the outside of the box, the state of the victims is simply unknown to an outside observer, whilst in the Schrodinger’s cat the state of the rather unlucky cat is fundamentally undefined. It is simply unknown what happened in the box, it is not undefined. 


glad you’ve made it out tho. as someone who’s an amateur about quantum mechanics, i couldn’t help but point that out.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNqVXowWHJpZ0lSaUozUTZWMnpjRmFvU2NvWkFydUxZeGh5bjZPejVZZ3RYVldIdDMxai1IR29wanJHV1htdkVsQkFWNi1DZ1VoaXJlM2d0NU1Nekdqenc9PQ==

"I would love to. I have had a few house chickens and they taught me so much. The most recent house chicken was Ms Scarlett, and during her almost 13 years she taught me that chickens know more about being a mom and raising chicks than a human being would know, and letting them do their job made both our lives easier. When she began developing mobility problems, I tried to move her inside, and she made it obvious she wasn’t willing to go. I waited probably a year and tried again. Nope. But the night when I went to close up the chicken house and she hurried to me as fast as she could, I knew she was ready. Taught me so much about their intelligence.  My first house chicken was named Maria Elena, with the Maria being a reference to Sound of Music. She refused to stay with the flock from being a chick. She had issues and died young, but started me in the journey from “cute feathered things to dote on” to “individuals with their own preferences, relationships, families…”

Welcome new friend. Chickens are cautious, but they will also yell a warning to the rest of the flock as a predator attacks them. I had a rooster that fought foxes to save hens.

"Thé State of the cat inside the box is undefined until observed! The schrodingers cat is a paradox that something is both dead and alive, imageing the concept of particle duality or in most cases a superposition case, as an example. That is, the particle can be both a wave or a particle until observed, as soon as it is observed, it takes a state. Schrodingers cat is meant for criticism to the Copenhagen interpretation, that when the cat is not observed, it can be both dead and alive, until the box is opened.
But you are completly right about the key, when the Quantum state (the persons) depend on finding the key, then it doesn’t image the paradox anymore. To make it right, it should depend upon when the outside observer decides to unlock the door, and observers our states:D",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNqbkpoaUhTY01jc1RjWjVIRHlkMGVkdUZqTlJQclZIZ2cwa3R5ZnN2c0dkWDlSS1kwS2VpRkxmNWJpdXpCSWpZNl9YMjFDV3NLOVpYcURzc2NlYThuUmc9PQ==

Hollow Keepers, like False Trees, aren't necessarily evil, but guardians of the forest.

Generally speaking, as long as they and their homes are treated with respect, they won't harm you. 

However, it should also be noted that Hollow Keepers have been known to seduce humans, either driving them to madness or becoming insanely jealous if they believe that human has been unfaithful to them. If the Hollow Keeper seems *too* friendly, it might be best to stay away.

"So, I have chronic migraines.
Like. Confirmed by neurologists and a boatload of tests -CT scans, MRIs, MRVs, Lumbar Punctures, and a couple of rounds of occipital nerve blocks.

I don’t know what’s going on with you, but they don’t even sound like migraine other than the headache part. Migraine doesn’t cause confusion or memory loss. If painkillers or high doses of an anti-histamine are administered, they can cause the memory loss but not a migraine on their own. Vestibular migraine could cause the dizziness, but it’s recommended to seek emergency medical treatment with those because they’re so closely related to strokes.
And as far as counting to ten to will yourself calm and meditating the migraine away? That’s not a thing. Once a brain becomes trapped in the pattern of activity congruent with migraine (scientists are still exploring but it seems the brain wave pattern is related  tando seizure activity), the only way to free it from that cycle is several hours of Delta-wave sleep. Delta wave sleep cannot be triggered or induced by drugs. It can only be brought on through the natural progression of sleep cycles.
Not to mention all the other health issues you seem to have interconnected to one another.

So, I dunno what’s going on with you but it isn’t migraines. Somebody is lying to you, telling you that a symptom is the disease.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGN0d09jRXBFVklXMGd2T0ljQlloR0Rubi1hUWM1X212YkFrOXVCVXh6ekFNcW1BX1pSemM4dHFvb2swcXBfVHNobzhpcHphWXU0OFEzRFpaNzZTUGlVcm03SnhjM2QzdVh0eElna3lyQjlpU2M9

"I think the wife outside might know there's a dangerous person inside too, which is why she took the spare key but then left. She wants to be able to get inside her house, just not right this second when there's an unknown person in there with her husband convincing him not to let her in.


But the indoor wife also asked a qualifying question, which as someone else already pointed out, means she probably knew the answer. Then again, it's possible she just knew that asking that question would take some suspicion off of her, and it would be unlikely for her husband to turn in her and reiterate that question to her directly.",r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGN1Vzg5NW1VZzRTWklmNWI4QTFTVHZMUW1YZXdwWTZlZXpHM0N2WmNlMzNXZVFaWVUxV2U4bnJoYmFkeEdCZXR5cjdvOFN2X0lFeEFXY3JJbXVmZjdKaUE9PQ==
