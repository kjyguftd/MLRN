"I did my masters on RTGs.

Not only are they completely different from nuclear reactors other than using nuclear fuel (and to add to that they use plutonium 238 which is not used in nuclear reactors but a byproduct of producing plutonium 239), they’re are also far from efficient. 

RTGs were not designed with efficiency in mind. Their strengths are very long life and stable output. In terms of power to weight ratio they’re pretty bad. Also most energy is radiated away a very low percentage is converted to electricity.",r/nuclear,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYc0F6bFFjUFc4cDhIU0V6Z00yTGo4MUNFLU9FUF9qc3hybXUycjFpYllTX0Z4TVQwS2JmVjUtWlJ1VGpYZGNIVURIMWppbi1IQ0Q1cUIwS0JsWGwwckE9PQ==

"No.  Water is a moderator and slows down neutrons so water cooled reactors can only be thermal spectrum reactors.  Fast spectrum reactors require entirely different types of reactors built to meet very different requirements.  

It can be done, it should be done, it should have already been one on an industrial scale by now.

Russia has a series of fast spectrum breeder reactors called the BN series.  Russia is also building a lead cooled fast breeder reactor.  You should look at it.  The US also used to have the Integral Fast Reactor program with its Experimental Breeder Reactor 2.

"Yes, they are ineffective and low yield. BUT! ... It was the best solution for the rovers at the time. Solar energy is intermittent and has a terrible weight to energy ratio,since it needs photovoltaic as well as storage. A constant 110 watts is better than drip charging and decreasing effectiveness by more than 1% per year on top of anything that might cover the panels and reduce it further.

The plutonium used, I've been told, was made by irradiating neptunium in reactors.

A promising technology that is similar, is nano diamond batteries. It will be interesting to see if it can be upscaled for better yields.

But the main product, heat, is still something we need to utilize better. I believe there are great possibilities in district heating with nuclear. Especially in cities.
Russia, Ukraine and China are doing it.
Finland has started a project where they want to use SMR for heating.
It has also been proposed to use spent nuclear fuel, for district heating.

Electricity isn't the biggest energy form we consume. Inba country like Denmark, it's only 10% of our combined consumption. The largest part is heating, coming from burning biomass and fossil gas.

"I will remind you that France is the model for decarbonization and its power generation is what Germany should emulate.  France has had a per capita carbon footprint that is a fraction of Germany's for decades. 

It has been about 2 years since the news emerged so my memory is a little bit weaker.  The Garzweiler coal mine was expanded.  There was [a hilarious story about Germany destroying wind turbines to expand its coal mining](https://euobserver.com/green-economy/arf0893c11). There was also the much more somber story about [the village of Lutzeranth being demolished](https://archive.ph/U6sAH) to extract more coal. 

That was done to provide fuel for [the coal fired power plants that were being restarted](https://www.npr.org/2022/09/27/1124448463/germany-coal-energy-crisis).  The incredible stupidity of this was that a supposedly green party that supposedly cares about climate change did this while continuing to shut down its non polluting and non carbon emitting nuclear power plants.  Nuclear power plants which also release far less radioactive material per GWh of power produced than coal power. 

Now for a little common sense.  When coal fired power plants are restarted in Germany that means German coal use increases.  The only way that coal use wouldn't increase is due to highly energy demanding industries like steel, ammonia, cement, etc. shutting down and leaving Germany.  That de industrialization is also a bad thing when Germany's strong industries were the reason for Germany's economy being so much stronger than the rest of the EU countries.  A lot of the German chemical industry ended up moving to Louisiana's cancer alley. 

The fact that Germany also burns so much fossil gas is only marginally better than burning coal.  Gas isn't so great.  The supposed hydrogen economy uses equipment that will also work for gas and I suspect that the plans for a hydrogen economy are merely a front to continue burning so much gas.  I guess it is great for the Qatari royal family and the Texas fossil fuel companies that I despise. 

France is the model to emulate when trying to decarbonize a power grid.  France has been outperforming Germany in decarbonization for decades.",r/nuclear,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYZnBrUzdhSWZzWUNFeWNPSVdlYmY1SGhXWXFFaXlsVXR6aEhBOGdkR0dUOFhaRG12bDh1VFdJQ3hoNVFRaWVUTEtDWUJzU2QwcGQ1aWhGa0ZCZ2MwTEE9PQ==

"Most of the plutonium 238 was basically a byproduct of producing plutonium 239 for bombs. After the initiative to reduce the stockpiles was taken up by the USSR and USA plutonium 239 production was stopped and as a result production  of Pu238 as well. 

Russia sold most if not all its Pu238 to the US and since then the US supply is dwindling. That’s why there’s been research into more efficient devices, but aside from improvement to the basic RTG design no other concepts caught on.

It’s true that heat is a huge part of the energy we use but in most parts of the world the issue is there’s no infrastructure for it. One thing the communists got right in my opinion is they invested heavily into CHP plants and district heating systems.

"I never stated that France doesn't have a great carbon footprint or that coal is the way to go. I feel like you are trying to straw man me. 

France has a lot of aging nuclear power plants with some safety concerns that will need more and more maintenance as time goes on and will be shut down sooner or later. France also doesn't do a great job at replacing those power plants. The result is that it needs to import a lot of power from time to time, mainly from Germany.

If you actually read the article you claim it's about power plants being restarted it says those power plants are not shut down as scheduled. You still didn't name the mine that was reopened. Expanding an open pit mine is just keeping them open.

Gas has about half the CO2 per kWh and none of the radioactive ash problems coal has.

I never stated that German coral usage didn't increase during the crisis. Germany had to replace gas power and parts of France's shut down nuclear capacity. However coral usage is down a lot compared to 1990 when the push for renewables and the shutdown of nuclear plants was started. Back then Germany was making about 300 GWh from coal, even at the peak during the crisis it was less than 200, now it's back down to below 150.

The Supreme Court also overturned Cabin Post, which now allows a complainant to sue within six years of when a law started *impacting them negatively*, not the old standard of *within six years of the laws passage*.  This creates another administrative mess where (new) businesses can *re-discover* some decades old law is impacting them and pursue a legal ruling…which may be an administrative standard under Chevron and is now open to re-litigation decades later.

"Do you feel the Chevron defense significantly affected nuclear power in the 1980s?

In general, removing arbitrary powers from a regulatory body would *tend* to be good for the industry that is being overseen.  But I don't think nuclear power stalled because the NRC was ""unreasonable"" or ""overly heavy-handed"", but primary for economic issues, outside the control of nuclear power itself.  
  
Growth of electricity demand was much lower (for a couple reasons) than previously expected, and cheaper sources of power (natural gas, for instance) were available.  (NG was cheaper because of the significant costs of the large up-front capital costs of a nuclear plant, especially in a high cost of capital period.)

So since the NRC wasn't the primary organization keeping plants from being built, I don't think Chevron being passed in the 1980s is what crushed nuclear power, and I don't think removing it will lead to some huge rebound.

"It gives courts a lot more power to decide what is within and against regulations. In theory this could bypass much of the red-tape making new construction slow and expensive, but in practice it will probably open up the way for a many, many lawsuits even in cases where all regulations were followed, and where no harm was done. Just have a look at how any technical topic is handled in count to see how well those will go. 

There are people willing to sue over literally anything, and quite a lot of judges that won't honor accepted standards when given a convincing sob story.

"Speaking from outside the USA:

Some industries need specialist regulation. The whole point of setting up specialist regulators is that the task requires deep skills in a niche which national legislators don't have; and it usually requires a rule-based system which doesn't perfectly fit the existing system of national legislatures and courts. So the government delegates some authority to a group of specialists to draw up detailed rules and some monitoring & enforcement mechanisms.

It's *good* to have a separate regulator which deeply understands the nuclear industry, or food hygiene, or vehicle safety, or banking, or drug testing - and which is granted the ability (within some boundaries) to write rules, interpret them, and enforce them in a way that fits how the industry works. Outcomes for industries, and the public, would be worse if this was done by the average politician and police-officer.

Ending Chevron deference undermines that, just a little bit. It doesn't abolish the whole system but definitely weakens it in situations where a regulated entity has the time & money for a big court case.

"There's methods of processing used fuel to make new fuel.  The French do it and IIRC about 30% of their fuel comes from reprocessing.   Its illegal in the US for proliferation reasons as it means plutonium handling by civilians.   It doesn't require changing the reactors at all because its the same straight through U238/U235 mix.

As for running off of spent fuel, its much more challenging.  Yes you want fast reactors for this as the cross section of U238 favours fast neutrons.  It turns into Neptunium239 and then decays to Plutonium239.  Then another neutron hit and you get fission.

I dont know enough to comment as an expert.  Im an armchair who has simply read copious amounts.  Unless I stand to be corrected, this doesn't really help much as it's still inefficient in a solid fueled reactor.  You run it without a moderator.  I dont know if the presence of Cesium137 and Strontium90 thats produced as standard waste gums up the works.

There are radically different designs built specifically for this.  Instead of Zirconium clad rods of fuel, you use salt to chemically bind to the heavy elements in a liquid. Chloride or Fluoride chemistry lets all these heavy elements flow, so arent encumbered by the limiting physics of solids.  You can then burn down a lot more of the material.  

To your original question, the answer is no I believe. Any change to fuel cycles requires different reactor characteristics.. fuel shape, different neutron economy, moderation, coolant, etc.  Too much to modify existing reactors.",r/nuclear,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZU3p4YksyMjdsT25CZDZHWUxrcUh5VnVJd0NYZHhsYUVrZlhydzNDOHAwRk5HZk02Z2JCbnFXcU9DZzBLQ0FjU1ptMGpYYzc3MTVGd3dtRVphYTBRb3c9PQ==

"Oh, it's not as though current power reactors can't recycle spent fuel.
They don't use it very efficiently, is all.

Recycled uranium needs re-enrichment, and because LWRs are under-moderated, the uranium-236 that formed the first time around (by non-fission capture, unavoidable in a thermal-neutron reactor) acts as a neutron poison.
So you have to enrich to, for instance, 3·3% to get the effect of 3% enrichment from mined uranium.

On the other hand, a CANDU reactor fed with uranium recovered from spent LWR fuel, containing about 1% U-235, will achieve something like 20 MWd/kg, as against roughly 7·5 MWd/kg with normal uranium.
Because of the softer neutron spectrum, the effect of U-236 is about 10× smaller, and a very small increase in initial fissile content leads to a *big* increase in burn-up and fissions per initial fissile atom.
Atucha 1 (a pressure-vessel HWR) went from 6·5 MWd/kg with normal uranium to 11 with 0·9% enrichment.
The argument can still be made that newly-enriched uranium is cheaper than reprocessed U, but to my mind, doubling the amount of energy you get from the reprocessed material makes the economics of reprocessing better.

Plutonium can also be used in LWRs or in CANDU of course, and BWRs in particular can use Pu-based fuel more efficiently in the upper, less-moderated portion of the core, which is why Japan settled on LWR-MOX rather than continuing with the Fugen type of HWR.
Nevertheless, proceeding to build at least a demonstration S-PRISM makes a huge amount of sense.
We shouldn't expect to build economical FBRs right away.
But we need to start building them anyway, in order to get the experience needed for building economical ones.

"Canada is promoting SMRs, but there is little government funding to go along to make it happen beyond concept evaluation. All the action plans, roadmaps, etc. are good for advocacy and for creating interest, but what the SMR vendors need is funding. Despite this, when you add up all the money that has been committed by Canadian federal/provincial governments, it pales in comparison with the money that the US given through DOE ARDP, GAIN, and the countless other funding opportunities. 

I say this as somebody who works in nuclear R&D in Canada who wants to see our country thrive in this area and leverage the decades of excellence in nuclear technology development. But the sad current reality is that we are expected to work on reactor technology that is still in need of major R&D with very little money.

"A refurbishment is not the same as a new build. CANDU refurbs are indeed unique in the sense that they require the construction of reactor core and other major components, which you don’t see in vessel type designs. But this is just overcoming a design limitation of the CANDU design (pressure tube creep and sag dictating an end of life), leading it to require a refurbishment to enable life extension from 30 to 60 years. Meanwhile the US and France are extending the life of their fleet from the initial 40 to 60 and then 80 years without any fanfare. 

Regarding the use of mockups: that is routine in the nuclear industry, not sure why it is worth noting that as an exceptional achievement. 

Having said all of this, the refurbishments went very well and are a testament to the Canadian nuclear industry’s excellence.

"It doesn’t really make sense with their own figures though, unless they assumed a shorter lifespan.

If you assume a 91% CF and an 80 year lifespan (maximum allowed, maybe not realistic though) you amortize the cost to something like $25/MWh + operational costs which Lazard puts at $32/MWh for a combined $57/MWh.

"There is no evidence of linear no threshold  having any validity.  People who live at high altitudes do not have higher cancer rates than people who live at low altitudes despite a higher exposure to radiation from having less atmosphere blocking solar and cosmic radiation.  Their exposure levels are safe. 

There are already radioisotopes in your body and you can't live without them.  All potassium is radioactive because it contains a radioisotope potassium-40.  All water is radioactive because it contains the radioisotope tritium, also called hydrogen-3.  All carbon is radioactive because it contains the radioisotope carbon-14.  You breathe and are constantly exposed to the radioisotope radon-222 because it simply emerges out of the earth.  

There is no validity for being scared of words like radiation, radioactive, radioisotope, etc.  We live on a radioactive planet and are exposed to safe levels of radiation.  All life is built to be able to handle it.  The radiation doses that all life received on Earth would have been higher billions of years ago than it is today.

People even expose themselves to higher than average levels of radiation as healthy practices like soaking in water from volcanic  hot springs that are more radioactive than the wastewater from nuclear power plants, going outside in bright sunlight so that the ionizing UV radiation stimulates vitamin d production in their body, immersing their bodies in radioactive monazite sand to stimulate healing, etc. 

[Dose matters and it takes a lot to clearly cause harm](https://xkcd.com/radiation/).  There are also far greater unaddressed chemical threats that should be a far greater concern than radiation.  PFAS are a clear example like the ones used in solar panels and wind turbines for weather proofing.  Weather proofing is a clear necessity when equipment is exposed to the weather.  Then there are the emissions from fossil fuels which have been horrible. 

[Here is a good reason to support nuclear power](https://xkcd.com/1162/).  So little waste gets produced for the power generated that it is possible to shield and isolate it, which is what has been done.  

If you're concerned about safety then nuclear power is the safest power source available, especially if RBMK reactors are omitted with the 30-45 deaths caused by Chernobyl accident.  PWR, BWR and CANDU reactors have an unprecedented safety record.

Linear no threshold has been tremendously damaging in blocking nuclear power's adoption through over regulation and driving up costs.

"Spent nuclear fuel contains large amounts of neutron poisons that are removed to mantain good neutron economy. Generally fuel remains in the reactor until burnup and neutron poison build up requires most of the control rods to be withdrawn or soluble poisons removed from reactor(in the case of PWR), this can cause problematic power fluctuations if i recall correctly.

Iirc, CANDU reactors typically use natural uranium, however they can use spent low enriched LWR fuel that is repurposed (mechanically, not chemically) into the correct fuel.

Using breeder reactors to produce fuel for a burner reactor would be counter intuitive, as it would lose the main advantage of breeding a self-sustaining amount of fissile material. Blanket regions from a fast reactor could conceivably be used directly in a thermal reactor, however the fuel would still probably need to be mechanically reprocessed.",r/nuclear,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhb25ISGx2X2ZkVkhkdE1lNEpsdjBjNzJpdXZUTlc1NVdtX0UxMldTRC1oX2tZN3RCd3B4a1pHdmdCb3N0a1FUaDM1MWtzcU9aSDlYNWxXVG5aSEltOEE9PQ==

"Probably the only thing that gets close to it is going to be molten salt reactors which sort of eliminate the issues with neutron poisons if you can remove them during reactor operations (i.e. venting gaseous poisons), however you're somewhat still left with chemical processing at some stage. 

Important to note that the US has never really had much of a reprocessing program and it's few ventures (e.g. Hanford) were for specific purposes but not for civil plutonium reprocessing (at least to my knowledge, I'm fairly certain on this). A more apt example would be either Magnox reprocessing plant or THORP (I don't know much about Marcoule or La Hague). I'm not quite sure what you're inferring about 'the mess' that goes with reprocessing - certainly there have been issues but, particularly with the US, a lot of those issues were due to legacy mistakes. In fact a lot of nuclear decommissioning and remediation is fixing legacy issues (which does a hell of a lot more remediation than 'conventional' toxic companies do). 

The other issue is that having an open nuclear fuel cycle means you need to do something with the plutonium you're generating, the option most, if not all, nuclear states pick is Mixed OXide (MOX) fuel. If you decide you don't want to make MOX fuel anymore then you end up sitting on a lot of plutonium which suddenly doesn't really have much of a purpose except for some niche uses and R&D feeds. I think it's a bit silly really to take a resource you have and chuck it into the ground when it can be used for new fuel but what do I know.",r/nuclear,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhT3dKZW5xTERjRzhEak1OQ3F0UGJvZGNWTFZ2cGlGQXg5SnZrQUFVN1BDdXBTYThMUTJrLUZvMkxOZkRBN2w4M3lMZ1VoTnhrczhSUktBNUhIbXNNd1E9PQ==

"> Using breeder reactors to produce fuel for a burner reactor would be counter intuitive, as it would lose the main advantage of breeding a self-sustaining amount of fissile material.

It makes sense if you work under the hypotheses that

a) the uranium resource has become scarce enough that a breeder programme is necessary

b) Building and operating LWRs is cheaper than FBRs

These were the assumptions the French nuclear programme made when they launched the Superphénix prototype, which cost about 5x more than the similarly-powered 1300 MW PWRs EDF was building at the time, 6200 €/kW vs. 1100-1300 €/kW

The idea was that for every x number of PWRs (something like 3 to 6, I can't remember exactly) which would run on MOX instead of enriched uranium, you'd have a SFR which would be generating significantly more expensive electricity, but that was acceptable because as a by-product it would ""recharge"" the plutonium that the PWRs would deplete during their fuel cycle.

The source for SPX's cost is [this presentation by the French Atomic Energy Commission at the Gen IV forum](https://www.gen-4.org/gif/upload/docs/application/pdf/2017-12/gifiv_webinar_phenix_superphenix_final_guidez.pdf), and for the PWR fleet it's [this report by the French Audit Court](https://www.ccomptes.fr/sites/default/files/EzPublish/thematic_public_report_costs_nuclear_%20power_sector_012012.pdf)",r/nuclear,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNncXo4WWQ1bjNYbXN5OFZUaTBPeU1YWW80ZmJkcnRta2x0N0pKRnl0NlB5LWs4dkM2VVhkWXNSSXcwWURGRG01OVI3TGY5TGxOaFZNTFNoVUw3aDJJWE5DVF82NEhDOVNWNjZSbHpIWlNLM1U9
"Chemical reprocessing is necessary, but not always at every step.

Already in the 1970s it was suggested that the outer breeding blanket for FBRs could be in the form of fuel assemblies suitable for use in converter reactors, fabricated from plain thorium oxide in zirconium-alloy tubes.
These assemblies would accumulate a considerable fraction of uranium-233 but very little fission products while in the FBR, then be pulled from the reactor, washed, and inserted directly into converter reactors.
They would be too hot to handle without special apparatus, but this is arguably an advantage from safeguards considerations.

The main problem with this is bad behaviour of Zr alloys in sodium above 400 °C, but the outer blanket could be kept in ""cold"" sodium below this temperature, if no other solution can be found.
Personally I suspect that some combination of alloy selection, steam pre-oxidation of the cladding (used on some LWR fuel in the 1960s), possibly plating with niobium or something similar, and hot-trapping of the sodium with zirconium foils could solve the problem.

An alternative which I have considered is using spent converter fuel assemblies in the breeding blanket, to increase the proportion of plutonium before reprocessing.
This is particularly interesting in the case of CANDU fuel.
A second benefit is the ""second chance"" (n.2n) reaction on uranium-236, which has the fascinating result that the ""depleted"" uranium in the discharged bundles ends up containing more 235 than before you put it into the breeder, making its recovery value greater.

And, of course, the IFR concept includes a small non-aqueous reprocessing facility for driver fuel at the plant site, although reprocessing of blanket fuel might need to be handled some other way.",r/nuclear,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnQ0t3a3FQWHdpYWdHMTVuZjRWaC01aEZNQ0xmLVJCVGctYkQ1SHc2QmJuZkV2TFZ4YzQyYThQU0dkVkVScnl2UENPU3BvMWlLaWxDVXNGOThOdEtWSHVBY0FoMDVzMTAybHNPajVrNGdIS1E9

"There was some work in the 1970s on a ""mixed economy"" of converters and breeders.
It makes sense in some circumstances, in particular when the converters are very neutron-efficient and use very dilute fuel, as is feasible with CANDU.
This can allow for lower overall fuel-cycle costs than a pure breeder economy, in part because of the greater ""fissions per initial fissile atom"" value in CANDU as compared to either LWR or FBR.
It also makes safeguarding the nuclear fuel cycle easier, by consolidating all breeder reactors and fuel-cycle operations on a small number of sites.

"Look at commercial plants for job openings. Apply for mechanical maintenance/tech. 

Can also apply for plant operator if you’ve got a degree (might also see it listed as operator tech, equipment operator, or auxiliary operator). Can’t hurt to apply even if you don’t have a degree.

"I will repeat what many have said: look for open mechanical maintenance jobs or facilities maintenance jobs. Honestly, look for any job with pay that you can live on, because the hardest part about getting the job you want at most nuclear power plants is getting *any* job at a nuclear power plant. Once you have your foot in the door, it is much easier to change roles to something that interests you. 

I've know people who worked their way from laborer (sweeping floors) to the mechanical maintenance shop, to become the mechanical training instructor.",r/nuclear,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnNDZsc1RSLUtuUWxvaGRlTTRjRUJfNlZpTzVzM2ZZZXNNOUtuc2h1YUZDbjhFUkZQZ251ekFVVXlFVVlrNzRqQThlNC0wdnR6V3dIZldjMTA3SUxoMXc9PQ==
