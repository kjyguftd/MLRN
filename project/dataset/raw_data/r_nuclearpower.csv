"France is leading the way in nuclear waste segregation and mid term storage, which is a big part of nuclear power. They also have a mature infrastructure for producing and disturbing the fuel.

I didn't know they'd fallen behind on reactor site development though. That makes me sad. I had doped at least France wasn't so short sited as to brain drain the skills for reactor site development.

As for France's eventual grid collapse, I was under the impression they were pretty extreme electricity exporters. Couldn't they throttle that back if needed?


Edit:

This got me thinking if France isn't building more reactors how is their power consumption changing over the last few decades. I found the iea.org site (I only did light vetting, please let me know if they're a known bad source).

First something goofy happened in 2022. France's electricity consumption dropped a lot and their imports jumped past their exports for the first time... ever?

So ignoring the oddity of 2022, France exports about 20% of their nuclear power generation. They seem to be replacing nuclear dependence primarily with nat gas, but recently they started with wind.

At their current rate France has another 100 years before wind generation could replace nuclear. So yeah France had better get on the ball and build some new 50 yr  reactors.",r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYXzR4dERMeHlGTEZkSHZ5Ql8tZERGM01DNDVEbzk2djNQQTlIZzBYQnhfeVVlbnY0VVdtZFkwRzJXZmFIVTNxZ2xKMVFmY09hUzhNYkFzeUZqZW1wd0E9PQ==
"[Betz law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betz%27s_law) (which is what I linked) is the theoretical limit on how much energy an airfoil can capture out of a moving air stream.

It is the corollary to the [Carnot's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnot%27s_theorem_(thermodynamics\\)) for thermal engines. 

For off-shore wind the current 14-18 MW plants being built the announced capacity factors by the manufacturers are ~60-65%.

What is forgotten in that figure is that we choose the capacity factor by the ratio between the swept area, in other words Betz law, and the generator size.

Stick a 0.1 MW generator in what is today sold as a 15 MW wind turbine and it will generate a near 100% capacity factor, but you also won't capture much of the available energy.

For the Swedish grid the grid operator did that calculation, and found that a 100% renewable grid with hydro, imports and demand response can handle the case. 

Add storage and it becomes easy. Given current deployment rates California will have ~400 GWh of battery storage in 20 years, so your worry will with near certainty be solved.",r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYemdvZkNQd2lROVl6dVNPdVdzSEFERkpfU1h2QUs0aE5GOXZmdDE0U0dVOWRDZmdwRnhEQlFzdU95Y3ZkMGdkZWZMLXlVdTRLaE5Wb3BoenhkQU9FTHc9PQ==

> Between 2007 and 2009, 13 companies applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for construction and operating licenses to build 31 new nuclear power reactors in the United States. However, the case for widespread nuclear plant construction has been hampered due to inexpensive natural gas, slow electricity demand growth in a weak US economy, lack of financing, and safety concerns following the Fukushima nuclear accident at a plant built in the early 1970s which occurred in 2011.[3][4]

> Most of the proposed 31 reactors have been canceled, and as of August 2017 only two reactors are under construction.[5][6][7][8] In 2013, four reactors were permanently closed: San Onofre 2 and 3 in California following equipment problems, Crystal River 3 in Florida, and Kewaunee in Wisconsin.[9][10] Vermont Yankee, in Vernon, was closed on Dec. 29, 2014.

> In March 2017, the last remaining U.S.-based new nuclear company, Westinghouse Electric Company, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy because of US$9 billion of losses from its U.S. nuclear construction projects.[11][12] Later that year construction of two reactors of their AP1000 design at V.C. Summer was canceled due to delays and cost overruns[8] raising questions about the future of the two remaining US reactors under construction, since these are also of the AP1000 design.[13]

"The real issue is relative cost.  And not cost today, but relative costs 10 years from now.

For example, if you started work on a nuclear reactor today, between regulatory requirements and construction times, it won’t be operational for ten years.  If it is being compared to, say, solar and/or wind feeding a utility scale battery, then the nuclear plant needs to be economically competitive with the cost of the solar/wind plus batteries ten years from now.  Since these costs have been dropping over the last ten years, it is tricky to predict what the costs will be ten years from now.

When a utility is looking at a multi billion dollar investment that won’t pay off for a decade, it doesn’t want to be in the position of trying to sell power against a competitor that has a significantly lower cost of construction and operation.  That uncertainty is a significant problem.",r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYc3cwUVJmWXZPNlFrTm02bTVjWVVvWXF0QXF1Y0V5QnFOUG1fZ3A4dWdJSnladWdrc2Q0bUlFZjNyWFFueGxOdXdPOEFUNFUtUjk3eHhRMnlNc1dYUHc9PQ==

Have a look at major infrastructure projects around the world. We are bad at pulling them off. This is not unique to nuclear by any stretch.

"The military aspirations thing has a shred of truth but power reactors aren't needed to build nuclear weapons. That's a strawman against nuclear power we should light on fire. If a country wants to build nuclear weapons they will do it with or without commercial power reactors - see Iran/DPRK. Closing Pandora's box isn't going to happen by building or not building commercial power reactors.

Yeah, nuclear in Australia likely doesn't make much or any sense from my distant view. However, in Canada where I reside it makes a lot more sense in some areas. Just like in the southwest US, you have tons of accessible and open land with terrific solar resource - it'd be wise to focus on solar in those regions.

In the past I've worked through solar resource assessments in Canada and there are large regions where solar should be heavily pursued like Alberta and Saskatchewan. Similar story for wind. In places like Ontario you are contending with less overall solar irradiation that makes the payback on unsubsidized solar tenuous. Renewables were getting built like crazy when the government was offering heavily subsidized rates but very little is getting built since the subsidies have dried up. Investors are speaking with their wallets, which tells much of the story at the moment. I'm much less knowledgeable of the US situation.

Yep, which is why the reddit boner for nuclear does not make sense, and given current costs the only niche it is viable in is nuclear submarines. Even [naval surface vessels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear-powered_cruisers_of_the_United_States_Navy) have been moving away from nuclear since the 80s with only the aircraft carriers being left.

"Any military/gvmt is going to find a way to create weapons grade uranium/plutonium with or without a commercial plant. As a counterexample, being a Canadian in Canada, there is a robust industry that is focused purely on power production and improving healthcare with nuclear science. Canada will never have a nuclear weapon. It may be true in some or many cases that Military ambitions will influence the building of commercial power reactors but that doesn't need to be true. If it is true and it amounts to a net social benefit as a low carbon energy source then whats the issue if military was going to find a way to enrich fuel anyways? Climate change is the real and most present issue. Are we losing the plot?

The argument goes both ways. The social media nukebros and renewabros is very polarized and many probably haven't even stepped foot in either industry. The viewpoints seem to be all nuclear or no nuclear. Renewables either very good or very bad. There is little room for rationale and moderate conversation.

"I guess you missed the second paragraph? Half the military side is nuclear weapons, the other half is naval reactors powering mainly submarines.

Those require the same industry, like the one canada has.

The problem is that renewables and nuclear does not match, as renewable penetration increases simply by virtue of being the cheapest energy source around nuclear power is pushed out of the grid.

Given current cost structures and outcomes of nuclear projects there is no ""investing in both"". Investing in renewables will make any nuclear power plant projects started today dead on arrival.

"Well, I was working for a Canadian telecoms company at the time, so my experience is unlikely to be very useful other than generalities, but...

For grid operators, there's only EirGrid, so you might want to peruse their job listings too. ESB is the largest plant operator, and I suspect they'll have jobs very similar to an RO, but those plants will be de-emphasized as they shift to renewables.

The existing grid is mostly coal and peat and since I was there a lot of new gas as well. There's got to be jobs at these plants that will be super-similar to an RO role. These are spread across the country, so geography is not really limiting you. You can [have a look at this list which is pretty complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_power_stations_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland).

But the real story is their wind buildout. They're adding about 1 to 2% of their total capacity every year in new wind. They have not even really begun to tap their offshore capacity, and there are *huge* resources around Sligo, Galway Bay, Dingle Bay and the Shannon estuary that can plug right into the existing coal-fired transmission network from locations like Tarbert, Moneypoint and Tawnaghmore. My feeling is that will be mostly west coast, although even Dublin Bay is pretty shallow and they'll likely be studying that too.

So, my question back; what are *you* looking for in a new location? I absolutely loved the west coast, but I'm a bit of an introvert and the slower pace really fit me well. Any town above 10k is more like what you would see in a small city here, so I was in Ennis which is like 25k people and found it fun and lively ""downtown"" while still being a quiet town at night.

But if you're looking for more action, Dublin is 40% of the entire county (and thus eye wateringly expensive) so that has to be an option, but you can also look to Cork (225k) and especially Galway which had an absolutely *fantastic* nightlife for a population of 80k. Here in Canada a town of 80k has a couple of eateries trying to be fancy and some totally cookie-cutter pubs trying to pretend they're British.

> However if they're being untrustworthy in the title, thumbnail, and introduction; how can you trust the rest of the material in the video?

Eh, this feels kinda misguided when considering the algorithm, no? This feels like saying, *""if I ask a stranger how they're doing and they respond 'good,' but they're actually depressed, then how can I trust anything they say?""* Does that sound like a statement you'd stand by, or do you see some underlying absurdity behind the logic? I'd argue this logic overlooks an innocent and generic ""game"" that we all play by, which is generally irrespective to our actual integrity.

To answer the question bluntly, you can't and shouldn't trust *any* information that *anyone* tells you. If you *ever* graduate a soft opinion to a hard opinion, you ought to verify it (beyond mere hearsay, to some reasonable extent) yourself to justify that weight. It shouldn't matter if someone makes their Youtube thumbnail a picture of their tax forms and their messy bedroom--such apparent honesty doesn't mean you can therefore trust what they say. Likewise, if someone makes a thumbnail with their mouth wide open but they're not actually surprised, you also can't just dismiss everything they say. These would make for silly heuristics.

I don't think Kyle playing to the standard, ho-hum Youtube algorithm, such by rather trivial clickbait, somehow puts into any meaningful questioning of the information he gives. I don't see this as a logically compelling point to raise. The two just don't seem connected in any realistic way.

The better question would be, is there anything in Kyle's content about science and nuclear power that you've found inaccurate? If so, that oughtta be acknowledged and discussed, as I'd be curious.

Well no, nuclear plants produce power. Since you are educated you must know they do more than jack shit. It's just expensive and we are apparently bad at it.

At least in Ontario, there were huge amounts of public money pumped into incentives to get renewables built. Until recently, there have been no notable incentives provided to the nuclear industry for a very long time.

There are many green and technological incentives funded by the public purse in Canada and USA. Public-private partnerships can be a good tool to spur innovation and are often needed to help private capital take on risk. Not sure if you recall Musk speaking out against federal subsidies a couple years ago. But when he did it then came out that his companies have received billions of federal dollars, including SpaceX.

"In a western PWR design, when water is replaced by steam in the primary circuit (for example in the case of a breach), the core is no longer cooled AND the neutrons are no longer moderated - because steam is a worse coolant and moderator than liquid water. Because the neutrons are no longer moderated (slowed down), reactivity is reduced without intervention. Also, higher fuel temperature (due to coolant loss) has an adverse effect on reactivity (this is called the Doppler effect).

That's why a PWR design is safer than a RBMK, because if for any reason liquid water stops being fed to the core, the reactor ""stops"" by itself very quickly. You still have to deal with radioactive decay heat in your fuel though, so you have to find a way to resume cooling the core after some time.",r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMEZVUlk0OGVFM3lSUENzVEJfQ3JRVmhZNHVpdDgxeGVPMEtKNW5YRVNBMlItTjA0SU9YTDFFN2o4T3dxdDVyR3NKR3Uzb2pCMml3RjF0T2NVd3NiZnc9PQ==

">Wait, so in the absence of a moderator, the reactor goes subcritical?

Exactly. Moderating the neutrons (slowing them down) is in fact what allows the fission reaction to be possible. U235, which is the most commonly used fuel in reactor designs, will only capture and fission with ""slow neutrons"" (neutrons that have encountered a moderator - water, graphite).
You ""moderate"" the speed of the neutrons to make the fission chain reaction possible.

Even a higher temperature of the water in PWRs (without it becoming steam) is enough to reduce reactivity, because higher temperature -> lower density -> less moderation.

By the way, fast neutron reactors are another type of reactor designs that don't rely on moderation, because they do not use U235.",r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNacUp0RTlwaHowd1h2WTNwdVhXQmpKdEJRbDRpRzhXVUpCMEszcXoxbm9GeGl6ak1JOGh6YlhOclY3V3IzNWpYamVlMHpoZG1Gcm5jWjZUX2NONy1oTkE9PQ==

"The coolant is the moderator in PWRs and BWRs. More moderation generally means more reactivity, so the more energy the fuel adds to the coolant the hotter it gets, the less dense it gets (either via sub cooled heating or boiling), the less moderation there is, the less reactivity there is.

It is a self correcting system. So if you want to raise power, you can withdraw control rods, which removes a little bit of the neutron absorber from the core, which overall adds reactivity to the core, which causes more fissions, which adds heat, which raises the temperature of the fuel, which raises the temperature of the coolant, which lowers in density due to hotter water or steam, which reduces moderation of the coolant/moderator, which lowers reactivity, which lowers fissions, which reduces heat, which lowers the temp of the fuel, which lowers the temp of the coolant/moderator, which raises in density due to cooler water or less steam, etc...

No, these two are contradictory because in a PWR, water is *both* the coolant and the moderator.

First of all, fuel temperature and coolant/moderator (assuming PWR) temperature must be considered separately.

Fuel temperature coefficient is always negative, ie. hotter fuel -> lower fuel density -> less fission.

As I have explained, in a PWR, lower moderator density -> less moderation -> less fission.

And because water is both moderator and coolant, higher coolant temp -> lower moderator density -> less moderation ->  less fission.

So the temperature coefficients of core materials tend to be negative.

Also, higher fuel temperature increases the probability of the neutron being absorbed by non-fissile U238, decreasing reactivity.

">less cooling -> even greater core temperature -> more fission reactions.

Not quite, because higher fuel temperature also has an adverse effect on reactivity with standard U235 fuel (this is called the ""Doppler effect""). It is less significant than the effect of moderator temperature, but still helps you in an accident.

In a classic reactivity accident, not taking safety measures like control rods into account, you will have the following:
For whatever reason, the reactor goes supercritical -> the temperature of the water rises, so its density gets lower, and the moderation of neutrons is reduced + the fuel temperature rises, so less neutrons are captured by U235 for fission -> the reactivity is reduced, ending the criticality event.

All of this happening in a few ms, faster than any human operator can react.

"You’re using the term “supercritical” incorrectly. Any time you raise reactor power, once the reactor is brought to critical, it’s “supercritical”. A reactor being critical just means that net losses of neutrons are exactly made up for by the gains from fissions. 

In a western PWR, the moderator and coolant are both water. As water heats up the water molecules get further from each other, this causes a neutron to have to travel further before it is thermalized or “moderated”. So more neutrons escape the core and power goes down. For a short time, following a refueling outage, western PWRs can have a zero or positive temperature coefficient.

The RBMK design is much different, the coolant in the channels does perform some moderation, but the graphite surrounding the fuel assemblies is responsible for performing that task. So as the water in the coolant channels heats up, more neurons make it to the moderator and get thermalized. This causes power to rise.

"You have a pretty decent understanding of the basic concepts, but I think are slightly off in a few concepts. 

To simplify (I'm sure you don't need it, but it's easier to explain) increased moderation increases the amount of thermalized neutrons in the core, thus increasing the probably that a neutron will interact with a U235 atom and cause a fission.  So, as moderation goes up, so does power. 

When a PWR begins to boil, you are replacing the water (good moderator) with steam (bad moderator).  This is why PWRs have a negative void coefficient, because voids cause power to go down.  

This same phenomenon also occurred at Chernobyl, in their water.  But that's had minimal effect as the graphite is their primary moderator and is unaffected by the increase in voids.  If anything, this means more water molecules made it to the graphite, rather than just getting absorbed by water, also leading to an increase in power.

"You seem to be confusing the purpose of the moderator. Moderators slow neutrons to increase the likelihood that they interact with the core. This process is what turns fast neutrons into thermal neutrons which have a larger neutron absorption cross section. 

As you've pointed out, in an RBMK the graphite moderator is unaffected by heat, while the effect of the coolant water is reduced. Thus, as heat increases so does reactivity, giving you a positive void coefficient. In a PWR/BWR, voids in the water would theoretically reduce the reactors cooling ability, but voids also reduce its moderating effects. This means fewer neutrons are being slowed down, which means the neutrons being created spend less time in the core. This reduces the probability that they interact with the core and leads to a decrease in reactor power. Thus, PWR/BWRs have a negative void coefficient of reactivity.",r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRFJMZ1BkeGJRa2dYT05BSzNoWUhfVnFXUHFjNG14bkFWX0pDZm5BendFY0pVclRqc0ozNUhhQkc5RFFjdHBidU9yV3ZlWlZKUmYwMU1FdWRENnlNb3c9PQ==
"A better way to think about void coefficient impact on reactivity in PWRs vs the old VVERs is a difference in fuel pin pitch.

Each neutron requires an average amount of collisions (~10-20) with the hydrogen in water to slow down to thermal speeds for re-absorption to propagate more chain reactions…

The pitch (spacing) in all US designs was tuned so that the necessary collisions (on average would not happen) and the neutron population naturally decreases ‘breaking’ Keff (to <1) and naturally lowering power levels.

Russian fuel lattice pitch did not take advantage of this spacing orientation. As the moderator escaped, the ‘voids’ provided enough moderator left to slow neutrons to thermal range which in turn increased neutron capture and overall reactor activity.

"Neutrons are “born” with too much energy / moving too fast to cause fission. The purpose of the moderator is to give them something to help them bounce around in and slow down to lose that excess energy. 

A moderator is a material that has a low neutron absorption rate. 

Without the moderator, the neutrons are moving too fast. They will either leak out of the core in higher amounts, or they will get absorbed in other ways and not cause fission. If a neutron gets absorbed by fuel and is moving too fast, it likely will not cause a fission. 

For our light water reactors, the water is both a coolant and a moderator. In a BWR, we actually control reactor power by changing the void fraction. If I raise the cooling flow rate in the core, power goes up. If I lower it, power goes down. If a reactor coolant pump trips, power rapidly drops because the core voids out, and it will stabilize at a lower power level where the nautral cooling of the core is equal to the power production. 
During scram failure scenarios, there are situations where we may actually uncover the core intentionally to lower power as much as possible, reducing cooling down to the minimum safe level which in turn reduces power, which buys time other mechanisms to scram the core or inject boron.",r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRzAzMW5pVl9IYVROUTNlQ1oxRTdubE5YVFJITjhQcDBZOEIyam42WS0wTnpkZnV0WkQ0LURSWGtrLWdkRDJEYzVxQlFRNG9UWEpld0JxT1lNZkFSZmc9PQ==

"Two important parts to consider.  A BWR uses water as both moderator and cooling.  Voids are steam bubbles forming and growing.  The energy (heat) removed from water’s transition from liquid to steam is significantly larger than a simple degree change.  So cooling is actually increased by the formation of these voids.
Water is the moderator in a BWR.  Moderation is the collision of neutrons (fast) with the water transferring kinetic energy into thermal energy (heat) and slowing down to a lower energy that is more likely to interact with fuel.  As water heats up it becomes less dense.  Less dense moderator is less effective at moderating since there is more space between the water molecules.  Once voids begin to form into steam bubbles a significant, large, increase occurs in the spacing of the water molecules reducing the likelihood of neutrons interacting and thus slowing the reaction.
Recirculating pumps flow water through the core at a controlled rate sweeping the voids along and providing control.

In the RBMK design the graphite continues to moderate just as effectively regardless of the cooling water condition.  So the void formation doesn’t slow down the reactor (negative feedback).  The design actually has a positive feedback requiring operator action for control.  This positive feedback means the reactor is unstable and an increase in power causes an increase in temperature which causes an increase in power in a loop.  Uncontrolled the coolant flash boils into a steam explosion.  This steam is not nuclear itself.  The steam explosion blew the lid off the core and ejected nuclear material from the core.

The issue is when you want to use fuel that is mostly U-238. Intermediate-energy neutrons are likely to be absorbed by U-238. This breeds plutonium for later, but without enough immediate fissions, chain reaction is not sustained. 

The solution is having the neutrons leave the fuel rod to spend the intermediate energy period in the water moderator, where they slow down to equilibrium low “thermal” energy. (If light water, some are absorbed by hydrogen.) 

Then when slow neutrons encounter fuel again, they ignore U-238 but fission U-235.

What if the water density becomes much lower? More of the neutrons aren’t fully slowed, and get absorbed by U-238.

"Wait, that would refewr to WIMPs, that is Weak Interacting Massive Particles. Maybe you *could* beat some real energy out of those, but the issue, why they are *DARK* in the first place is the ***Weakly Interacting*** part. That means, being literally untouchable. Something like Neutrinos, but superheavy. That also means you cannot contain them and cannot concentrate them. So the first part for theis Sci-Fi is still missing.

"you would need to construct a manipulator out of condensed dark matter, there would have to be something else than the WIMPs to grab them and focus them. Or something at least to synchronously deflect them in a manner of directing them into a tiny spot and at the exact same moment these particles collide, stop, reflect or interact, launch another reaction in the same space of our material world.

Since we had changed the issue from handling to just deflecting, we have some experience os that in the dielectric missors/lenses we use to detect neutrinos.

There would have to be a sophisticated 3D design to somehow focus the WIMPS, but... what size would it require? Or, maybe, we could generate superheavy WIMPs that would deflect in the WIMP soup?

While the WIMPs are not interacting... are those perceptive to something? Just because those are not physically interacing, do they have a spin or any other parameter that can be changed? Maybe with some sequencing we could run these non-interacting particles against each other to manifest themselves somehow? Do exclusivity laws work with WIMPs? Maybe we could crowd the dark space with all combinations of spins UP/DOWN etc, intil one wimp has no chance of staying and it pops up to our material plane?

Given the fact a new president comes around every 4-8 years (each with their own idea of what NASA should be doing), I highly doubt it will get done.

I lost confidence in NASA over a decade ago when I realized its actually a jobs program instead of a Space Program.

"I think the magic piece of the puzzle you might be missing has to do with what's called nuclear cross sections.  It turns out that U235 doesn't like to fission with just *any* old neutron.  In fact, the overall result when a neutron loves a uranium atom isn't random, it's determined by a number of competing phenomena, like fission, resonance capture, absorption, etc, all of which can be studied by way of analyzing the cross sections.  Ultimately what this means for U235 is that the uranium is much more likely to fission when the neutrons colliding with it are thermal neutrons.  Fast neutrons can technically cause fission, but it's significantly rarer.

So, if we use this knowledge to think about how we actually control reactors, we can understand what is happening in a light water reactor when voids rise.  The most direct way to curtail a nuclear reaction is to shove some control rods (usually boron, or hafnium, or some other poison) right into the middle of things and let them soak up all the neutrons.  If the rods soak up the neutrons, they aren't around to cause fission, and negative reactivity is added.  That part is easy...

But what if I don't exactly soak up the neutrons, and instead I just prevent them from slowing down?  Unlike the control rods, the neutrons are still out and about, *but*, if they aren't thermalizing then they aren't likely to cause fission, and therefore *like* control rods negative reactivity has been added.  So, if I turn the water to steam and make a void, there's significantly less water molecules near the fuel and therefore significantly less moderating, and therefore significant negative reactivity.  That's basically all there is to it!",r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnNHFtOC03NnRsWUlVeEJTR25YSFhJTDNQRURQRHFnN0pVX25yQjdnLUFqVWJMU1Bva1B6N2t2OXo0elNBaGhuN0RuTHlxeGJsbEM5SlZBcHN5OVBSTHc9PQ==

"Cynical? You DO realize that MILLIONS of people have WILLINGFULLY died in the past to make lives of next generation better? So is that cynical or inspiring - they way it is SUPPOSED to be? 

Nuclear is not there to kill people as you believe - it is there to get cheaper energy leading to better lives of hundreds of thousands of their peers and children. Liquidators in Chernobyl were there not because KGB had guns up their back as you see in HBO adaptation. 99% of them genuinely wanted to help their country. Many purposefully overstay dangerous area to help just a little more. They were heroes - not coward bureaucrats or politics hiding behind value of single life while condemning thousands.

They continue to pump in Fukushima not because they have to - simply because they were told to - mistakenly. Everything in Fukushima is buried not in radioactive debris, but in loads of politicians crap. 

A lot of things happen ""to"" and ""in"" our minds. A lot more should happen ""in"" and a lot less ""to"" it. It's everybody own choice. 

""Rosatom continue to process"" is not the same as ""Karachay lakes keep multipliyng"". Yes, they DO take nuclear waste from elsewhere. But it does not mean they just dumping them into random lakes - that part is western media invention.
