"> if it is advanced I might not understand some things 

I understand that discomfort is, well, uncomfortable, but if you listen to a video and understand everything the first time, you're probably not learning very much.  I'd encourage you to switch your mindset to get used to challenging yourself.  Whenever you're learning a new topic, whether in undergrad, grad school, or professional life, it's common to encounter new and unknown things and to need to step away from your book/video and look up definitions or new concepts.  Getting comfortable with that process will make you far more effective in the long run.

"Where is this figure from? Hard to say without that. If it's at 40 degrees west, is this the Brazilian continental shelf? This would be a western boundary, one that is not typically associated with the coastal wind-driven upwelling like that found in eastern boundary upwelling systems. That said, there are definitely important upwelling signals in western boundary currents (see, e.g., [Liao et. al., 2022](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021JC017649)), in addition to eddies always being a possible influence.

The reason the surface isotherms aren't really outcropped is hard to say. It is common to see an elevated pycnocline with depressed isopycnals above it (e.g., [Eddy pumping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_pumping)). Surface heating also probably plays a role.

"Hello, sorry for taking so long to get back! I did not know about eddy pumping, I went over the mechanism and that's most likely the reason for the profile above (which is from the Brazilian coast, I should've mentioned that - my bad!) as the paper mentions that there's a cyclonic eddy at the location that enhances upwelling (I had no idea the presence of the eddy would change the way upwelling occurs, so cool!) This really helped, thank you so much!

I went through the stuff I was reading because I remembered a paper where stratification was given as the reason for a profile like that:

One such cold-core vortex is situated at the center of the cyclone track before the cyclone (figure [4](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12040-021-01660-9#Fig4)a), which is also evident through the vertical section's observation along the path. Figure [10](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12040-021-01660-9#Fig10)(b) shows the upwelling of isotherms at the center of the cold-core eddy and the subsidence of isotherms at the eddy's peripheral. But this upwelling could not reach the surface and it has been suppressed below 50 m. This is due to the strong stratification in the top layers, which strongly inhibits the subsurface waters to mix with surface layers. 

from the following paper: [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12040-021-01660-9](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12040-021-01660-9)

what do they mean by upwelling can't reach the surface because of high stratification? i don't really understand what stratification has got to do with the upwelling process other than changing the vertical gradients of substances. Is this related to the eddy?

"although i've yet to read a paper, based on your description, my thought on this will be density. If i recall this correctly, stratification on the ocean occurs because of water density, due to the effects of temperature and salinity.  In this case, the there's a strong separation from the top and bottom layer. As the upwelling event occurs, the movement of cold water to the top side isn't able to break this layering, and rather just a relatively slow diffusion process starts. I usually think of internal waves when thinking about density, like this example : https://youtu.be/39Av1dp-esQ   .",r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNaldqWjJGRmlLQ1BZVkpSTVNHTnotelp0azNxMzhmZW16UEp0WVdZRkRuOFp2aWRkQXlOektueUhIMlVTbTl6S1pabFRyWFAtd0JUck1WNW4xVXRzTHc9PQ==

"One thing I've learned since starting my PhD is that every mental picture we have is too simplistic in some way. That doesn't mean they're not useful, just that we should be aware of the limitations.

In the case of a highly stratified layer preventing further upwelling, continuity is just fine. In typical upwelling, eventually the water reaches the surface and has to convert a vertical velocity into a horizontal one such that ∇ • u = 0. There's no reason this can't happen below a layer of water instead of below a layer of air.

It should also be noted that, while we often make the Boussinesq approximation for simplicity, there is a dρ/dt term in the continuity equation as well. So if an upwelled water parcel is significantly changing its density (could be due to surface heating or mixing), then continuity can be satisfied even if ∇ • u ≠ 0.",r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNdGg0NnpEeXhodDczNTB2MExFcWpWUUc2cUtZWXIzNllVUXBoM0tUVmRDeklsNWtBMXI4aC1faFB3NS1PV2MxQ1VHVFRNUGcwLXZVWVgxRTJINkRIb2c9PQ==

Yes. There are tides and the signal propagates up the river at the shallow water wave speed = the square root of gravity times the average water depth.

"For earth-like conditions,  fast currents would be near the western boundaries of each of the ocean basins and these would be red arrows flowing poleward in each hemisphere; in the center of your map, the ""tropics"", the flow would be to west (left) due to the trade winds;  your southernmost current is good.",r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQNVhLU3QzWWI4QUJvYXE1ejJ0TnBkS01pWE9ZUldmVnd4d1hBenF4UVBaWEpvOVQtNzZQWld1VV9KTEFOSW51UVNFTi1Bc0pKUmo5TDZQRzI3ZUdqOWc9PQ==
"A thing to think about with currents is that they aren't linear like the lap suggests, there are shallow surface currents and there are deeper ones too. In general you would see something like this:

- Superficial surface currents mostly driven by winds and tides. These don't have a major role in the movement of water on the ocean scale, but are super important for shipping. From a fantasy world view, you might want to look up ""trade winds"" and ""doldrums"" as this would affect where coastal trade cities are and how dragons migrate.

- Then you have your shallower currents. Generally this is warm water moving towards the poles, or cool water from the poles moving towards the equator in shallower seas. This might be important for shallow water kingdoms like merfolk. Eg. In South Africa where I live.The difference in a warm current on our East and cool one to the west has major impact on biodiversity, so I could imagine this influencing the kinds of underwater kingdoms one might encounter.

- Lastly, you have the deep currents. This is when cooler, saltier water sinks. It's usually because salt becomes concentrated in the water when ice forms, so you tend to get this forming at the poles and moving outwards. I think you could do something cool here, eg. Treat the polar currents like gateways into deeper aybssal ocean kingdoms.

Overall, I think your map seems reasonable. The only major change I would add is to remember that the word is round, so your currents needs to extent out the sides of the map. I'd use my advice above to rather not points of interest rather than make the map overcomplicated.",r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQcDB0VUYxWmZsa3BTU1daQWs1dXN3SHFpazNWVHFnYWFXLXJMekpxSGZfMFZHQWZwQ25kbFRwdm5ORHVsQU1oRGNVUzhDMm40U2hZeUZfYnRzTm5Camc9PQ==
"One thing in my mind is that Earth has strong western boundary currents (Gulf Stream, Agulhas current, Kuroshio current), ultimately caused by the location and wind direction of the westerlies and easterlies. A planet of roughly the same size and rotation would show the same behaviour, to some extent independent of the continent shapes.

Ocean currents in palaeoclimatological scenarios are probably quite close examples for what you want.

"I'm assuming this is a ""cylindrical"" like projection, so the left and right side of your map are connected, right?

Another question, all your currents are surface currents, right? 

Well, what I would say is that in general, if you have a rotating planet, you will get large scale gyres. Basically, in the ocean basins you get circular currents with the strongest currents along the western boundary. This is called western intensification. Although this depends a bit on the depth of the ocean. 

In the southern and northern polar oceans you'd probably get a strong current going all the way around the planet from west to east, like the Antarctic circumpolar current.",r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQcmNIYkJzT2o2V2NmZnluay1fMFJmdzB4RHNBcTdGZWFsR1ZCdlFKclhtS0t3WFhxeEpVaUpOQzdDSlVuX3hfajZYT3piNVhpWFJaZHBfNWtQMV83U2c9PQ==

Might be a nice bit of ambiance inspiration for any deep sea settings.

And other really cool real-world thing to look up are the scars on sperm whales - basically battle scars from their fights with giant squids in the deep ocean (yes, it's as epic as it sounds).

"The ""general movement"" is given by geostrophy; the balance of wind stress and the coriolis force. In basins that are restricted zonally (east -west) this will lead to gyres. Unrestricted it will form a continuous current circling the planet at a fixed latitude, similar to the jetstream in the atmosphere.

"Yep - all I was gonna add is the idea of gyres.  

Maybe keep in mind that, if the planet rotates slowly like Earth, there will be right hand twist to sea and air currents in the northern hemisphere, and LH twist in the S hemisphere.  If the planet rotates more quickly, that effect (Coriolis) will be more pronounced.  

It is why Jupiter has many complex bands in its atmosphere, compared to Venus, which really only has 1 in each hemisphere.  Jupiter is huge and has like a 9-hr day, whereas Venus has a day that is almost as long as its year.

"This specific image was generated using the Lange et al. approach - https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.398127. This algorithm is owned by NASA so could be implemented right away, compared to other algorithms that still need intensive testing and development before broader global application. 

Historically, ocean color PCC algorithm development has been limited by the amount of paired, quality-controlled in situ hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance data + PCC data available in the surface ocean, which isn’t enough. Hopefully with the advent of PACE and work by the PACE validation science team (https://www.pace.oceansciences.org/pvstdoi.htm), there will be enough paired data to develop improved approaches for application in more & different ecosystems. ",r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZbkRRZWd5M3RNajZWTkF4SW9LVk8yT1VyM1ZFaXZDT2Q3blZFZzBnS1JUMDJHOC0tSU5DbFdVbURuc000eWZPdHotTEFNTnRncUpYNDJ3RUdOUE1Ub0E9PQ==

"Hi there!! I also LOVE oceanography and marine biology so I’ve been doing a more “desirable” major and then my minor is oceanography. 

Currently my major is in medical biophysics with a minor in oceanography. The reason I say this is because if you love math, physics, and chemistry i honestly think biophysics is a great major as it combines those and biology!

I know there are some great ocean physics majors at NASA but I’d assume those are hard to get. A lot of government jobs need researchers with a background in oceanography, physics, math, etc. 

My best advice is to find a major you’d take interest in and is “useful” and then do a minor in oceanography.

I hope this helps! I’m sorry it’s not totally on topic and I rambled a bit lol",r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaUGNKdFJ1cDRRYW1LYTMxRVhYN0JWdHdrc1BiUkdfaG5oNExfdHZ6ckhBdzZNY2dEQ0NRcllucy11VzBDVGFMNTFSeEFWbTlrSmJBWHBfVjkzdG5xZ1E9PQ==

"I’m in a similar position, I’m doing civil engineering in college right now with the goal of getting into coastal engineering. They use ocean physics models to simulate storm surge flooding, sea level rise, erosion and other coastal fluid mechanics stuff (along with using autocad and excel to do normal engineering stuff). I’m probably going to try to get an oceanography phd and go into coastal oceanography research after a 4 or 5 years in engineering but I want to have a fallback because oceanography jobs seem scarce compared to engineering. ",r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaOEgySUIzTzFkYVFIMi1Zc2lZNWFudDd2eE9SWmJSaHZiTi1xNS1hankzVmFiTzNjeF9MX09QNGN1UW5mWkdFVlRUc3NINFFoVERlT0FldG9aeHlhU01vdVV4Vl9DelFTYWlyZzF1ZWVmYm89
"Oceanography would be a great place for you! You could do something related to programming autonomous oceanographic instruments that float around ocean currents and measure different oceanographic properties. There’s also programming related to computer simulations that we run to model what the oceans were like in the past and what they will be like in the future as the climate changes. There’s also stuff you could do related to satellite measurements of oceanographic properties. Oceanography is such a big and multi-disciplinary field that people come into with all kinds of different backgrounds. 

I’d start by checking out things related to physical oceanography, that tends to be a very computer heavy part of the field!",r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaR1RWUTNScDRsaV9SM0lxRFF5LUhacUFqWEhJcFJYek5ZZm5tc0JBMVp3NHk5bnU2SC1oaGlOZTEtRDFVSFFHd081MFhLdnhfZGlyRUVFSHpzeWJJLVE9PQ==

"I've worked for a couple different oceanography organizations/labs and one thing everyone is looking for right now are good engineers. I have a bachelor's and master's in mechanical engineering but I built my masters thesis around my interests in oceanography and mainly worked with oceanography professors. If you want to do oceanography and also make a liveable wage, engineering is the way to go. I do data analysis and publish papers so I get to do the research part as well as all the field work and sensor integration which I personally find fun. If you're in the US, UC San Diego has a great engineering department and also Scripps Oceanography. University of Washington is also a great school that does great oceanography and has ties to NOAA. There's also tons of oceanography work in the Great Lakes region, so University of Michigan, Michigan Tech, University of Wisconsin, etc. University of Michigan is one of the best engineering schools in the US and has a specific degree focused on marine engineering and they also have ties to NOAA",r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNabU96YUI2cGdGdVdiVnp2Z0dzcXB0Si03NFR3aWdMX3BJRVNST1REZGpvckVJZGxBeEhRc0kxUXVZN211M3NrTHUwUjU3MHUyOTBkWGhhNm9iUDdOT3c9PQ==
