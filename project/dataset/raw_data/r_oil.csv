"That's BS. The overwhelming majority of the funds going to Ukraine aren't actually going to Ukraine. They're going to US arms manufacturers that are restocking US stockpiles. The older stuff goes there first and then we refill our stockpiles. This stimulates the economy, sends billions of dollars back into the US economy.

The rebuilding money will ideally come from Russia. When a country attacks another country and loses the war, most of the time, the offending country is on the hook for rebuilding costs. Then, of course, the EU countries have pledged boatloads of cash as well. 

Given the Ukrainian history of depending on Russia heavily for their imports, it will be the US and EU that end up filling that vacuum and benefiting much more than we spend up front. 

Isolationism is a fool's game. Modern America was built on the spoils of the 1st and 2nd world wars and the resulting alliances produced nearly a century of economic dominance.

Putin himself is to blame.

"As long as the lease is held by production, there is not a lot you can do. You can contact the Kansas Oil and Gas Commission about the status of the inactive wells and see if some of them are past due to be plugged. You can also pester  your representative at the state level and see if there is something they can do. 

There is no law to share the information of the wells, however, the status of the wells should be available on the  [https://www.kcc.ks.gov/oil-gas](https://www.kcc.ks.gov/oil-gas) .

  
You can use [https://maps.kgs.ku.edu/oilgas/index.html](https://maps.kgs.ku.edu/oilgas/index.html) to look at well data. A black dot means active, a black dot with a line through it means inactive, a a hollow dot with 4 smile line sprotruding from it means it splugged.

Your best bet is to hire a lawyer to review the mineral lease and see what the terms are. There should be clauses relating to how long a well can be shut-in before it is plugged.

I don’t know about KS but in TX operators are only required to plug a certain percentage of their inactive wells each year. They aren’t required to plug a well as soon as it’s inactive.
