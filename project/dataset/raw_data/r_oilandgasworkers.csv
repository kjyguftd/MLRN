"The US tech sector offers a wealth of opportunities for E-Techs! Here are some tips to kickstart your research:

Think about your interests! E-Techs are in demand across various industries. Do you find yourself drawn to aerospace, medical devices, or maybe renewable energy? Researching leading companies in those fields will give you a solid starting point.

Don't just focus on the tech giants! While big names often come to mind, there are many smaller and mid-sized firms offering competitive pay, benefits, and great work environments. Resources like [best tech companies to work for 2024](https://www.clickittech.com/talent/best-tech-companies-to-work-for/) can be helpful, but be sure to explore companies specific to your area of interest. They might offer the perfect combination of pay, benefits, and a positive work culture.

A large movement of the rig (another ship hit us) followed by an announcement for everyone to go to abandon station. The movement and PA announcement themselves not so bad, but the sound of absolute dread in the guys voice when he told everyone to go to stations made me think ""oh fuck its happening""

"I used to be a chemical plant operator for 12.5 years and yes there can be exposure.

I grew up on a small farm and there can be some exposure from this to, also worked on repairing farm equipment and there can be some exposure.

Some of the guys i used to work with 20 years ago at the plant have died from cancer but people around my community have also died from cancer as well people who worked in Ag and equipment repairs.


Then there have been multiple nuclear bombs test around the world and nuclear accidents around the world that have spread nuclear particles around the world.

My dad worked Agriculture jobs up until his 50's and we lived down the street from a old DDT plant.

He did have prostrate cancer and dementia when he died.
Both my inlaws both died from colon cancer.

It would be interesting how things of exposure were before the 1940's and  chemical plants and refineries.

I live in the Coastal Bend of Corpus Christi, there is plenty of oil/gas, refineries, chemical plants and uranium mining here plus Agriculture.

"The big 3 that gets almost everyone unless you have traumatic death are: atherosclerosis, cancer and cognitive disease (Alzheimer's Dementia etc).

What you are asking is what is the relative risk increase, but also what is the absolute risk. For example, if your risk of cancer doubles, that sounds scary. But if it goes from 1;2000 to 1:1000 - well you might be on with that. It also is going to matter what kind of cancer (we say cancer like it's one thing but it's not). Live long enough and every single male will hey prostate cancer. Does it matter? Not really, Harley anyone ever dies of it. Pancreatic cancer - kiss your ass goodbye.

What is really going to impact things is the Occupational Hygiene program where you work. Do they take wearing respirators seriously, or just check the box at the safety meeting? Are exposure levels monitored? Is the detection equipment taken care of? Do they bandaid fixes and have leaks or is the maintenance program budgeted well?

"There's a long-term ""fight"" between citizens and local administration in my area due to the pollution brought by the many refineries we have, but the cancer rate in the area isn't much bigher than the average rate in the whole country. For sure years back they used to release everything in the atmosphere, all remaining cargo during ship operations was drained into the sea and there was completely no control about the pullution, meaning that for sure a lot of people could get cancer, especially if they used to bath in the products while working.
Each country has its own regulations to control the pollution but more or less all of us are on the safe side of the job if we compare to the previous decades, even 20 years ago it was far worse than now.
You can consider that almost all oil movements are closed in the pipelines for both safety and economical reasons, therefore your exposure is limited to really small quantities of dangerous chemicals. As somebody said in the replies, it depends a lot on the plant you'll work in - for sure working in the laboratory for chemical analysis is far worse than working at the jetty.

"Some are scrapped, some are simply abandoned. 

A couple of weeks ago, I heard an offshore mechanic telling about a time he was accidentally dropped off at an abandoned rig. He was scheduled to go to another rig, but the helicopter pilots flew to the wrong place. Once he got off the helicopter (and they left), he realized there was no one else there. (The hard to believe part here is that most rigs have helicopter landing officers, and there is always someone there to meet the helicopter - but maybe not always with small operators/companies). Anyway - he‚Äôs out there alone with no way to call for help - too far out for a cell phone signal, no active WiFi since it‚Äôs abandoned, no radio on board because it‚Äôs abandoned.  I don‚Äôt remember how he got help, but a few creative ideas come to mind - signaling to passing fishing boats or ships, maybe.

Pay attention to how it's worded.  It says ""the variable pay of your **total compensation** ranges from 40-60% **in addition to** your base salary"".  That means that your bonus will be 40-60% of your total compensation, and your salary will make up the corresponding 40-60%.  It doesn't say that the variable pay is 40-60% of the salary.

I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre not in the industry due to the types of questions you‚Äôve asked in this thread. And that‚Äôs okay. We‚Äôre happy to share information. I think the biggest thing you don‚Äôt know is that a driller is not responsible for ‚Äúfinding‚Äù oil or gas. They are following directions. Somewhere up the chain, a reservoir engineer, a geologist and a completions engineer have gotten to gather and looked at all kinds of scans, old data, surveys, and logs and decided that there is a pocket of oil in a certain place at a certain depth. Then they decide where to drill, what direction, what depth and how far. And that information is given to a driller and he follows those directions. And even then there‚Äôs not necessarily oil flowing out of the ground. We don‚Äôt want that. So it‚Äôs not like in an old movie where they are drilling and oil is blowing out the top of some wooden drilling apparatus.",r/oilandgasworkers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhZnhUR0NfUjh2Zldsc185MEVlMDRreVZHRERHUlJLQkRoOWlySUNfT2dycmx1eWtqOXBja0ZEZy1uSW9lclYzR0FoUUx1eE40aWJNZGNhemp6SWdkM0E9PQ==

"Depends what you mean by ‚Äúfind oil‚Äù. 

In the context of exploration it‚Äôs pretty rare for a new well to discover commercial quantities of hydrocarbons and go on to be developed. Like 1:10 to 1:20 for true ‚Äúwildcat‚Äù exploration drilling with YOU working directly on the well for the operating company. It‚Äôs only happened to me once in my 30+ year career (Corrib gas field West of Ireland) and I‚Äôve been involved in a LOT of exploration well drilling. 
 
Outside of that many wildcat wells find oil (or gas or both) but turn out non commercial. Basically the producible volumes ended up too small to be profitable to produce, thus they were never developed. I‚Äôve been involved in a bunch of those. Exciting at the time but ultimately frustrating.

I‚Äôve drilled a lot of appraisal and development wells but there the oil has already been ‚Äúfound‚Äù, and we are delineating or producing the oil, which while exciting is not quite the same thing.

Some people get lucky though. The guys at Exxon working Guyana Stabroek block have racked up 30+ deepwater commercial discoveries  totalling over 10billion barrels recoverablr in the last 9 years, easily the most prolific deepwater wildcat play of the last decade or so.

How much more will be a good offer. I haven't lived outside my country before so can't really judge cost and standard of living.

"It‚Äôs fine to not know anything about a subject, but I would stop making declarative statements like you do. This is an ambiguous, meaningless statement.

It is not a binary replacement. If demand for oil decreases, so will the price. Cost to extract will not decrease. Not all oil costs the same to extract, so everything that does not have a high enough margin or is margin negative, stays in the ground.

That means more of those worthless wildcat wells.

The opposite happens (unlikely, saving some miracle carbon capture technology) and some of those worthless wells potentially become marginal or valuable.",r/oilandgasworkers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnLXpFU0VFZkkwQXV2WlhFcUlxZkhfZHFGc2dEY1N5TEJiSzdBeWhLYTVhcEhDOWhWcjNJS2gzbERNMk9yWVFLVHVUU2xxNXVjMFQzX3hxdmF6ald5c1E9PQ==
