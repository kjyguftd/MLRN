"I am constantly asking this question, as I develop aimodels.org. I alternate between catching up with whats new by browsing twitter, and what has 'stuck' for over 6 months. 

Keeping up isn't really possible (I think there are a few who manage better at it), because there is a good chance it will be obsoleted / superseded a month or two down the line. 

That said, here is what I skim to get a sense of what is happening:

1) Twitter (following a lot of people in the Open Source AI space) 

Updates seem to fit in these categories mostly:

- New 'foundation models'

- Technique / method improvements

- Fine tune releases (smaller teams making a name for themselves) Often through implementing the items from 'technique/method improvements'

- Adapting to more diverse hardware (memory tricks/ quantization)

2) Look over trending models at hugging face

3)  Check the Google News Tech / AI section

4) To a lesser extent, discord

Specifically for Open Source AI, I'm trying to fill that gap, part of the issue on that many of the discussions are happening in academia or closed sessions where startups and industry are invited. So many published efforts come from Huggingface & Higher Ed collaborations. There is a strong network around this that can publicize the efforts across different channels (linkedin / blogs) and it is a bit 'read only' if you're not inside that collective.

At least that's been my experience. Feels like I'm starting to make progress in getting something going, but it's been a lot of work. I've sort of started following the bigger picture discussions around copyright and government policy. Many government departments have been seeking feedback over the last months on AI, and those responses are public record - So I'm thinking that I will write blog articles maybe fishing out interesting bits of groups like the Software Freedom Conservancy. 

It will be kind of dry, I'm not sure it's the content that will have people beating a path to my site lol!",r/opensourceai,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTMW16WkNzWDJhSGNsVHk0aVlGOGxVcWNvNWJodjV3dEV3OG5fZnZremc5SlAtZEs1ekdseE1nSjAxdVhfT2hNUUt0S2VJX0VpaHM1cjlLelhTcXZRcWc9PQ==

"I personally say no. Keeping AI closed source only fuels speculation that it is manipulated and biased based upon a political agenda. Before someone starts preaching one side or the other, it doesn't matter. Any derivative political agenda is bad no matter what. Software should always be free of politics. 

I'm a firm believer that open source paves the way to ensure that software is indeed free and non-political in every way possible because it can be inspected and analyzed at any given point. I also firmly believe that open source offers the best opportunities for innovation.
