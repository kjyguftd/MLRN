"Hey, my field!

The multi-valuedness of the polarization has direct implications when trying to predict the properties of materials like ferroelectrics and piezoelectrics, i.e., materials which are valued for their electric polarization.

To make a long story short, if you do a single shot calculation of the polarization, what you find is that you can actually get different values for its magnitude depending on your definition of the unit cell. If polarization is an intrinsic property of the system, this should not be the case.

This was resolved via the modern theory of polarization, which basically says we must consider changes in polarization.

As such, when we compute the polarization of a ferroelectric material such as with DFT, we must actually compute the polarization of the structure of interest, as well as the polarization of a reference phase that is connected to it (and the polarization of each structure along the path connecting the two structures). By taking the difference, we can then ensure we have the ""correct"" value for the polarization. If you do not do this, you can dramatically overestimate the polarization of your material.

See figure 9 of A beginner's guide to the modern theory of polarization by Nicola Spaldin for an example (although the whole thing is worth reading)

Space “exists” in the same sense that the distance between Paris and London exists. Note that that distance isn’t very well defined right, I might have meant the distance along the surface of the earth, or I might be asking for a straight line that goes through the earth.

Space in a physics theory “exists” in the same sense: we have an agreed upon definition of what the distance between two points is, and if we use that definition, other physicists will understand what we mean.

For the definition used by these authors, that is basically correct- it is some system that has spontaneous and self-sustaining oscillations. The oscillations don't have to be in the physical structure, though- they could be any macroscopic observable, such as a density, or a magnetization, or a charge dipole.

Note that with this definition, there is not necessarily anything that exotic or quantum about it.

"Ok I got that this clump of small balls (still loosely connected to their nuclei) are synchronously moved up and down. I can accept that those small balls have an ""aura"" that we call ""electromagnetic field"". This sort of halo around them has an inertia so, when this bunch of balls moves up and down, it follows them lagging a bit behind, and so forming some wrinkles (""waves""). Now, since those balls are ultra-micro, I expect this halo to barely exit the diameter of the antenna, but I can be generous and imagine that this antenna has a resulting halo like half a meter around it. But then that's it, though. Instead it seems that this ""wrinkable halo"" is not a sphere around those electrons, but a jelly omnipresent in the universe, so the wrinkles propagate through this jelly until reaching the Voyager.

"If I understand you correctly, you essentially want a dynamo on the wheels of the rollerblades to generate electricity. 

Any dynamo will add resistance so the base situation is the humanoid robot without the energy generation. That is your minimum energy expenditure. 

Then you add a dynamo which adds resistance and increases the power needed to keep the movement at a constant speed. The dynamo will be able to recuperate a (large) part of that extra energy spent, but you're not getting the base energy back. 

The only tiny advantage that you could have is through regenerative braking. When you come to a standstill, you usually just lose the kinetic energy to friction. A part of that could be recovered through the dynamo. 

However, it seems unlikely the added weight and friction of the dynamo would cost more energy than you can get out of the system.

"The atmospheric pressure does influence the partial pressure of vapour, the sum of all partial pressures is the total pressure. The atmosphere is considered as one homogenous gas/vapour, it's all just a model to understand how the mixture that is the atmosphere behaves by splitting it in its components and studying the behaviour of the singular component.

When the vapour condenses it separates from the atmosphere and becomes a single component body/system which is subject to the total pressure of the system.

In thermodinamics you consider fluid as continuos, not formed by discrete particles, but again this is all a model. In reality all particles are subjected to total pressure, but studying such problems particle by particle is impractical, lets say.

If you want to model gas/vapour behaviour for inhomogenous fluid, you can, but you need complex differential equations

"For how i understand it you have to think about this also on the particle level for this.

The difference between a liquid and a gas is the kind of bonds the molecules can form with eachother. Bonds are broken by reciving energy, thats why if you heat up a liquid it can evaporate and does so gradually. Thogh it's not like each particle detaches from the liquid and then is forever gas, at the interface there is a continous back and forth of particles latching and detatching, but if the total energy of the system is fixed the total number of particled as vapour and as liquid will be rougly constant; since the number of particles is enormous it's very unlikely that fluctuations would be perceptible.

What happens is that the gas starts interacting with the liquid and starts to knock out bonds, but at a certain point there will be particles of the fluid (in vapour form) that start interacting with the liquid and reforming some bonds. The situation moves until equilibrium is reached and you have the same number of molecules forming bonds and breaking bonds.

Pressure in general acts like a force pushing all the particles closer together, making creating bonds easier, that's why evaporation point changes with temperature, but also decreases the amount of vapour in the air, because it pushes the back and forth at interface towards creating more bonds.

In all of this partial pressure is just a concise way of expressing concentration and pressure in a single term, since those are the factors (at a certain temperature) that influence the equilibrium point

edit: pressure ov vapour is the pressure for which there is equilibrium at a certain temperature

"OK thank you..

To summarize: increasing vapor content in the air increases pressure (which is obvious). Equilibrium of vapor content is reached at 20 mbar (in our example). However the vapor also has approx. 1 bar pressure. The ideal Gas model ""Just"" describes that the amount of vapor in the Air can be estimated from dalton's law and no partial pressure shifts due to influences of other gases have to be considered?!

To Go one step Further.

If there is a water/salt mixture in an evacuated enclosure with 10 % air in it, the mixture will boil at 100 °C (assumption to allow for an easier discussion of pressure in the system), then the final pressure will be 1 bar (VLE for water) + 10% for the remaining air content. So the Mass fraction of the remaining water resembles the VLE of the mixture at one bar, but the pressure measurement is wrong. Am i right in this assumption?

Moreover there is No boiling when water evaporates below its vapor pressure as density changes occur at the surface only. When the pressure of the liquid is the same as in the gas above the liquid IT starts to boil as density changes in all of the liquid?",r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZM0oyY19IV19rRnBlQ2h5VEY3bGU0cEJxUFVYc0hmS1lJVjVkM3huTFF6ZWlRZUM5UE16YmtFSGxwdGhvQW5EbzBlaWloT1JQeVVEWGluODdVamtkNEE9PQ==

"I think what makes this hard to visualize is that we can't sense the electric field in daily life. Yes, the electric field is omnipresent and represents the sum of all the electrically charged particles in the universe. 


In terms of the power and how those waves propagate so far, there are a few points to consider: 


1. There's no energy loss due to the medium. If a travelling wave goes down a rope, the energy dissipates the further it goes due to losses in the material. However, the electric field doesn't ""resist"" change in any way, so there's nothing to stop a wave getting from one end of the universe to the other. 


2. EM waves are a ""far field"" effect, where the wave is far enough from other sources of reflection, absorption, and interference that it can be described in a simple way. The ""near field"" effects are much more complex as the changes in the electric field interact with even the radio electronic components, local pieces of metal, etc. It's like how the sound at a concert can be a mess due to all the echoes, but if you're hearing it from across town, the sound is a simple waveform travelling through the air 


3. Because the changes in the electric field propagate in all spatial directions, you can imagine a spherical surface increasing in radius outward at the speed of light (the boundary of how far those changes to the field have travelled). Energy was put in initially to accelerate the particles at the source, and the field propagates electrical energy from that to go potentially affect other particles. The total initial energy is contained within the surface of a sphere. If you're far away, you can only interact with a small portion of that sphere, so you can only receive a fraction of the initial energy. This is the inverse square law, where the available power decreases in proportion to the square of the distance from the source. 



All in all, the answer is that you need a very large amount of power to create a signal that can be received from far away (eg, a broadcasting station), and the signal received is amplified by the electronics of the receiver",r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRC1VR21yOGE3aUd4SE1HVkhKWElWSDNYT1lZblVWaFc1X0pjWEY3Z1VYaW5wU25ramhXREpLVDE0bGlEUnQ5MnVlTWJ5MkY0QWI5b3pydTJGdm1BTXc9PQ==

Quantum wells are thin layer of materials can be manufactured across a 100 mm, or even larger diameter wafers. 

 But if you are thinking about where can quantum mechanics be important for large man made objects you might consider the LIGO interferometer. One of the reasons it is so sensitive is that a technique know as quantum squeezing is used to reduce the noise. That system is very large kilometers in scale. 

If that is considered cheating, one can look around and find examples where mechanical resonators are cooled down to very low temperatures and they are limited by quantum noise and you have small but bulk objects that behave quantum mechanically.

 In the area of sensors, I think there is a lot of interest in improving magnetometers and gravity measuring instruments using quantum mechanics as well.

if it's acting as a first principle for the macroscopic phenomenons (if we exclude relativity) it really means classical mechanics is just about approximations but does not constitute anymore mathematical realities (their formulas) or realities at all.

Yes especially if it replaced classical mechanics as first principles, since physics is all about trying to understand some first principles (with quantum I'm not even sure we can have some stable first principles)

"In most everyday situations, if you're dealing with macroscopic objects, you can get away with classical physics. For example, for modelling the air in your room, at 300K the classical and quantum ideal gas model are virtually indistinguishable, so you could say that you don't need QM. However, there are some interesting exceptions to this:

1. The two classical examples that lead to the development of QM: blackbody radiation (it results in the UV catastrophe if treated classically) and the photoelectric effect, for which Einstein won his nobel prize.
2. All macroscopic forms of magnetism can only be explained with QM. There is a [theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr%E2%80%93Van_Leeuwen_theorem) that proves that matter at finite temperature cannot be magnetized at a macroscopic scale in a purely classical model.
3. Charge carriers in metals behave like an ideal quantum fermi gas (rather than a classical ideal gas). This means that there are macroscopic properties of metals, like heat and electrical conductance, that are measurably different from what a classical model would predict. You can read more about this [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_electron_model).
4. Related, the theory of [electronic band structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_band_structure), which is our current understanding for why some materials are conductors, insulators, semi-conductors etc. is based on QM.
5. Superconductivity and superfluidity can both only be explained using QM. Although you probably don't encounter them in ""normal"" conditions (at least yet), they are still quantum phenomena manifesting on a macroscopic scale.
6. Of course our modern understanding of nuclear physics is quantum, which is important for some macroscopic phenomena like nuclear reactors and weapons, and how stars burn.

I'm sure there are more but those are the ones I can think of off the top of my head.

A rule of thumb is that it's fine to treat things classically if the thermal energy, kT (where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is temperature in Kelvin) is much larger than some natural unit of energy in the system. For example, for blackbody radiation, the classical model breaks down for very energetic EM waves, which is in the UV range. Similarly, for charge carriers in metals, the ideal fermi gas has a natural energy scale called the fermi energy. For metals, one can estimate the fermi energy and it turns out to be much higher than the thermal energy at room temperature (in fact it is higher than the melting point of most metals), which is why one must use QM to describe them.",r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZeHBjQUdIYVZCS2N4SnNvR0UtUkZsUXI3dGtXbTdnb1luSGpiOFdiTVVocVFrTWxlS0VHb0pGd2F1NGJXTmF4eXRjallKX1Rid3c1NnBscE4tMm9ZRnE0TXJOYmlHMWdMNW03aldYd2dsWlU9

Yes they do.

An electron, fired from an electron gun falls with exactly the same acceleration (downward) as a dropped teacup or a fired bullet.

Your illustration with the elephant simply shows the effect of air resistance - when their weight matches their drag. Gravity *absolutely* makes all masses accelerate in the same way  - but depending on their cross-section, there may be opposing forces (drag).

Kaku's comment there is by the by - not relevant.

It's true that GR models (very well) large masses, and QM rules in the nanoscopic regime. But BHoles are firmly macroscopic (those that we know of) and behave like other large masses in that sense.

They just happen to have escape velocities >c.

The books in the series are:

* Space, time and motion: Roughly, classical mechanics including special and general relativity
* Quanta and fields: Quantum mechanics with emphasis on quantum field theory
* Complexity and emergence (upcoming): complexity and emergent phenomena such as thermodynamics and entropy

"So applications of Chern-Simmons theory and AdS/CFT correspondance in condensed matter mean nothing?

From ""The Evolution of the Physicist's Picture of Nature"" by Paul Dirac

>Schrodinger worked from
a more mathematical point of view, trying to find a beautiful theory for describing atomic events, andw as helped by De Broglie's ideas of waves associated with particles. He was able to extend De Broglie's ideas and to get a very beautiful
equation, known as Schrodinger's wave equation, for describing atomic processes. Schrodinger got this equation by pure thought, looking for some beautiful generalization of De Broglie's ideas, and not by keeping close to the experimental
development of the subject in the way Heisenberg did.

>I might tell you the story I heard from
Schrodinger of how, when he first got
the idea for this equation, he immediate
ly applied it to the behavior of the elec
tron in the hydrogen atom, and then he
got results that did not agree with ex
periment. The disagreement arose be
cause at that t ime it was not known that
the electron has a spin. That, of course,
was a great disappointment to Schro
dinger, and it caused him to abandon the
work for some months. Then he noticed
that if he applied the theory in a more
approximate way, not taking into ac
count the refinements required by rela
tivity, to this rough approximation his
work was in agreement with observa
tion. He published his first paper with
only this rough approximation, and in
that way Schrodinger's wave equation
was presented to the world. Afterward,
of course, when people found out how to
take into account correctly the spin of
the electron, the discrepancy between
the results of applying Schrodinger's rel
ativistic eel uation and the experiments
was completelv cleared up.

>I think there is a moral to this story, namely that it is more important to have beauty in one's equations than to
have them fit experiment. If Schrodinger had been more confident of his work, he could have published it some months earlier, and he could have published a more accurate equation. That equation is
now known as the Klein-Gordon equation, although it was really discovered by Schrodinger, and in fact was discovered by Schrodinger before he discovered hi snonrelativistic treatment of the hydrogen atom. It seems that if one is working from the point of view of getting beauty in one's equations, and if one has really a sound insight, one is on a sure line of
progress. If there is not complete agreement between the results of one's work and experiment, one should not allow oneself to be too discouraged, because the discrepancy may well be due to minor features that are not properly
taken into account and that will get
cleared up with further developments of the theory.

">these things can and are thought of without the knowledge of science fiction, but okay, my question has been shut down the second time now with the argument of fiction which I find just a bad argument as someone who is not a physicist

I can think of purple elephants, but that doesn't make them real.

Consider that I had no knowledge of your prior question. You've been given the same answer twice, apparently, but instead of seeing that as significant, you seem to be reacting defensively. You don't need to be familiar with any particular piece of fiction in order to have been influenced by it. People talk, and share ideas, and post them into fan wikis.

>it is invalidation without an actual counter argument

It literally can't be a counter argument, as there was no initial argument. You asked a question; you didn't make a claim.

>What are these common terms and phrases? I have no issue with hypothesis and speculation, I much prefer it to invalidation.

I used some of them, like ""extra dimension"". That's the idea that there are compactified dimensions of space that we don't interact with; the idea is frequently used to help explain the comparative weakness of gravity, although string theory also requires 6 extra dimensions of space to work.

We have, in fact, attempted to measure these conjectured extra dimensions, and found nothing. It may be possible our measurements are not sensitive enough, but there comes a point when it's more reasonable to conclude that we've been looking for something that just isn't there (and it's up for debate what that point is).

You could also look up the ""many worlds interpretation"" of the Schrödinger equation. This concept is used to explain wavefunction collapse and the so-called measurement problem. I seem to recall some very tentative ideas that if many worlds is correct, it could be experimentally verified, but I can't seem to find anything readily.

To be abundantly clear, none of these ideas are concerned with ""parallel realms"". They don't discount such possibility, but ultimately these are not scientifically productive questions. Science depends on things like falsifiability, that's why it's not compatible with statements like, ""Multiverse is a very inaccurate term imo since there are different ways multiple realms can exist."" Sure, anything is possible if you handwave the question how and the issue of proof. That's just not how science works. Although if you want to explore a theoretical taxonomy of multiverses, you could look up Max Tegmark's 4-level multiverse ensemble.

One of the reasons you won't find much consistent terminology is because scientists define terms explicitly for their purposes. What ""multiverse"" means in one paper will differ in the next paper. Common, shared definitions tend not to emerge until a single definition proves useful. And since this is all untestable, none of it is particularly useful.

>I cannot believe that noone is working these things out, so I'll look elsewhere. so I thank you for you indepth answer, I had hoped information had been more readily available with less ideological restrictions.

"I understand that you're excited about the new concepts in physics you're hearing about.  But given that you don't yet know what you don't know, assuming that your thought is original or that it's meaningful is mighty bold (or stupid, but I'm giving you the benefit of doubt by merely calling you bold).

You may absolutely have a wonderful idea, but to test it, start by understanding how science works.

1.  A new idea in science is called a hypothesis.  A hypothesis must make testable predictions.  If your hypothesis involves alternate universes, there's no way to test it - so it'll go to the Crack Pot Ideas Bin^(TM).

2.  The test must be independently repeatable and verifiable.  No point having scenarios that will occur only once, or randomly, or never. 

3.  The burden of proof lies on the claimant.  If you propose a hypothesis, you should come up with the theoretical or experimental evidence for it.  Theoretical evidence is a mathematical proof that is consistent and built on existing theories, or can morph to existing theories under appropriate parameters (for example, Einstein's relativity theory predicts how matter and energy behaves at near light speeds, but it turns into Newton's laws of motion at real world speeds - which we already know to work)

Start with Newtonian physics and basic math.  Promote yourself to special and general relativity (since you're interested in the very big).  Learn classical quantum mechanics, QED and QCD to understand the very small.  All these theories already work under specific conditions, and only break down at specific points.

"I'll repost my comment addressing the whole ""it's not physics"" argument which you were making


From ""The Evolution of the Physicist's Picture of Nature"" by Paul Dirac

>Schrodinger worked from
a more mathematical point of view, trying to find a beautiful theory for describing atomic events, andw as helped by De Broglie's ideas of waves associated with particles. He was able to extend De Broglie's ideas and to get a very beautiful
equation, known as Schrodinger's wave equation, for describing atomic processes. Schrodinger got this equation by pure thought, looking for some beautiful generalization of De Broglie's ideas, and not by keeping close to the experimental
development of the subject in the way Heisenberg did.

>I might tell you the story I heard from
Schrodinger of how, when he first got
the idea for this equation, he immediate
ly applied it to the behavior of the elec
tron in the hydrogen atom, and then he
got results that did not agree with ex
periment. The disagreement arose be
cause at that t ime it was not known that
the electron has a spin. That, of course,
was a great disappointment to Schro
dinger, and it caused him to abandon the
work for some months. Then he noticed
that if he applied the theory in a more
approximate way, not taking into ac
count the refinements required by rela
tivity, to this rough approximation his
work was in agreement with observa
tion. He published his first paper with
only this rough approximation, and in
that way Schrodinger's wave equation
was presented to the world. Afterward,
of course, when people found out how to
take into account correctly the spin of
the electron, the discrepancy between
the results of applying Schrodinger's rel
ativistic eel uation and the experiments
was completelv cleared up.

>I think there is a moral to this story, namely that it is more important to have beauty in one's equations than to
have them fit experiment. If Schrodinger had been more confident of his work, he could have published it some months earlier, and he could have published a more accurate equation. That equation is
now known as the Klein-Gordon equation, although it was really discovered by Schrodinger, and in fact was discovered by Schrodinger before he discovered hi snonrelativistic treatment of the hydrogen atom. It seems that if one is working from the point of view of getting beauty in one's equations, and if one has really a sound insight, one is on a sure line of
progress. If there is not complete agreement between the results of one's work and experiment, one should not allow oneself to be too discouraged, because the discrepancy may well be due to minor features that are not properly
taken into account and that will get
cleared up with further developments of the theory.

>That is how quantum mechanics was
discovered.

Trouble is... there are a lot of videos on the subject, and even within those three channels, they tend to break it apart into smaller sections, or combine even smaller parts into related topics like black holes and the possibility of other universes, so if you have the time and the interest, it'll be a rabbit hole worth going down.

"The Casimir force is one that always gets to me. Intuitively the concept is straightforward: you have two conductive plates that are parallel to each other (let’s assume they are in a large vacuum like an empty universe), they will attract. This is because vacuum fluctuations will be subject to boundary conditions imposed by the plates, and the number of EM modes that can exist outside the plates is greater than the number that can exist between the plates. This difference in energy density leads to an overall force that pushes the plates together.

The thing that I consider mind-bending is that calculating the force between the plates involves computing the sum of n from n=1 to infinity. There are multiple ways to analytically continue the solution of this divergent series, where instead of getting infinity you get -1/12. Mathematicians will tell you that this is an erroneous answer, and one of the pitfalls of analytic continuation. But the curious thing is that the -1/12 works out for the solution of the Casimir force (even if you sidestep the analytic continuation, and the result agrees with experiment).

"All of science builds off previous works and accomplishments.  This is essentially how we move forward, it’s a group effort.  Einstein was a genius at theoretical physics.  He interpreted the works of others is such a way that he created a new understanding of the universe and spacetime that holds up to this very day.  He saw our reality as if he was looking at the source code, and deserves all the recognition we give him.",r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZT3hhb1NSYTdEWnVvTDNlTTNWdTFKODZvaEpRT2pDTENVWGRmLUVOQjhxRFJoT0JTdmswTVBlSnJwbEoxbWMxbG5LSjFyX3pMMXVPM0pONVFxWG1JVkZuYjVmQmZCbTl0TTY5bTA3SlVxNzg9
"I’m a mathematical physicist but I minored in philosophy in my undergrad, so I might be able to explain it in a way that makes sense to you. 
Einstein first came out with his special relativity. It is a combination of Newtonian/Gallilean relativity and Maxwell’s equations. Special relativity is derived from mainly two postulates. A postulate is like a premise, but it it always true. The two premises are, 

1: The laws of physics are the same for all inertial/non-accelerating observers. 

2: it is a law of physics that light always propagates at the speed c. 

From these two postulates, we can logically infer that the faster you travel, with respect to some set of coordinates, the slower your time appears to pass from that coordinate. Since the speed of light must be constant in all reference frames, something has to give. Since speed has the dimensions [M T^(1)], then these two must change for the observer in order for the speed of light to remain the same. 

Let’s imagine our favourite experimental physicists, Alice and Bob. Alice is sitting on a bench at a train station. Suddenly, a train passes with an incredible speed, c/2, or half of the speed of light. Bob is sitting inside the train and is looking out the window. Alice sees herself as stationary, and Bob sees himself as stationary. Now we imagine that it’s dark and there’s a light in the front of the train. Since light has to travel with the same speed for everyone, both Bob and Alice sees the light travel at c. But this appears contradictory, since Bob should see it travel at c, since the light is emitted from the trains reference. But since the train is moving at 0.5c, we would think Alice observes the light travel at 1.5c. But this is where we remember the second postulate. Both have to observe the light traveling at c, so that implies that time must slow down for Bob from Alice’s perspective, and vice versa. This also applies to lengths, both time and distance seems to contract due to relative motion. 

But this formulation of relativity was derived ignoring the effects of gravity. Einstein eventually realized that gravity is locally equivalent to acceleration, and from this he formulated the general theory. It took Einstein roughly 10 years to properly incorporate gravity into his theory of relativity, and along the way, he discovered the importance of the geometric formulation and the merging of space and time into a 4 dimensional spacetime, of his special relativity done by Minkowski, and that lead to the General theory of relativity, where gravity is the curvature of spacetime itself. It is extremely hard to properly explain the significance of this curvature in spacetime without delving into some more abstract mathematical concepts. The best way to get an intuitive understanding of how a curved spacetime results in massive bodies apparently attracting each other, is to again imagine our experimental physicists, Alice and Bob. 

Alice and Bob are standing on the equator with their back turned against each other, looking in the direction parallel to the equator. Now, they both walk 10km straight ahead, parallel to the equator, and then both turn exactly 90° north and then keep walking in that trajectory. Eventually, Alice and Bob will bump into each other when they reach the North Pole. To them, it might seem as if some force has pushed them together. They were walking in parallel lines north, but they still somehow bumped into each other. The key insight here is that the surface of the earth is positively curved. Any two lines that are locally parallel will eventually cross. You can try it out self. Try drawing two parallel straight lines on a globe. They will eventually cross. This is the same concept of spacetime. If two people are moving in parallel lines in a curved spacetime, they will eventually bump into each other. Even if you aren’t moving in soace, you are always moving in time. An apple floating above the surface of the earth is moving parallel to the earth through time, even if the apple is stationary relative to the earth. But the “time” will curve towards the earth and therefore bring the apple with it physically. 

As said, this is hard to explain without the proper terminology and mathematics. I’m also very tired today, so I might not be the best at explaining right now. But if you want clarification on anything, let me know and I’ll try to improve my explanation.",r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZaTdGRDV2RFYzZjFHRURzQTJOS3ktekppOTVleXZOVTJQc2VKUnQ1ZlpRNjJfcDBBejFVZEFmYUdNNUhRZzlWZU5jdzZab3ozWVp1UXE0cG4zVjJreWc9PQ==

"You studied special relativity, you know about the Twin Paradox. It doesn’t impress you anymore. But what about the Twin Paradox on a torus?

A torus (also known by its tastier name doughnut) is a 2D square whose sides are wrapped around. First you roll the square into a cylinder, then you bend the cylinder so the two openings meet. On a torus, if you travel in a straight line, you always go back to where you started, because of the wraparound.

Now, there are two twins. One stays on Earth, the other leaves in a rocket. The traveling twin travels in a straight line without ever accelerating, yet still manages to return to Earth because the universe is a torus. Each twin believes the other underwent time dilation and is older. Neither underwent acceleration, so nothing breaks the symmetry between them. Who is older?

>! Actually the symmetry is broken . . . by the universe itself! The definition of a torus breaks the symmetries between space and time of special relativity, because we wrap around only space, not time. Any local, small-scale experiment will observe special relativity to work without any problem, but any global, large-experiment that can realize the universe is toroidal will run into weird issues like inability to synchronize clocks separated by large distances. Ultimately, the Earthbound twin will be older. !<",r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZVzc4a3ljVmRVSHdudGhqQ1o0VG92em1aTjBXdzRscERfSG9TcmpNRnpad2Qxb0ZNeUhPRTJBRkVMUTlBYWZrNGJUdmozQTltTW45RG5uMUtlU0FTWVE9PQ==

"When i was doing my Ma i had an acoustics professor who was the person who first described how the resonant frequency of a glass shifts once you start going towards the maximum stress. The deformation due to the mechanical stress of the sound itself makes it so that the resonant frequency goes higher (ie you can’t break a glass with sound by keeping the frequency constant). The change in density and shape is the cause, so personally i’d suspect that you could engineer “extreme” conditions (probably easier in an enclosed system) where you would have some non linear effect due to density/temperature changes that are due to the amount of energy carried by the mechanical/sound wave itself.",r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZ3ppQWctQ1dWckNpSlg5Y3V1VnBfaTdoZndIa01HTzA3YnFBcHB5VVVRVEpHN0Rqbk1qS1ZtMExLcFBCNDl5Vkhrc2FBQVRRMll1WF8zWEdUZmxxYXc9PQ==

"Ah good question! So we’re currently in what’s known as the NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era. What this means is yes, we have quantum computers, but at this point and time they don’t work very well. 

This is because the qubits we have are too “noisy” and prone to errors. We have proven the concepts/theory/efficacy of quantum computing with single qubits and multi-qubit devices, but as we scale the count of qubits up in a system, our results are so prone to errors that we can’t reliably implement all of the quantum algorithms that make quantum computing so special. The NISQ era is characterized by having systems with 50-100 qubits (which most advanced QC research facilities have), but we need something in the order of 500+ reliable qubits to really start seeing something special. 

This is currently a major problem in engineering, experimental physics, and materials. There really isn’t a lot of theory work going on now because it’s pretty much all been laid out for us in the past two or three decades, and now we’re just dealing with the actual application of scaling up these machines. You may hear in the news stuff like Google or IBM or some other startup making breakthroughs in QC with their 1000+ qubits machines, but the fact remains is that no one can reliably compute with actually using over 100 qubits right now.

Thanks for these clarifications, it's much clearer now !

It seems like the road is in some way paved now, if we have the necessary theoretical material and are able to do it with 100 stable qbits then 500 seems doable.

In fact Idk how big is the gap between the theory and the manufacturing part (there is always a challenge when it comes to putting the theory into practice, the industry and the machines manipulating these circuits and these particles must add a whole layer of technical challenge).

Do you know some good sources that focus on quantum computing and its practical dimension (theory put into practice) ? I know some good sources about quantum mechanics on general, and even some about the theoretical dimension of quantum computers, but not that much about the actual engineering, and practical applications of quantum computers. because I feel like there is always this gap between knowing the theory of how it works and how actually this theory is put into practice (for example I find it hard to imagine how we can actually get data and manipulate small particles even though I might know the theory, the way these small particles are manipulated and used must be a whole science in itself and idk if theoreticians have a role in it). I know there are some sources and material about it but idk which one would be more fitting to start with.

"I was a theoretical physicist for 10 years, researching nonequilibrium statistical mechanics.

Since the *6s* level is higher in silver, the energy required to excite an electron corresponds to the UV region instead of the visible region; consequently silver appears devoid of colors from the visible region of the spectrum.",r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaejNHcy1UUm9ORHlUVUZsOTZHaHduS0MyaUZzX2R6a3VIdzRXM1h1Qmx5WHdaR0tMY25WZlhDejNRbkw1R3hYem1RT3BrcHZoX1c3bUNNLU40c09yUEE9PQ==

Then there's also the slight caveat that the theory value is not set in stone: it comes from three contributions, namely the electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions. The first two can be computed exactly through the electroweak force, but the strong interaction term has no exact solution, and there has been some investigation into whether the commonly accepted number is correct or not.

"I don't entirely understand some of the questions you're asking. I teach science in secondary school, and don't normally use programming languages to teach concepts.

However, I think I have a sense of what this question might be:

>I heard the produce different waves by forming patterns, is it correct? Do they know the pattern they are in?

I suspect the 'patterns' you've heard about reference the topology and other aspects of the extra dimensions I mentioned. In string theory, these extra dimensions determine everything about fundamental particles, including properties like charge. However, there's a truly mind-boggling number of possible configurations: 10^(500) is an often-cited number of possibilities, but it could be a tens of thousands of orders of magnitude greater than that.

While AI might be useful in helping us explore this configuration space one-by-one, many physicists have begun to move away from string theory as 'the right answer' for other reasons. Now it's more widely seen as a rich set of mathematical tools, but by no means is there a consensus that it's wrong. (It'd be more accurate to say that it's not even developed enough to test whether it's wrong.) My own sense is that, in the best case, there's a significant missing piece to the theory, but I'm by no means an expert.

>what pattern do they have to form to fire a gravity wave?

In quantum mechanics, particles don't ""fire"" waves. They *are* waves. A gravitational wave would simply be a whole lot of gravitons moving in some coherent wave, analogous to the way that a light waves are made of a bunch of photons. Part of the wave-like behavior is intrinsic to all particles, because we describe them using mathematical oscillators, but in the case of bosons they also have symmetric wavefunctions, which means they can sort of ""overlap"" in space; a large enough number of photons or gravitons sort of smear into each other and produce something that looks and acts like a classical wave.",r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRjlaWVoyN3JKd0QtZHlmWHZxNm9BdnFJbldJYUs4dWZ1UWF6bWRYYncweWVZZHJ6VHZGTG01QkZod0hfMG9qaHo5SmVvNW8xQnlTeVZmUEJDb2lTUVE9PQ==

">Is it possible to observe them?

I'm not sure if you mean gravitons or extra dimensions, but in both cases, there are experiments trying to do so. In the case of extra dimensions, our tests have tended to produce negative results. This is one of the more recent findings I'm aware of:

[https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2018/07/048/meta](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2018/07/048/meta)

In the case of gravitons, direct detection may be impossible because gravity is so weak, but there are some indirect lines of evidence, including:

">In that case, a computer that is running a program without being interrupted or shut down has free will.

A computer doesn't have desires. But let's ignore that part. Say a robot is not programed to hurt anyone, but someone forces it to hurt someone, say someone pushes it into a human. You wouldn't want to destroy that robot. But if a robot is programed to hurt someone, and it does, then you would want to destroy that robot. 

So yeh, in this case you would use a similar concept to my compatibilist free will to determine if robot is a threat to society and hence decide what to do.

>You are not a threat to society if you don't do this on your own.

The main practical way to determine if someone is a threat to society is to use my or similar defintions of compatibilist free will.

"Stat Mech is a diverse, deeply ramified field that reaches into many areas of physics, e.g. hard & soft condensed matter physics, biophysics, econonophysics, etc. For me, it is by far most interesting area in theoretical physics, in terms of the diversity of ideas and concepts, and it is also deeply connected with experimental/computational physics. The latter is exceptionally important because you are never theorizing in a vacuum: bad ideas gets weeded out quickly, and the synergy between experiment and theory propels development in the field much faster than say, high energy physics or cosmology. Here are some of the most active areas in Stat Mech from my perspective/interest:

(1) Non-equilibrium stat mech, especially of active matter. Basically, how can we understand the collective behavior of large number particles in the presence of continuous energy flow from large to small scales.

(2) Glasses and disordered system. How can we understand excitations and phase transitions in system with quenched disorder, i.e. lacking obvious symmetries such as translational and/or translational symmetry found in traditional systems (liquids, solids, etc.).

(3) How can we understand the behavior of small systems (from 1-10\\^4 particles) in thermal contact with a large heat bath, in particular, how can we understand and describe extremal fluctuations of small systems and their impacts, e.g. small macromolecular assemblies in cells.

(4) The role of exotic symmetries, e.g. conformal invariance, in equilibrium/non-equibrium/disorder-driven  phase transitions.

(5) The formation and encoding of long-term collective memories in many-body systems with simple interactions.

Here I've ignored most areas of quantum statistical mechanics (b/c I'm not knowledgeable there) that are areas of active research, e.g. topological phases, correlated electrons, dynamical density functional theory, etc.

The other great thing about Stat Mech is that it's extremely deep, but the barrier to entry for doing productive research is surprisingly low. Mathematically, Stat Mech can get super gnarly, with things like p-adic analysis, AdS/CFT, conformal field theory. But in many cases, you can ask very deep questions with quite simple (to write down but not to solve) toy models. The asymptotic/mean-field/infinite-dimensional properties of these models can in sometimes be figured out/guessed at from simple physical arguments; in other cases, exact solutions are very hard/impossible to come by, but numerical simulation on a computer can be done quite easily, e.g. by a smart undergraduate programming in Python, that will yield  deep insights.",r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaaEo4RDBhekc4UHF6Sm1mTEs5ajYxN2x1T2FUTWJkZTJkSGp4c1dpczhVOHptMVh3S2hNa0MzT2djSS1mWkJUNW1WSWlEMDdQNjJVaGpERUdNVW1ka1E9PQ==

But you don't need to use compatibilism to judge someone, only consequentialism : will this person continue to be a threat to society or not ? If he has been forced, then threatening society isn't part of his core programming (to continue the computer analogy) and thus will not be a problem in the future.

Let me give you a definition. Making an action in line with your desires free from external coercion from an agent.

OK, lets play a game, you determine if I'm a threat to society or not.

"I’ve done it before. I used to shoot handguns competitively, a couple of formats called IDPA, USPSA and IPSC.

I also dabbled in photography and would use my friends or fellow competitors as my subjects 

My newest DSLR, a canon 7D is capable of 1/8000 at its fastest shutter speed.

If my math is right, this is 125 micro seconds.

If the rest of my math is right, a .233 at muzzle velocity (assuming ~3700 feet per second) would have covered 4.875 inches in the time the shutter is open at 1/8000 or 125 microseconds.

A 9mm at muzzle velocity (assuming 1200 feet per second) using the same math would cover 1.8 inches.

My experience capturing shots like the shot in OP, similar to this shot of mine at an IDPA competition is, its not so much the capabilities of the camera (you can still get shots like that occasionally with an iPhone...) its the lighting that makes them possible. You have to have a reflection of light off the bullet, or in the case of the photo in the OP, the bullet has to be between the camera and a light source (the sky)

"I'm only learning the basics of physics at the moment (although I do have a maths degree), so I too know that there are many people much more knowledgeable than me in this subreddit. However, I do know that one thing that's really common in rough physics calculations is to make assumptions that simplify the problem, which we know may be a bit wrong, but in a way that gives us an answer that is probably at least the same magnitude as the real answer.  We don't expect the answer to be specifically accurate, but to at least give us a ballpark range, so we know whether or not a situation is feasible.

"TL:DR: Your 1/20th exposure calculation is only 4.3 stops less light. Modern pro cameras have a dynamic range of 11-12 stops. Shiny metal object in direct sun, 4.3 stops under-exposed will still be brighter than a grey object in the photo. 

This is a shiny metal object, with a very recently barrel polished copper jacket. If the sun is behind the photographer, or we have a decent angle of incidence and reflection and the bullet was stationary, the specular highlight on the shiny surface of the projectile would be an over-exposed highlight, maybe 1-stop over exposed, like any other shiny metal object might be. Your 1/20th calculation is about right, but that's only a little over 4-stops underexposure for the moving projectile vs stationary. 

If the projectile returns a specular highlight 1-stop over exposed, we'll have your 1/20th calculation (4.3-stops) giving us approximately 3.3-stops 'underexposed', below the highlight/white value. For a pro camera like a Canon R3, it has an11-12 stop dynamic range, that's actually just above the mid tone. Good exposure. The photographer's selected shutter speed was fast enough to keep the motion blur 'short' enough to return plenty of light for capture.

What you're saying is perfectly correct if the bullet was very dark, or the photographer had used a slow shutter speed and the projectile had motion blurred along most/all of the frame. The luck was in the timing of the shutter release.

"So, it's been a dozen years since I have been in the firearm scene. I got to the point I was getting solidly into master in USPSA and pushed training too hard, so I just dropped it all. I can't do anything part way like that, all or nothing.

Never really reloaded centerfire rifle either, only pistol. 9mm and .40 S&W. I didn't play with loads either, I picked a known load to make the power factor I was aiming for, and went with it. Chuncked out 10's of thousands of rounds, not for accuracy, for price. It was handguns at an average target distance of \\~10 yards.

I just went on a cursory google search for some .223 load data, and pulled a faster round from the search results.

Didn't really give a shit about its performance from an individual rifle, because you know what? This isn't a discussion about ballistics. Its a discussion about photography and lighting, just misplaced on a physics forum.

It wouldn't have mattered if that bullet was actually going 3700 feet per second, or 700 feet per second. If the lighting, camera settings and timing all lined up perfectly? The results would have been exactly the same.

At one point in time, I had a couple dozen photos showing a bullet streak like that on my hard drive. When you are shooting two local club level USPSA Matches a weekend, starting in the early morning florida sun through early afternoon, so getting all the lighting you need, and have a camera that is capable of ripping off 7 or more photos per second, using the auto drive trying to get that perfect action shot of either a smoke cloud, an open action with the spent casing flying through the air or some other cool action shot, you will get a bunch of these photos showing a bullet streak. It's not hard, it's just knowing your camera, your lighting and a bit of luck. The bullet's speed has very, very little to do with it.

My use of a specific speed was not an absolute, it was not intended to be a 100% representation of what was captured in that reporter's photo. It was intended to show that the photo is not only possible, but pretty easy to get with a bit of luck (or in this case, bad luck)

"I don't think this is a problem related to physics, although I have witnessed it often in physicists. The adage that we all die alone - that only you have access to the full richness of your internal experience - came from philosophy, not physics, after all.

I don't think anyone, in any context, is ever going to fully appreciate the experiences of another human being. You can find people who seem to get bits and pieces, if you're lucky, and hopefully find a community of people around you that together build up to a bigger whole, but that's not specific to physics, either. In academia, the drive to move around a lot and never put down roots until quite late really hurts our ability to build that community, and so does the implicit pressure to socialize with people in your silo. That is something that upsets me about academia, but it's all of academia, not just physics. 


My partner is a professor of public health, and I'm a professor of physics. I hope that I understand the jist of her work, and I really try to, but I don't have the training to get the details and the nuance. But lots of stuff we share - the stress of the tenure process, and the politics of department life - she gets, and lives. And I'd say that's even the same of previous partners I've had who worked outside of the academy, in law of medicine or even routine engineering work. Likewise, my PhD supervisor has become a good friend after graduation, and I really look forward to catching up at conferences, where he gets a lot of the field specific minutia that my partner doesn't. He's obviously not the same type of support I find from my partner, but he's important to me for the place he holds just the same. This community can come in surprising places. A good friend of mine is a clown - we met at the gym, apparently clowning is hard work - and believe it or not, a lot of the struggles of the creative process translate really well to art and it's made us very close.

As your career progresses, the time between each subsequent discovery slows, because you're not reading about discoveries of the past and absorbing them, but waiting for them to happen through your own or your peers work. That can be disheartening, but teaching and mentorship allows you to keep a hold of a big portion of it. Supervising my PhD students is *by far* the most rewarding part of my career, and undergraduate teaching is second. Service is also very high and research has honestly fallen quite low on that list (though still something I enjoy). 

Finding meaning and satisfaction from our career is one of the most difficult things we face in life. Not as physicists, but as people. I would challenge you to find a single professional-related subreddit where you can't find a post like yours. I don't say that to minimize your feelings: quite the opposite, it emphasizes how big they are. But I can't help but think that your choice of field isn't the biggest issue here, unless there is something really fundamentally spiritually incompatible between you and the field, which it doesn't sound like from your writing about undergrad or grad school. It sounds a little to me from the little that you wrote that you're trying to gain too much of your life's satisfaction from your career. It's a big part of your life, but it's not the whole thing. 

If this isn't something you've talked to your wife about, that is absolutely the place I'd start.

"But that isn't about averaging in time of exposure but actually how many photons were captured for each pixel. The point is if you take some time to capture pixel whatver you capture this with it will be average in that time. The average for bullet trail will be so it took only 1/20th (at best) of that time of actual bullet. 
Though yes it is all about relative intensities between bullet and background. If bullet actually reflects light and is lets say 10 times as bright, it will be properly captured. The coating is reflective so it is possible. I guess it might be in the range of 100 times brighter, so yes it is possible. I guess it might even be visible for longer but the reflection only takes a fraction of its visible path.

">Define ""desire,"" ""free,"" ""external,"" and ""agent"" and maybe you'll have an actual definition that can be discussed. 

I'll just use dictionary definitions, with a tweak here or there. 

Desire, a conscious feeling of wanting to have something or wishing for something to happen

Free, not limited or controlled by a factor. https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/free.

It's the same concept as used in physics. ""In physics and chemistry, a degree of freedom is an independent physical parameter in the formal description of the state of a physical system"" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(physics_and_chemistry)

External, coming or derived from a source outside the subject affected. So from something that doesn't form the physical body of the person.

Agent, a person or thing that produces a particular effect or change.

"There is no parallel universe/multiverse theory. A theory is an explanatory hypothesis that has been rigorously tested and is congruent with the available data.

Multiverse hypotheses, on the other hand, are not well tested. It may or may not be true that our reality is composed of multiple, perhaps infinite, universes, but there is currently no way to test this kind of hypothesis, and therefore, it is just speculation, not a scientific theory.

>does that mean that there is a parallel universe where the parallel universe theory does not apply?

I'm not sure this question makes sense. Are you asking whether there could be a universe within our multiverse that is somehow disconnected from the rest of the multiverse in a way that makes it functionally as though there were no multiverse from the perspective of someone living within that universe?

If so, then you could argue that that is the state of our universe. Our lives are unaffected by whether or not the multiverse exists, and we have no means of testing for its existence.

"I’ve commented this before on this sub, and it seems a lot of people seemed to agree with this sentiment so I’ll do the same here.

I think sometimes our want to change the world, sort of morphs into a need, especially in the field of physics because we constantly see and experience what it’s offered to us as a human race.  And so when our research inevitably doesn’t always end up changing the world, it feels rather defeating.

So instead, this is how i think of it.

Any amount of research or work you do contributes to the field, no matter how small.  Maybe it’s not going to be the thing that collectively changes the world, but perhaps your paper will inspire someone down the line, or be the key missing element to something they needed to complete their work.

"We observe the things we describe as chairs and tables. We don't observe counterfactual realities. I don't observe the concept ""chair"" or ""table,"" just like I don't observe any counterfactual evaluations of a casual model that don't instantiate in reality.

Realism following from phenomonelogical experience is a pretty silly concept to me to begin with, since it's essentially a rehash of the is-ought problem, but for metaphycics. But at least with most questions surrounding physical realism, we actually observe the things in question, as bundles of sensory experience we commonly define as belonging to categories of ""chairness"" or ""tableness"" in varying degrees, for example.

The purpose of the analogy to geometry was to emphasize that to claim the realism of something (free will) that has no instantiable (as opposed to potential) access to a constituent part (worlds in which alternate choices were made) makes no sense. Similarly, it makes no sense to talk about the ""quadrangleness"" of an observed three sided object, even if that object could be made ""quadrangle"" by cutting off a corner, at least at the macro scale. Obviously the number of sides we assign to the description of an object is dependent on the scale at and method with which that object is measured.

Modal logics admit a sort of implied metric to evaluate similarity among different possible worlds, which could be interpreted as a sort of way to ""observe"" counterfactuals if we take the instantiated reality as a sort of weighted superposition over nearby worlds. Unfortunately, that seems a bit forced to me, especially since it just kind of kicks the can down the road by necessitating the realism of those modal superpositions.",r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZGFyeS03Z29VcC05WG52YkpmOWVFTDlYTHhwZEJ0aUZNb2VmdFBYdV9EUjcyNHUwbmZpWVNPT014UEp2UnNDczhPTXRyN1R5bnJDNHU4ZGt1QVloaFE9PQ==

Forced by what? Because if it's the laws of physics then the answer is yeah, you need counterfactuals. We only observe the actual universe, and while we have models predicting alternative phase trajectories, they're still just models. We don't observe (and can't make measurements of, yet anyway) whatever ""thing"" is doing the forcing (e.g. a set of non-local hidden variables).

If it's some notion of consciousness/choice doing the forcing, then I suggest you look into research such as [this](https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/new-insights-into-the-neuroscience-behind-conscious-awareness-of-choice) so you can make a more informed opinion.

I'm guessing one way to solve this would be to model the contraption with corresponding electrical components, capacitor, inductor, resistor, and battery, and then use control theory to derive an impulse response formula for the system in the Laplace domain. Then apply convolution with the input signal to get the output.

A physics way of solving the problem would be, as you mentioned, to analytically ascertain what the equilibrium of the system would be under a constant force, and whether the system will even have time to reach the equilibrium. Based on my understanding, the equilibrium under the given constant force would be when the either sides of the damper has a relative velocity of 1/2 m/s, the block M would be moving with a constant velocity, and the block m would be experiencing the entirety of 1kN of the force. Since neither the spring constant, nor the mass m is enough to sustain the block m in equilibrium state, the block m will be suspended at 90°, with the tension bearing the brunt of the force.

No, it would be a person, which you could define as a physical body.

My guess would be since you have a dampener in there you will never actually get close to your equilibrium state in the first second.

At equilibrium the speed of everything is either constant or 0, looking at the system assuming constant speed doesn't make sense because of what it implies physically. the other option is the speed is 0 meaning no force is transferred through the damper.

The third option is pretending the damper is only transferring the force directly to the pendulum, but if thats the case, and assuming the cart cant be lifted (other wise there is no solution) i have no idea how to calculate the angles since, both the spring and damper pivot and no lengths are given.

I would agree that solving industry-facing problems is more difficult and less glamorous, but I would argue it offers a much higher return on investment. 

Academic learning (e.g., solving stat mech text book questions) is valuable and a necessary foundation, but it's  a flight simulator - an approximation to a real world problem with simplifications so that you can learn.

"I understand that effect, but that's not what I'm talking about. The advertised salaries in Spain (to me, other physicists I know who actually did move there, and profs there told me this is how they do it) include the *employer* tax. So Spain, like the US and many places, has basically two kinds of income tax. One the employee pays which, as you point out, depends on a bunch of other stuff. But there is also another one which the employer pays. In the US and many other countries, the advertised salary is the amount spent *after* the employer tax is paid. In Spain, some people advertise the total hit of the job to the employer which is *before* the employer tax is paid.

So, for example, suppose a person's income tax is 20% and the payroll tax is another 20%. In Spain, if they advertise a job for 3k/month, then the person actually only actually takes home 1.92k/month. But for the same tax rates in other countries, a job that is advertised for 3k/month the take home would be 2.4k/month (but would cost the employer more).

That's a capacitor. Sitting in sunlight, UV would have been acting to break down the polyethylene.

"The path of a King Bach fan is not an easy one

Then in a social settings, your life is centered around referencing King Bach Funny Moments Vine Compilations, probably the best experience. In watching King Bach Funny Moments, you have ups and downs, but in general, you live the life of an comedic genius and end up being an influencer, so life is good.

Then you finish your compilation video, get out of YouTube, and realize you dedicated the last 4-6 years of your life into something that is only a spoonful. The probability of having a single person in your hometown understand more than two references to King Bach vines is slim to none, let alone someone in your age group. Life is lonely when 80% of what you do in life can't be shared with anyone else. Back to the crib!

fwiw im a Claremont Colleges student at Mudd and I think quite a few physics majors cross populate between the schools. Mudd is really good as a STEM school despite being classified as a LAC for some and it's a lot easier to with opportunitiea like summer research at Mudd. I'd imagine it's very similar if you were to go to Pomona,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnbmU1eHF6LVhLdW5zVVJYcU9USGFrMXBPWU9oSkVCWWJGWXVDNm9qS2w3anc3dk5IajA3clVSWmhNM0N4b29EWGhNeVVYRUJTUjdha0ZJOHNPT3FDZkE9PQ==

"Listen man, I know you’re feeling bad, but you need to realize that no matter how much time has passed, you ARE the old you. If you’re not happy doing what you’re doing, it’s never going to spontaneously get better. It mainly seems like you feel isolated in your life and career. Have you tried joining some sort of group for a hobby that is entirely new to you? Having a defining passion in physics is beautiful, but you can bond with people and find a place to belong doing all sorts of things you may have never even thought of before. Something active like biking or hiking is a great place to meet new people, while also being active which is always good for mental/physical health. 

Hearing the way you talk about your career sounds like you feel as though you’ve sacrificed your life and career in something you aren’t enjoying anymore, or that has not had a payoff you feel is worth what you’ve put in. 

It’s easy to get distracted and turned for a loop listening to other people’s opinions and expectations for you, but you need to consciously internalize the fact that the literal only thing at all that matters at the end of the day is whether or not you’re happy where you are and who you’re with. This is a LOT easier said than done and is guaranteed to create interpersonal conflict; even so, who cares? I’ve had to break out of a situation similar to yours before, and it takes guts and balls of steel to be honest with the people around you, not to mention the feeling you’re jumping into the unknown. It is never like that though, and these things can be massively dramatized in our heads.

Something that stands out a lot to me is your idea that the more of a “physicist” you become, the less “human” you become. This is a train of thought headed for certain doom. You ARE human. You have needs that aren’t being met. The fact you feel the way you do proves this. If you are exhausted and unhappy devoting every waking second to this career that makes you feel not even human, actually and seriously consider leaving. Yea yea yea it’s hard for everyone, but have some perspective and never fall for the sunken cost fallacy. 20 years from now, will you have worked another 20 years doing something that makes you unhappy, or will you have built something entirely new that brings you joy? You are never going to think on your deathbed “man I wish I hadn’t stopped busting my ass doing that thing I hate.”

I care about what you’re saying because it’s something that’s so easy to fall into, and I genuinely hope you find your way out. At the absolute very least, don’t push yourself so hard. If your job really requires constant learning and blahblahblah, it sounds like a horrible and screwed up place to work that shouldn’t be expecting you to do what you’re doing for them. No matter what they’re having you do, there’s not a chance it’s as important as you feeling like you’re happy.

I know all these things might sound corny; I’m just a behavioral neuroscientist talking to a bunch of physicists so I feel like I’m basically speaking Japanese right now, but if you read this I think you should consider what I’m saying with an open mind. Everything you just expressed is THE equation for chronic depression and suicidal ideation.",r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnX0NJa3E2N2ZoYko1QVJxNUlySExnX1pUZ0J3VEVlSUtPTDB4THJObVRjQVN0emppVTlrdWM3NTNaUGh6d1FOMXBmb1c1RjVUYTRaaGt4LU5OSmNXdHVkdk1fV3JWa005bm5YMndCM2dHUG89
"As someone who taught 9th grade physics for 5 years, the best thing you can do to prepare yourself is brush up on your algebra skills: basic order of operations, solve for the missing variable, finding the slope on a graph. Depending on your school, you may be learning some of this in your 9th grade math class at the same time. Either way my strongest students were always the ones who knew how to do the math.",r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnZGtpZ3F0Y2VkaG5XT3JEdlVKV1BYQWxHaWpaOWFlODZZNElJbmwyYjRMVFBQZHpFNk01MUNnU21aVlpyd3R3NWw5Sl9hbkFyOFFtdkxIUERKNmxBOHc9PQ==
