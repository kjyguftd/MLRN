"Personally, I think it is because of Zionism, the perception of Zionism, and the hatred of Zionism.


With respect to the Palestinian/Israeli conflict, the world sees this as Jews oppressing/attacking Muslims. 


Whereas, when the powerful Kingdom of Saudi Arabia attacks the Houthis in Yemen (or Yemeni civilians), there's less of a 'knee-jerk' emotional story because Muslims are attacking Muslims. 


The same for the Syrian Civil War which has claimed some 600,000 lives. 


If our western society removed the perception of race/heritage, and just saw these as atrocities equal in horror, then the media would certainly give more coverage to the Syrian Civil War. 


Perception is everything in the world-wide-web... facts can be obfuscated by the silver tongued. 


I think it is atheism and a general distrust of all global religions and governments (both abroad and domestic) that allows someone like me to have the perspective and world-view that I have.",r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZV01xdlNFaXhEV01LX25TTzJuRkNxa1AxSmRfa2hxWndZR3NiZTI4WTlHQU1oTXZTeWRvclZOVTY3NnhGZ1RKNWN2czNYZGluMGpGczUtOE04cVByZUE9PQ==

"Most of Democratic leadership isnt stupid, the public is.  The problem is that Democrats in leadership positions do not want to give up power within the party by pushing potential candidates not beholden to them.

Newsom, Buttiegeg, Whitmer are not winning national elections for a variety of reasons.

Kamala Harris would be fine if the Biden administration hadnt kept her from picking up Bidens slack and Progressives hadnt sabotaged her.  And then there is the problem with the country still being racist and sexist as fuck.

Democratic leadership would need to promote a political unknown, a moderate to conservative Democrat from the House whos name hasnt been trashed by the media.  They would need to reverse any strong position on unpopular wedge issues like gun control and just run on reducing cost of living, and issues that have broad support.  Not bullshit that Democrats pretend have broad support but actual policy that in fact does have broad support.

This next budget there are no spending increases for anything except defense spending while we have had population increases and rising inflation and consumer prices.  Its going to be an absolute cluster fuck.  Any potential candidate who brings policy to the table to counter act the impending shitstorm is going to be strongly welcomed.

The majority of the Democratic voter base is moderate to conservative Democrat, they are not Progressives.  The demographics needed to win over are rural and younger voters....So unbanning TIkTok, ending weapon sales to Israel, and shutting up about gun bans.

The path forward is telling all those voices to shut the fuck up, that they are the cause for this mess in the first place.  It was Sanders who caused Trump to get elected in the first.  His campaign gained unauthorized access to Clintons DNC server right before its contents were leaked.  His campaign was spreading negative messaging in rural communities suppressing the Democratic vote.  He was the one who was a routine guest on Russian state media like Russia Today, appearing regularly for interviews and the Ed Shultz show.

There is a large pool of potential candidates to choose from who are not controversial.  Pick a moderate to conservative female Democrat or a more moderate left leaning male candidate thats half Bidens age that most of the country has no fucking clue who they are.  Tell them to shut up about gun control and push policies to stop the consolidation of business and the manipulation of the markets by investment firms and private equity ....And Democrats win.

You could pull Joseph Kennedy III hes a white redheaded left leaning whatever get him to never talk about guns again.  And say some shit about reducing consumer prices and ending climate change.

Abigail Spanberger again have her shut up about gun control and Israel, then have her focus on the economy as it relates to lower income Americans.

"Both your arguments are based on false premises, and tired, ineffectual arguments.

1 wouldn't happen in reality, because the company isn't making more money, it is just limiting CEO pay. The company would not be able to pay the janitor 500k because it would mean paying EVERY janitor 500k in the whole company. What it would do is lower the CEO pay by millions, and probably raise the janitor pay by a little bit. Sadly, the reality is that the CEO is greedy, and would probably find other ways to cheat the system anyways, so fuck the CEO. 

2 is not an argument in good faith either because the reality of the situation is that teenagers are rarely working a full time job for any extended period of time, and OP said nothing about anyone needing to be on salary. If they are, then most likely, they ARE supporting their family, and would need those kinds of wages. By your metric, who is somebody that ""actually should be on minimum wage""? Do they not deserve to make enough money to live in an area if they are working a full work week?

I think we could maybe agree that minimum wage should be set by the cost of living in an area, and not an arbitrary number that tries to be a one size fits all. Nobody's saying that a fast food worker needs to be able to afford a luxury one bedroom apartment, but every place in America has data on how much it costs, at a minimum, to live there. 
Paying someone $15/hr might work great in a non-urban college town that has housing affordable to that wage, let's say $800/month per person, where up the highway an hour north in the bigger city, $15/hr might be poverty wages and completely livable, because even $1400/month gets you a 85 year old slum house. On the flip side, and hour east in nowhere ass rural shit holes, $15/hr might be too much that it puts local businesses under, but it's also unnecessary because rent is like $450/mo for a 3 bedroom house that can be shared.

If the stock price increases by a large margin over a decade or so, and the executives show a much larger compensation number as a result (which doesn’t change a companies available cash), does this really mean you need to drastically raise everyone else’s salary, even if there’s not enough cash to cover it? Do you cut their salary when the stock price falls?

"I agree that things need to change for low wage earners. I don't think that going after the CEOs is necessarily the way to do it. 

Let's say the law passed today. Big companies contact out a lot of low paying jobs so those smaller companies would be on the hook for dealing with the new salary formula that this law is meant to help. 

Going back to big companies, I am betting that the current executives would be grandfathered into their current contract. Otherwise they would likely quit. If they are grandfathered there's no salary savings to pay for the lower end salaries to be boosted.

And a lot of folks say health insurance shouldn't be tied to a job. That's a paid benefit. Our state has expanded medicare and while it's not perfect I think that might be a solution to look at.

"There's plenty we could just ***stop doing wrong*** in this area in the US.  It's our policies and our wealth driving CEO pay to absurd levels abroad and even in the nonprofit sector.

\\* In the US until 1993 we taxed companies for executive compensation above 1 million dollars - we did not allow them to deduct it as an expense.  Removing that rule for the top 5 highly paid executives receiving ""performance pay"" is part of what opened the floodgates for the income inequality that has developed.  The rule was put back in place in 2017.

\\* In the US until the 80's we had halfway effective antitrust regulation, but have stopped enforcing that competition almost entirely, leading to multiple rapid waves of corporate merger and acquisition activity.

\\* The entire idea of private equity and the leveraged buyout has turned financial incentive structures on their head since a series of regulatory changes culminating in 1981.  This tends to weed out smaller corporations of modest profit and modest growth opportunities, which effectively get stripped for parts.  The larger corporations end up with their market.

\\* Stock option compensation is treated very differently from normal compensation, and getting paid in 10-year-vesting stock options is a multiplier on several of compensation even if the company doesn't actually gain market share.  On top of that, once vested stocks are treated differently from cash in terms of income, and may not end up being ""realized gains"" at all if you treat them like a slush fund in collaboration with banks who effectively 'rent' the stock.",r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcmtPV3ZlYmpCanVmSnJPYkFZYVhUUVBiSEExWUpWbWhUaGM5X2JpNWR2c3hPRGFEN2d0eXZxeGpJUklOcFVYdkQyek1mT21icmtOZWg1TEF5UE9JeXc9PQ==

After that I would rather use taxes as a way for companies to regulate that themselves. In short some companies pay little to no taxes because of tax breaks. I would cap tax breaks at a certain percentage unless everyone at the company makes at least X amount and the average salary, excluding management, makes at least this much and management has to make more than the average to keep companies from saying a cashier is the also the manager of that cash register or some stupid thing like that.

>Apple is one (1) company that sells to markets across the globe. French firms are free to do so too in theory.

Yes, in theory. But it's obviously easier to sell within a country than across national boundaries ... which makes it easier for large countries to develop large companies. 

In addition, the US has the largest English-speaking market in the developed world - *by a massive margin* - which too makes it easier to sell consumer products here. 

Finally, and most importantly, the US appears far more forgiving of monopolistic behavior which allows for massive companies to balloon here in a way that would not be permitted in other economies. So the fact that Apple is so massive isn't something to boast about - it just points to the existence of corporate lobbying (considered bribery in other places), and the ability of corporations to influence politicians easily in the US.",r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcF96ZmRHTGpHQVdyV1Y3c21SVnZJUldOQjc4UTNFbkQtUDAwVUZnUEhEbkVXQWkwN3ZmWC1wRmZZa2VRRTNMdHBGWWpZYndUbXVvRk4yVkdzTzRtVFV0bVZfTXQ0MF9PWTJobnhlaU1xVGs9

"So the idea of ""Law 1"" isn't new. It was coined by Tinbergen, the first Nobel Prize winner in economics. The Tinbergen norm was never implemented, although it existed in a ""softer"" form of almost-confiscatory tax rates for very high incomes that some economies, such as the United States, had in the postwar period (up to 92% in 1952).

Tinbergen did end up having a major role in setting up the economic model that later became known as the ""polder model."" The ""law 2"" was passed in 1965 (all rich European countries have similar laws).

"Its political violence brought to a boil. There were always these threats but one *actually* happening with all the visuals of blood on TV is going to a cold bucket of public. Trump world is rallying and unifying but its a good opportunity for Biden to take and try to unify the nation in the fallout. Theres a new opportunity for both campaigns to try and heal the nation to tackle real issues. Whether any sides do will be up to them.   

The shooting helps Biden because it takes the media spotlight away from his age and discussions of a replacement. It has the chance to solve the issue too if people get too distracted by this and suddenly become okay with Joe going into the convention. This will take up several days of the news cycle and give Joe much needed time.  

From a historical standpoint, its going one of those moments where you remember where you were. Im seeing the photo of Trump surrounded by Secret Service, covered in blood with his fist raised an American flag in the background and its Pulitzer material. Regardless of political affiliation this is a former president and candidate successfully getting shot and surviving an assassination attempt on tv is unprecedented.",r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZeFVLQXBMM3lHU01LMzViRlZvMkxyQjd0OVNuQ3Jha3NmZXBtOFZwdlJiLXktWmJ1UEZyWXFjeFhYUlAzYWt1ZHJEZ01SNmdZUFhEeWJHMFQ5RENLbVE9PQ==

"Imo if there is one person that wins in this situation, it's Trump. He's been doing his damndest to paint himself as a victim, fighting for the people in the face of tyranny, and this whole situation only goes to bolster that claim.

"There's no way of knowing for sure until the shooter's identity and motives are known.

If they were a leftist, this will be fuel on the fire of the QAnon conspiracy train and will convince many more Republican and MAGA voters that the left is a violent despotic tyrant group that wants to silence and kill them (or white people in general as some white supremacist supporters of Trump posit). Trump's base and his campaign will benefit strongly from the imagery, and they may even get religious about it saying he was saved by God.

If they were alt-right, it could push the infighting that Republicans are already dealing with over the edge. Certain notable white supremacist and Christian nationalist factions have felt ""burned"" by Trump recently, including people like Nick Fuentes. It's also possible that it was someone whose money he stole under the guise of support for his ""campaign"", or the stupid Trump-coin-style scams, etc. 

If they were neither, there's a good chance this is over the recent Epstein-related testimony about Trump raping two thirteen year old girls. In which case this will be a disaster for Trump, because the one thing that will still (at least superficially) enrage pretty much anyone to the point of violence is child abuse, and his supporters might turn on him with enough attention drawn to that information.",r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcDc2Wnk5enlJdmo0REs2VlJCYmFWNzc0N3l5WV9uaERSdU9GeHdMZ1plXy1SbUFIMWllb2MyeDhMbTlpMEJxU2FaNndDSFlKX1JuTjdxdDJKTS1vY2c9PQ==

"This would be best answered by a lawyer and burden of proof for charges. primarily, insurrections are organized, and it could and most likely would be argued that individuals were not a part of that organization. So even if the jury believed 95% they were a part of an insurrection, there would be that 5% of doubt, so doesn't fit the burden of proof. However, seditious conspiracy, enemy of the US, assault, etc. were able to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

it's the same for most criminal cases. They don't just charge someone with one thing. They also include other similar charges and even lesser charges. first degree murder, first degree manslaughter, assault with a deadly weapon, attempted murder,  whatever.

"I don’t just think Trump has actively added to the increase in political violence. I think he’s also actively encouraged people to have less faith in democracy and fair elections, and he’s also encouraged people to have less faith in the FBI, our government, and the justice system. 

I think it’s horrific that anyone would ever engage in political violence, so it’s clearly a bad thing when it’s used against Trump. I’m also not surprised that it happened, given all of the above. 

This isn’t just the democrats rhetoric being taken at face value. It’s also a result of the desperation and hopelessness that Trump’s rhetoric has helped elicit. 

That things have come to this fever pitch is definitely not solely on the shoulders of democrats. At every possible turn, MAGA have sought to turn up the temperature in this country. There was never any attempt whatsoever by Trump to turn it down. It excites him. 

Does that mean he deserves to get shot? Of course not. But let’s not pretend that this extreme bullshit is purely a Democrat problem. 

It’s been building up to this. This isn’t a sudden singular event. A dude came at Pelosi with a hammer and got her husband instead. 

The floodgates on political violence have been opened for a while now. You don’t get to wash your hands of this and pretend this is purely a liberal phenomenon. 

We’re probably going to see a lot more violence coming from multiple unhinged camps. 

Now would be an amazing time for Trump to denounce political violence of every flavor and to beg Americans to turn down the temperature.

Shit happens, but to say this will spark the end times is dramatic. Normal people just don't decide to start killing people because their guy got shot at. People value their own life in America, and very few have been willing to give it up to end a political rival.

"This seems like a curse at first. Greatest propaganda piece ever! To be point yes, it’s good imagery. Though the more I think of it, the more this is gonna be forgotten by the general public. What I mean is that it’s going to be a anecdote in a long list of events. Jan 6th, the guilty verdict, biden’s debate performance. Only in select circles is this gonna be a shift.

 
And aa much as people are concerned with radical violence in the election. With Trump, it would’ve been a natural descent into that as we got to November. What has occurred is that the intensity of the election arrived Today July 13th and with that I am intrigued by what occurs.

The rallies are not gonna really matter. Whether he comes intensely or not. The general public has gotten a decade of a caricature by the media. This will matter to the base of the conservative, liberal and the extremist sides.

The only true question is ultimately, by the time we get to election day. Which base will be motivated more by. 

Unfortunately, there might be an attempt on Biden. How much of a rallying cry does that become for the left. What if Biden steps down and we get a new candidate. Is simply being new enough to actually win the election.

There is a part of me, that because the parties have become such a part of the candidate’s persona. That should either of them not make it, then the new candidate is not gonna matter as much as how much personality and energy of the old candidate they can bring and whoever fails loses the election. (2016 Trump and 2020 Biden as reference)

The corporatist natural-aristocratic duopoly we have now is bad enough, but they want to monopolize the government and set us back decades if not centuries. This man did an incredibly brave thing.

Well this was not a security breach this was an assassination attempt. Sources say that the Biden campaign is looking to remove negative campaign ads against Donald Trump. So hopefully this can be a moment of self-reflection and some healing fingers crossed.

"When debates started, they were run with proper rules and the participants took it seriously.   Since Reagan snipped the Fairness Doc and  Murdoch got Fox News on the air, all of the news media started looking for clickbait headlines to attract viewers & readers.  The media without the requirement to focus on facts, started repeating GOP opinions & misinformation as if they were facts - never demanding evidence or providing an in-depth analysis.  They pretended that Reagan’s trickle down theory would work. They ignored his racism in calling the people in cities lazy & pretended GOP was accurate when saying there were many illegal voters to justify their voter suppression.  The media (with few exceptions of individual shows like Rachel Maddow & Joy Reid) is now fully in the hands of rich white men & the GOP.  Anyone who does not see this is not paying attention - just like the Germans in 1933.  It was most obvious when the media treated T as a viable candidate and weaponized every lie the GOP had ever told about HRC.  

One cannot have an actual debate with anyone like T.  There was zero fact checking by Jake Tapper’s team.   RIDICULOUS!  A debate requires facts.  Then they judged the man who used facts & evidence as having failed, while the liar & man who speaks in word salads was NOT criticized.  T refuses to say he will accept the results of our election, yet the media does NOT call for him to be excluded from running.

Joe has always had difficulty with debates & the root is his stuttering.  The fact that he does it anyway shows his character.  I’m 77 and cannot always find the right word or remember names.  (But I’ve always had a problem with names.). However my intelligence is still present in full.  I went back to work briefly for a former employer recently because they were in need of someone to lead a department.  I hadn’t lost my leadership skills. Neither has Biden.  Remember the media repeated GOP’s claim that HRC was not healthy enough to be president because she had pneumonia during the campaign.  How many times are people going to ignore the fact we no longer have news media protecting our democracy with truth.

Bottom line, if you want a good debate like the old days, then force the GOP to change their platform (project 2025) by not voting for any GOP at any level until we see a platform like the last good GOP president - Eisenhower.  His taxes on the richest was over 70%.

I understand that. You’re in policy wonk territory though, which means the point doesn’t land. The people in question see the Fed as part of the government, and the President controls the government—thus anything that the Fed does is done at the behest of the President.

"Will likely galvanize his base and encourage more non-voters that support him to go to the polls. With no one exactly enthusiastic about Biden due to his age to begin with, it could be the deciding factor in the election.

Given the attempt, most media outlets will likely avoid negative press about Trump for awhile. Conservatives will no doubt try to blame the Democrats as a whole for points with their base despite what that incites, rather than a lone crazy person. Fearmongering is particularly effective for authoritarian bases.

If Trump wins it'll likely be used for reasoning behind whatever extreme stuff he wants targeting perceived enemies when in reality it was just one deranged psycho. And with Project 2025 post attempted coup, it'll spell the end of Democracy in the US.

Win or lose, it will be heavily used for rhetoric. They'd be stupid not to. Violence will likely be incited. An already heated election with heavy tensions on both sides will become much worse.

Trump supporters will likely feel more validated taking extreme actions, violence or otherwise. Some non-violent results might include (more) extreme policies, judicial rulings, movements, which may be particularly targeted.

In short, likely the direct opposite of the shooter's intent. Sought to eliminate Trump from the race (among other things), likely handed it to him. Ironic, really.

I'd question it provoking some deranged Trump supporter to make an attempt on Biden as him leaving the race would frankly be doing the Democrats a favor. Even the insane probably realize that. Though with a tense atmosphere there's no telling what will happen.

From some other threads I've seen, most commenters from both left and right seem to be making fairly logical statements. Left seems more focused on what the negative results will be for their side. Right seems more focused on the understandable concern that this happened in the first place and that it shouldn't ever happen and that it seems crazy to them that those on the other side seem so concerned about themselves instead. There's definitely some fighting though, have seen some right side commenters emboldened to make wild claims about the left and saying things like they deserve anything that happens to them as a result. Unclear if that's just base tribalization or actual escalated tension. I don't tend to read political shit slinging back and forth comment threads so it's hard for me to say.

">This could have easily just won Trump the election.  

I STRONGLY suspect that the shooter just handed Trump the election. I called my (boomer) father as soon as it was confirmed to be an assassination attempt and he said his first thought that it was an inside job. And honestly, the thought crossed my mind, too. To be clear, I do not think it was a conspiracy, but that WILL be the narrative. There's nothing we can do about it, this is simply America in 2024. 

Between Biden's numbers and all the pressure on him to step down and the Supreme Court ruling that the President is effectively immune to virtually anything, that's just where people's minds are going to jump. The president being allowed to order Seal Team 6 to take out a political opponent has been part of the national discussion for weeks now. And I can't even really blame people, because this is all so fucking strange. Why didn't Secret Service have someone on that rooftop? It had a clear angle on the politician they're protecting. It appears the counter-sniper took the suspect out almost immediately. You can't jump up on a rooftop, set up a rifle, aim and hit the target in under two seconds, so they clearly had someone with a weapon already trained on/near the shooter's location. How, in a post-JFK world, did the Secret Service allow this to happen?

"> Think small-town, rural markets, where there isn't money to support a commercial station but a nonprofit is able to make it work.  

What world are you living in that those places still exist?   

Those markets are more that covered by simulcasting a different station or simply rebroadcasting syndicated shows. The latter has dropped off over the past decade or so, but the latter is very much alive.   

“Nonprofit” also does not mean “light money on fire.” They’re competing for the same revenue stream (primarily advertising) regardless of what tax classification they fall into, and the larger stations have a massive leg up because they can simply drop in a transmitter and broadcast stuff recorded elsewhere once they swap the ad spots out and basically print money in the process.

"I have had this same thought. Here's how to make it happen. Offer a company a tax credit for low wage disparity. 

If a companies top 10 percent of earners do not make more than 10 times its bottom 10 percent full-time employees, they receive a tax credit of 2%.
You must include all forms of compensation. Otherwise, companies will then start buying neighborhoods and creating companytowns like during the Industrial Revolution. And paying their top tier employees with food, company script, shares, options, or some other form of compensation to get around this law. 
 
The decrease in wage disparity and increased investment in the company is easy pzy.

"I suggest waiting to quote changes in the UK and the NHS system as blocking access to Gender Affirming Care, something that was done by political conservatives - the same groups behind the push for Brexit, and likely was a contributing factor to the conservatives loss of the recent elections, the first time in 14 years they lost such elections. 

They are the only country that has done so, and did it as a result of a government inquiry lead by conservatives.

They also didn't ban their use, just the prescription to new recipients, as they can still be prescribed and covered by the NHS for people that were previously taking them.

The move was in response to a clinic that wasn't following the standard process of care for minors. A ***single*** clinic was not following the proper diagnosis criteria or process.

Yes, I think you need to get a bit of perspective. The US has an extreme problem with gun violence, but it is in no way normal to be shot and murdered. It should be treated as shocking. And mass shootings are an even more obscure way to die. There were 703 mass shooting deaths in 2021. A number that is 703 deaths too high. But it is a relatively small fraction of the 21 thousand gun murders that year or the 3.5 million deaths that year.

Mass shootings and gun violence are an urgent problem in the US.

"That is not what it is. Medical science says you're wrong and your ignorant ""opinion"" on the matter is worthless.

When and how did we come to the point that people with no background in medical science feel entitled to make sweeping statements about conditions they don't understand? Gender dysphoria is a recognized medical condition by doctors, therapists, and medical organizations worldwide.

The arrogance necessary to dismiss the consensus of medical professionals is staggering.

Do you have an opinion on quantum physics? On how to treat brain tumors? On the best methods for heart surgery? Hopefully not. Hopefully you recognize your lack of expertise in those areas. The same logic should apply here. If you don't have the medical knowledge, defer to those who do.

Keep your ""opinion"" out of other people's healthcare.",r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTDR5ME1GNnJsd0RqOGZjek5LeXhYeE0yTHV2bVlUQkZEMnBhVDd3SGNJVXRLWE9PUUdJREZKZTRSSjFkSTBFaU9DZW5QTFd4TE9ieWR0aXNzeWFMS0E9PQ==
"> Now it will galvanize his base and potentially increase voter turn out for them. Democrats will have to continue to push voter turn out for their side if they want to combat that.

Absolutely this will turn out his base. That picture of him with his hand raised in a fist with his ear bleeding is the best advertising you could never pay for. It even has that populist/fascist element of the fist raised. It's not easy to overplay the significance of this type of imagery / symbolism. It's a powerful gesture that touches a very primal part of the human psyche, especially during something so emotionally charged as an assassination attempt.

Then take into account the disastrous debate performance by Biden combined with his repeated gaffes (interview after debate, calling Zelensky Putin, calling Trump VP, etc)... It seems like everything is going wrong for Biden and Trump just got dealt a royal straight flush.

1.	Fuel prices are not determined nor impacted by presidential policy, they are the result of the global commodities trade which involves all of the world’s oil producers. The record low oil prices during Trump’s term were the result of a [Russo-Saudi price war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Russia%E2%80%93Saudi_Arabia_oil_price_war) combined with reduced demand due to COVID restrictions driving barrel prices sub-zero. 
2.	The [US became a net exporter of oil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_energy_independence) in 2019 and has maintained that trend every year since. 
3.	Keystone XL was an extension of the main Keystone pipeline (which still exists and continues to pump crude) that would’ve changed the US oil production rates at most 4% (500k/13M barrels per day) and the total global production rate by 0.5% (500k/90M).",r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaQ0YtWWJVQmx5WUZuRXJnUXdHZ3M0bHhWQjQ1Ty01WGhpdmMyaDI5cEhsM0w1Rl9ILV84eUdZaC1MSFViNVVLXzlKbkphNUNERFBId1pTempNOWlESlE9PQ==

Show me the rapist I’m defending. Again, he’s not listed as a sexual predator/rapist anywhere on the planet, aside from your own small brain.

>Bernie actually has a moral compass and thinks that rape is bad. He probably wouldn’t spend hours and hours trying to defend a rapist. Just a thought for you to hopefully reflect on.

"Lets flip this question on its head:

How likely is it that the democrats will pass a federal bill restrict the sale of assault rifles if they get elected to the presidency? 

You might see puberty blockers get banned for off label usage (aka trans kids). But that's about as far as it would get...  This isn't the worst thing, the study would take 2-4 years to do and likely get approved. However the warning label is likely NOT going to match the current rhetoric.... however we would be back to mostly where we are now. 

Candidly, this is the slippery slope of government involved in medicine. If we want trans people to have autonomy, then parental autonomy needs to be taken into account (that's a spectrum from vaccines to transfusions) and personal autonomy (abortion, smoking, drug use... ) , In our current political climate that's going to be an almost impossible conversation to have...

"There's several issues here that I'll try to articulate - please let me know if anything I say here is confusing, as I'm just trying to impart factual information and my own opinion.

First, the practical. Right now, no medicine or practice - save HRT and gender-affirming interventions - alleviates symptoms of gender dysphoria, that's why it's the standard of care. The brain is largely a black box; we don't know enough about how it works to target medication for specific areas or effects, it's all trial-and-error. That makes creating new drugs very expensive, and because trans folks make up less than half a percent of the US population, nobody's going to bother spending that money; there's no profit to be made from successfully making it, due to a low patient population.

Next, the ethical. If we somehow gained the ability to ""cure"" gender dysphoria, in the sense that we could remove all desire to be of a gender other than the one attributed to you by your birth sex, should we? It sounds obvious, but I will explain the dilemma using another mental health disorder: autism. If we could ""cure"" autism (I am speaking of ""mild-to-moderate"" autism, where people can live and function independently) should we? It is considered a disorder, to be sure, but that is because autistic individuals are different from non-autistic individuals. For many autistic folks, the way their brain works is a core part of their identity; to remove that from them, to fundamentally change how their brain thinks, is in a philosophical sense, turning them into a different person. Is that right to do? Would it be better to structure society so that autistic folks are better catered to; that social skills are explicitly taught rather than just heavily implied and left for kids to figure out? I know someone who's autistic and is amazing with money; the place she works for depends upon her head for numbers. That company would be worse off if she was not autistic.

To speak more personally, I am a trans person myself. If you offered me a pill that would remove my gender dysphoria and leave my body the way it is, I would not take it. My trans-ness is a core part of myself, and to remove that is to erase a part of who I am - why would I do that? Just because it's easy? Because I make some people uncomfortable? That's regretable, but I'm not giving that up any more than I would give up my love for trains or video games or chocolate.

For me, the real 'cure' to gender dysphoria is better manipulation of the body, not the brain. If surgery were such that we could sculpt the body like clay (more than simple augmentations and reductions; I'm talking growing or removing any body part you can think of, changing your height and face and hair, etc etc), there would be no issues.

"I've seen on innumerable cases right here in this very subreddit, /PoliticalDiscussion, many people insisting that republicans are unable to feel empathy, that they cannot be reasoned with, that they're all brainwashed and mind controlled and worship Putin, that they're all fascists and nazis (all 70 million of them are nazis), and on and on and on.

Its dehumanizing the other. They're not a person, they're just an NPC, a mindless stooge, an evil nazi. There can be no reasoning with them...and then what comes after this chain of thought?

If they're the enemy and there can be no reasoning with them, whats next? Violence.

And keep in mind, by pushing this apocalyptic narrative that every republican voter is literally, actually evil and a psychopath incapable of empathy, and they're all Christian nazis, they're going to paint you with the same kind of brush in return.

Hate begets hate. It turns into blood in the streets, which we saw just a few days ago. Trump survived through sheer dumb luck. One person in the audience was killed. Two others seriously wounded, all innocent bystanders.

...or if they're at a Trump rally, are they innocent according to your morality? They support Trump, so are they fair game to gun down too? Should the whole audience, all Trump supporters and voters been gunned down for enabling him?

"""Do the polls say that Biden cannot win or is it possible for Biden to still win the election?""

The polls will never say ""100% chance Biden can't win."" Not the way science works. It could be 99.99% unlikely, but still not impossible. Biden's not stupid; he knows this. And there is his out.

""If it is still possible for Biden to win this election, how?""

It's complicated. Several ways for Trump to win, one way for Biden. Find/read the following for in-depth analysis:

NYTimes: Biden’s Path to Re-election Has All But Vanished
 https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/12/opinion/biden-trump-electoral-map-outlook.html?smid=nytcore-android-share

""According to 538, before the debate Biden and Trump were tied nationally.""

National polls are completely meaningless. Democrats are constantly winning the national vote & losing the presidency. We don't have a national election ... we have 50 state elections. Biden is getting his ass kicked in swing state polls, which is all that matters. Plus, states that were viewed as ""likely"" or ""safe"" D a month ago are now becoming toss-ups (New Mexico, Virginia, Minnesota). Biden is only up single digits in New York, for Christ's sake. That is unbelievable! Some are suggesting this election, if Biden stays in, will be the biggest blowout since at least 2008.

""Despite this, 538 still considers the election a toss up.""

Nate must be on crack. That's a pipe dream.

""What would Biden need to do?""

Drop out. Be assassinated. Die in office before the election. Hope Trump somehow fucks something up so incredibly badly it throws the election. Those are about the only ways Biden wins.

""Can Biden win this election or is it truly lost?""

My money has been on Trump for the past year. Bidens too old, he fucked up Israel/Gaza horribly, he lied to the people about being a ""bridge"" to the next generation,  he ignored the wishes of the majority of voters in & out of his party that he not run again, and for the past 2-3 weeks - when he should have been dropping out & attempting to clean up his mess, he has effectively ruined the chance for another candidate to step in.

This is seriously the stupidest shit I have ever seen in electoral politics, and ive studied politics for fourty years. I used to be so-so on Biden from 2020-2022. I was very pissed he decided to run again. At this point, I hate him. I hate that selfish prick. Lots of stupid D's paved the way for corporations & the wealthy to win their 50 year campaign fighting the ""excess of democracy"" the Powell Memo railed against. Joe ""I am your only saviour"" Biden sealed the deal, though. My hate for him is pure.

This was long, I know, but on a sidenote:

I'm 57, and old X'er. I've always voted liberal/Socialist in primaries & D in the general if I had no choice. The Boomers - our parents - have never let us taste power, or at least only under their terms. But some in my generation have been just as bad as them. As a Neo-Marxist & humanist, I'd like to think I have a clear(ish) view of what the past few generations have done to ensure the political system, the environment, the economy - just about every major driver of human welfare - is completely fucked for Millennials, Z's, Alpha's & beyond. I am incredibly sorry for what I could have done, but either failed to do or was unable to accomplish. I can't say ""I'm sorry"" enough. But I can say this:

We will see civil war in the next 1-5 years, almost certainly. NOT seeing it may actually be worse for open-minded people than dealing with the shit now. Many of the elites from my & my parents generation are planning on leaving before things reach that point. New Zealand, France, elsewhere in Europe ... anywhere to avoid, at least for a bit longer, the Hell they/we created. Fuck them. I bought guns. I have no need or desire for war, but I will die before I see this country turned into a Christian fascist state. And for those who feel fine fucking all this shit up & leaving before the bill comes due - we'll, you gotta get out first, don't you?

It sounds weird, I know. I sound crazy to myself, sometimes. Take it as you will. Mock me, belittle me, down vote me (foresooth!), call me your brother, or school me if you think I'm wrong. But I'm sincere if nothing else.

Fare thee well, all. Peace.",r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaVDRFRnJoaUZyLXZPakJXS0xubk9GZ3JBaFZDVEVVa0p2cGZITEtNNXNyMUYydG1FSVI1QjEwRDdoNjA3WWZrNTVQby1RZFZMNE5KY3c2aVBRUnhlbzZNYXJZZTVvZmxoM3BzREt3SHVRaWs9
">Democrats will say we don't need firearms to prevent a fascist dictatorship, with the knowledge we might soon have a fascist dictator. 

To be fair I'm not American but if I was I wouldn't think me personally owning an assault rifle would prevent an American dictatorship.

When the government can roll tanks down my street or use a drone to drop nerve gas on me, my ability to bear arms isn't going to make a difference unless those arms include highly advanced million dollar weapons.

The true check on an American dictatorship has always been the states and their control of the national guard today, and militias of the past. In my opinion there will be a huge civil war before there is an American dictator, as the military will be split, the states will all call up their national guard, and the military will side with the various states the various commanders side with.

It would be just like the English civil war. On one side you'd have the single figure of authority who likely has to flee the capital and raise their banner elsewhere (Charles fled London and raised his banner in Nottingham, which was a fatal mistake as London is where the money was but he didn't have much of a choice). On the other you'd have a legislature who would expel everyone siding with the opposition and use their powers, money, and legitimacy to raise armies. If the legislature wins they will claim they acted based on the will of the people using the legitimate laws of the land which the opposition broke. If the dictator wins they will claim the legislature broke all the laws and was corrupt, and needed to be removed.

In that scenario I guess technically maybe everyone owning a gun helps but probably not. It would be long and bloody and whoever controls the nation's wealth is far more important than if you can save some money by having a BYOG militia.",r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaSV9aZFVNUGJSa01veGJldTl3czZDWG44S0VOcDNuZm9jeFhXd21WbjlXaU1kY19SaXRCOXpqNmlEbTRDNmdvWTFYaVdWUnlfOFRYckhYdE16T2FydFE9PQ==

">The U.S. lost the war in Afghanistan to people using weapons and firearms from the ww2 to the 80s...A lot of time even older.

Did they? 

You must have been watching a different war to me then. You see, the war I saw was that the US steamrolled through Afghanistan and took complete control of the instiutions of the country (for what they were, Afghanistan has always been very decentralised) very quickly. Whats more the US, while deployed there, controlled all major infrastructure, installed a new government (some would even say a puppet government that did what it want) and then kept it in place, until the US military withdrew.

The US ""lost the war"" in the sense that the ""goal"" of the war in Afghanistan was clearly lasting regieme change, and it was in fact only temporay because the US military propped up the regieme until it went away, and then it collapsed.

This in fact proves my point, and in fact aligns with every dictatorship on the planet. Military force is what is used to maintain dictatoships. When the US military has deployed, they have not been ""beaten"" by militias of guys with AK47s. They have ""won"" the conflict quickly and taken control of the government and de facto controlled the country.

The last time the American military ""lost"" to people using civilians with guns was Vietnam, but even then the Vietnamese were armed by China and Russia throughout the conflict. 

If the American military is ever deployed against the citizens of the US, all the assault rifles in the world won't let the civilians ""win"". 

>Democrats should have been pro gun for the simple fact that it would have helped them keep the House and gain a larger margin in the Senate.

That's just politics though, and while I don't neccessarily disagree with that statement, it doesn't change the fact that the original position was ""Democrats should be pro gun because we may have a fascist elected"".

"Okay, so maybe I'm totally off here and if so I'm completely open to criticism or being corrected - but am i alone in wondering how/why Trumps ear was bleeding? I understand some articles are saying the bullet ""grazed his ear"" but what mostly struck me as odd was that after seeing a few photos of Trump during the incident, I noticed something that's been bugging me. In the photo of Trump ducking down behind his podium, you see 3 drips (lines, etc.) of blood running down from his ear to his face, but in the photo when he's standing up right before getting ready to walk off stage he only has 2 drips (lines, etc.) of blood. Now I understand he could've wiped his face, or security or something/someone could've wiped or brushed that area wiping away one of the lines. However it's completely, completely gone. Like no smudge, no reminisce, no sign of any 3rd drip or line of blood coming from his ear down his jawline. If anything I'd at least be interested in hearing why that is.

"The only reason anyone even knows the name Merrick Garland, is because Obama tried to nominate him to replace Scalia. The only reason Obama chose him to begin with, was because before Scalia's body was even cold, Mitch McConnell, who was at that point the Senate Majority Leader, slithered into the Oval Office just to tell Obama that they weren't going to hold a vote to nominate anyone he picked. And so, Obama, remembering the words of his wife, Michelle who said ""They go low, we go high!"", decided that the ""high road"" was to just continue on and choose someone who was utterly bland, milquetoast, uncontroversial, and unassuming.  The kind of nomination that a functioning Senate should have no problem confirming. Merrick Garland. 

And he went and put Garland out in front of the media, thinking, ""I've got 'em now! Now they have to have a confirmation hearing and vote! Otherwise, they'll have to admit their actions had everything to do with dicking over liberals as hard as possible!""  

Unfortunately, they weren't bluffing. They said, with their full chest, that their decision to not hold a confirmation vote was all about dicking over liberals as hard as possible. They even took it a step further and said that should a Democrat win the Presidency (and they didn't even know who the Democratic nominee was going to be at that point), that they would keep Scalia's seat empty for as long as it took to get a Republican President.

Now, what should Obama have done? Well, he had a couple options. For starters, he could have chosen anyone he wanted. It didn't matter, the Republicans were going to block his appointment, regardless. Then, what he should have done, was put that appointment on the Bench without Senate confirmation. There is a legal precedent for this, and while it's a little bit ""extra-Constitutional"", if Republicans were going to break the rules, he was well within his rights to bend them.

But, coming back to the present, what should Biden do? Well, if he should win another term, he should fire Garland. Hell, the man probably wants to go home, anyway. He seems like he didn't really want the job to begin with and he didn't seem like he wanted to be on the Supreme Court back when Obama was still in office. Then, pick the most left-wing person he can find and put them in charge of the DoJ. Then, stack the ever-loving fuck out of the SCOTUS.

">Well, the US Constitution was ratified in what, 1788?

Interesting trivia. Can you tell me where in the constitution it says that Congress needs to ratify DOJ policy?

Was that around the time Trump was having special counsels appointed to investigate Biden? Can you link this argument?

>Wow, it really doesn't... Maybe you put the constitutional lawyer hat away for a bit before you hurt yourself.

Again, you are just repeating a narrative invented a couple of weeks ago, and I am basing my argument on the entire history of the Special Counsel policy as it has been approved, supported, and apportioned by congress numerous times. I'm referring to the actual debate when the independent counsel law was sunsetting, about how this DOJ policy would be the replacement.

You haven't referenced anything real yet. 

>CBO doesn't pass appropriations....

But congress does, and they have approved the apportionment of the funds associated with the independent counsel to fund the special counsel. The independent counsel law and its funding are two different laws, and only the first expired. The second remained, and was approved for use for special counsels. The CBO approved the use, and congress apportioned the funds.

They didn't need to. DOJ regulations took care of it. Everybody was good with this arrangement until Donald Trump needed a way out of trouble. 

>They are not, by the very regulation that you are citing.

[In California, they actually *did* have two simultaneous elections, one for the six-year term and one for the final weeks of the prior term.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_Senate_elections_in_California#General_elections)

The same thing will happen this year in California. There will be a special election to fill the final weeks of the term at the same time as the general election for the next six-year term. The incumbent is not running.

Tim Scott *did* have to win a special election. He was appointed in 2013, won the special election for the final two years of the term in 2014, and won a full term in 2016.",r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnMWpxUzhwVlhoREJWYmhJc1RORDAyVVJOdUY5UDRaVWQ2LTdqZHczVktMQ1EwbXZ4V3JtcGJyQnEteXdwTEk0dmNaRDF5TW54SHRCNWJ3dTA4R3NHV0E9PQ==
"Blaming a poor Secret Service response on Biden is some of the most senselessly inane politicking I’ve seen today, trailing only behind the “Biden ordered it” conspiracies.  

The idea that the President has or should have any say into how the Secret Service agents on the ground protect his political adversary is absurd and deranged. 

There is and should be a disconnect between him and their operations — imagine if in your scenario of accountability a President decided to limit or withdraw protection?  It’s nonsense to argue accountability in saying they should make it stronger without given them the power to make it weaker.  The FBI Director is also under the executive, yet is given autonomy to do their job as they see fit without Presidential interference, which would enable corruption.

If the President did have control over their opponent’s protection, that would enable corruption.

It’s a shameful argument and I don’t care what word salad arguments you try to throw back, because you are fundamentally wrong: the President is not responsible for actions of the Secret Service on the day in the moment and making such an argument is preposterous and politically motivated.

My opinion is apolitical: I had the same opinion that Trump should have had no power over protection of other former Presidents during his term either.

Blaming the shooting on the President is a stupid political talking point.",r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnN1BBSnhONU9fa3ZWa2c2azBMZW9XZEZwdkRjZEN6ZVhsQmF4VUl6UVY3QkJGRzRDdElTOXltSGphenh1VXFFTWQxY0FaNjNtbGNXUGVKUTVzVUlVcnc9PQ==

"The news media has an integrity problem. What you have to realize that there used to be a fairly clear distinction between the news desk part of media and op-ed part of media.

While in theory there is still that separation, it's pretty glaringly obvious that the op-ed side of things is in the driver's seat when it comes to news media these days. And sadly, consumers eat up that shit.

The other issue is that the FCC abandoned its fairness doctrine in the mid 80's, which essentially legally required news media outlets to present both sides on any issues deemed politically controversial.

"I'm surprised a post calling out the media's role in the current political climate was allowed to be posted here, but I'm glad it was. 

**Short answer:** Yes. 

**Long answer:**

The emotionally charged polarisation in US political discourse is precisely because the actual policy difference between the two main parties is so narrow. 

Instead of the media calling politicians out on this, the help foster this environment. Fox news is notorious for it, but even prior to Russia-gate fever pitch hysteria (6yrs worth) mainstream US news outlets had zero credibility outside of the US. 

They are all known for being mouth pieces for the establishment narratives, not questioning or information presented to them, they were even leading the charge *against* Wikileaks & Assange when he was exposing US govt war crimes.

"Tariffs almost always increase the costs of goods as they are a barrier of entry to the market that is passed onto the consumer. Tariffs sometimes can be used for companies to bring production inside the Tarriff border and costs may reduce if it can be done efficiently, but instead usually results in reduced competition and thus higher prices.

Tax cuts do reduce the overall cost of doing business and can indirectly affect the price of goods, but tax cuts are directly inflationary by increasing the amount of money available to spend, and thus the demand for goods. More entities competing for a good raises prices due to the inherent scarcity of the good.

"We can look back to every election since 1980:

|Year|Winner|Loser|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1980|Reagan|Carter|
|1984|Reagan|Mondale|

|1992|Bill Clinton|Bush Sr.|

What are the similarities between all the winners and losers here? I would argue in every single one of these 11 elections, the candidate that the average American would rather get a beer with and told funnier jokes won the election. A commonality between many of the losers is that they were viewed as stiff, too much of a policy work, or otherwise unrelatable (major offenders here include Dukakis, Gore, Kerry, Romney, & Hillary). 

With this thesis in mind, I think that Trump probably beats Biden in 2024. While Biden beat Trump in a close election in 2020, his cognitive decline has reduced a great deal of his charisma and people’s desire to get a beer with.

Attempted murder is a very serious charge and by no means is “funny” in the slightest.  You are leaving out critical facts to then mock this out of ignorance.  The would-be assassin didn’t go through all that premeditation and travel from west to east coast to then give up on a whim.  He was already discovered by authorities and was about to be arrested with a suitcase full of implements of murder before calling 911:

>According to the affidavit filed in support of the criminal complaint, on June 8, 2022, at approximately 1:05 a.m., two United States Deputy Marshals saw an individual dressed in black clothing and carrying a backpack and a suitcase, get out of a taxicab that had stopped in front of the residence of a current Justice of the United States Supreme Court.  The individual looked at the two Deputy U.S. Marshals, who were standing next to their parked vehicle, and then turned to walk down the street.

>Shortly thereafter, Montgomery County Emergency Communications Center received a call from Nicholas John Roske, who allegedly informed the call taker that he was having suicidal thoughts and had a firearm in his suitcase.

"Obviously we won’t know how far the ruling can be pushed until it gets to that and I’m not thrilled because that’s something the SC is supposed to consider in their rulings, but the one thing I take solace in is what Roberts had to say in his opinion: “Certain allegations — such as those involving Trump’s discussions with the Acting Attorney General — are readily categorized in light of the nature of the President’s official relationship to the office held by that individual. Other allegations — such as those involving Trump’s interactions with the Vice President, state officials, and certain private parties, and his comments to the general public — present more difficult questions.” That sounds like a pleasant way to say “you’ve got an uphill battle” from a judge to me. Claiming something doesn’t mean it will stick. If I’m one of his lawyers, I’m advising him not to push it and when he does anyway not to push it too far.

History proves time and again that both have the opposite affect. Increasing tariffs causes those countries to increase prices on goods where businesses pay more and then charge consumers more to make up the difference. Lowering taxes removes the incentive to keep prices low because that means those who control goods and services can now make more in the process.,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnZC16QkRIYWxmZmZmQVN4LThEaklMRGg1MTM1dTZzaDVMcGs2aHI0c3B1d2RUc1I5MVdnYm9LbVlDUzZqZkRzUVJPTlFVaG82bTJQalloejMxWno0VGc9PQ==

"I'm 19, so everything ik about the Obama administration and prior is due to Wikipedia and YouTube, along with paying attention in APUSH

I've seen the videos of everyone in Times Square celebrating the death of Osama Bin Laden. the country wasn't divided at that point in time because we had a common enemy. and in that sense, we can look to history from 1900 to see what the common enemy is

1900-1912- Big Corporations 

1912-1920- Foreign nations, revamp of Isolationism directly as a result of WW1

1920-1929- Prohibitionists

1929-1939- Herbert Hoover, Big Banking, Corporations

Notice how to this point the common man had domestic enemies, mainly the affluent classes that they could achieve but didn't want to take the risks. 

1939- 1945- WW2 Axis powers

This signifies a shift in the US, from a mostly Isolationist nation to a Globalist nation. 

1949-1989- USSR

Communism was generally the enemy. however, starting in 1960, domestically that period of time was turbulent. Consisting of violent protests to the Vietnam Draft (and a more violent response in the Kent State Massacre), political and activist assassinations didn't result in civil war due to ""threat of communism."" Reagan was very popular and wanted to get rid of communism, and for that he was largely successful and politics was stable...

2008- Economy crashes. the Bush administration quickly goes from ""good"" to ""bad"". Republicans lose credibility for the most part at the presidential level, and as a result, Obama gets elected on a platform easily described as the ""modern New Deal."" ACA is passed, more measures to help all aspects of the economy are passed, and the good times are rolling. Politics is still stable...

2016- Trump happened. Old guard Republicans are hoping they can reign him in. They can't, and the country is divided...

2020- Covid happens. This nation falls into restlessness and rioting for the summer immediately before an election. Trumps handling of the situation at hand is a dumpster fire, and Biden is elected. Everything is fine... NOT

2024- We The People are tired and fed up at the clown show that politics has become because of 2016. We The People hoped Trump would fade away into his own echo chamber. We The People assumed Biden would be a one term president... oh how wrong We were. and now We The People are at the mercy of extremists on both sides. We lost a common enemy, so We have become our own enemy.

The loonies are left and right. I think the left is more subtle but I feel for you if you can’t see how much propaganda is fed to democrats by left of center and liberal outlets. 
I’m saying this as a registered democrat who resides and votes in California. I do identify as a centrist and I think it’s a lot easier to see propaganda not targeted at your own beliefs - I think independents/centrists are generally able to spot propaganda on both sides for this reason. 
I’ll give you an example. 

There’s a belief shared among democrats here that republicans can’t be reasoned with or negotiated with. 

Many of the folks I’ve met who claim this don’t know any republicans and haven’t tried to engage any republicans outside of that online forums. So we have people making claims like this without having tried to- where did those ideas come from? I’ve seen these opinions shared in articles, television, and message boards. But they’re not independent thoughts.

If you Tariff EVERYTHING coming into america, then American companies that try to make cars for example in other parts of the world then transport them because its cheaper will take a hit, so they will make stuff in America to save money.

"Yes but this is just what America has historically done to minority groups. Within living memory you have had apartheid and segregation against non-whites and in the 80s Reagen quite literally let people from the gay community die on purpose of aids, these are things that had pretty broad cross party support. Structural racism is embedded into the country and the political class has recently been engaging in mass dehumanisation of Muslims to support its actions in the middle east, again, with cross party support.

This is all symptomatic of how authoritarian and anti democratic both parties are and always have been. In fact, if you had a proper voting system for the presidency and not the electoral college you probably wouldn't even have to worry about project 2025 as republicans rarely win the popular vote (even Hilary won). Most notably, Wade Vs Roe was repealed under a Biden administration that did pretty much nothing to stop it- he could've worked to codify abortion rights in the Obama years or reformed the supreme court to be more democratic.The things that are scary about a Trump administration like the racism, Christian nationalism and direct oppression and dehumanisation of minority groups and the poor are not things ideologically opposed by those in the democrat party because they have been proven to also engage in these behaviours when they feel like it and they don't ever make a decent attempt at removing these values from society.

If there was a true and sincere difference between these two parties you would see the democrats defending freedom of religion and making politics more secular with democratic reform to reflect that, you certainly would not see them engaging in dehumanisation of Muslims, which is itself an extension of a Christian white nationalist world view.

There is far more that unites these parties than divides them and though the republicans are presenting white Christian nationalism as a policy platform, the system of values underpinning that school of thought is not opposed by the democrats which makes them a very poor opposition to it. Trump may be a fascist but Biden is not an anti fascist and the democratic party places itself closer to the policy platform of the republican party than it does to a theoretical ""opposite"" republican party would.

Just look at political donations, many of which are split between both parties by vested interests. Both parties are absolutely committed to an anti-democratic system of governance where policy is made for and by the rich and they do much more to unite on this than they do to divide themselves on cultural issues even with project 2025. While saying they are both the same is a bit reductive of me, the underpinning ideology of both parties is authoritarian and does not care for the plights of minority groups, the LGBTQ community, the poor and women. You do not have a left and right wing party you have a far right party in the democrats and an even further right wing party in the republicans but they both support the same economic model and have anti-democratic ideals at the heart of their party.",r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNneV9OY3VRTy1Rb191M2xVVFlJbHJ2eDNjUmNoQy1FYXM0TWhoUzRDMUhrTVZhbG1uQk1VaEIyZWJVbTZOWnRNTlJGMVFubVFFNERjM0tveUJRVEFySUFVUUk1SDRESEd1YThCeHptTmxrYlE9

"Trump announced he was running after gaining steam in 2015 by proposing a really strong economic policy to bolster the middle class.

Kidding. It was after he claimed Obama was born in Kenya and then made a big deal about him proving he wasn’t. Also right around the time he mocked that disabled reporter, called McCain a loser for being shot down in the war, and claimed any news story he didn’t like was “fake news not to be trusted.”

Then he parlayed that into a campaign built on Mexico paying for a border wall and Hillary Clinton being thrown in jail.

And your takeaway is the media didn’t give him a fair chance? Trump used the media to get exactly what he wanted, and he’s spent the last 8 years driving a wedge between us as a result of his batshit and chaotic rhetoric that did not exist in modern day US politics prior to him.

"You are so wrong. American inflation is simply the swings and whims of the Federal Reserve. Which Trump has been threatened to remove of its independence. During Trump s term he criticized the Fed ALL the time. And literally bullied them into low rates. That s how inflation was under control.

Plus energy policies that favored all of the above. And sucking up to Putin and MBS kept the OPEC gas production in line. Which compared to Biden favoring green energy and denouncing these 2 dictatorships has resulted in gas production cuts and higher gas prices. Which means higher everything.

Now what Trump is responsible for the inflation is printing a fuck ton of money during the covid pandemic which Biden continued anyway. Inflation is still high because of the increase of M2 supply.

On a smaller scale, the trade war with China also had a cost on prices but Biden isn't backing down on tariffs either. So this is a moot point.

In summary, Trump will control the inflation rate. The cost is debatable. Should we keep bending the knee to such countries as Saudi Arabia and Russia just so that we can make our money last longer? Well that's up to you.

"> SCOTUS will reinterpret the 22nd amendment to mean a president has the right to run a third time.

> Trump will also get to put 2 more on the bench in another term. That's how.

 It would take an extremely generous reading of the 22nd to allow him to run for a third term unless he as a VP had succeeded into the position after the halfway point of another president's term.  But by that point, he'll be 82 and likely of deteriorating health (especially with his diet).  It's just more fear mongering otherwise.

> Kinda like how they all said under oath no president is above the law and roe was settled law at their confirmation hearings.

Already covered in another reply.

It doesn't matter if he would've or not.  The VP's role in certifying election results is ceremonial.",r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnVGhFWXF3bVdPOFo0MmlWNnRhZE5tcUNDb3d3N0NvUkRhcnFkQm1ha0IyUWJYR1lXWDNsM3NQd2dCaFBVRzBmRVJ3LWR4ZzFJdEY3WDR2bTdEbThZQUE9PQ==

"> Especially if Trump runs a smarter race, which he has so far

I'm inclined to think you haven't heard any of his messaging. The one smart thing he's done is change the party platform on abortion. That's it. Everything else he has been saying has been completely unhinged, even compared to what he was saying in the 2016 and 2020 campaign. He's gone from building the wall, to forcibly deporting millions of people. He's talking about prosecuting political opponents, and even locking up people who work for him in his previous administration. We've just been too distracted with Biden's implosion to really register it. The only thing Trump has actually done well is to consolidate Republican voters, to "" have them come home,"" earlier than they usually do. Democrats have yet to do the same with Biden. 

If and when Trump's actual rallies start getting any attention from the larger voter base, it will blunt his impact. Arguably, it already has: even as he pulls ahead of Biden, he rarely breaks 50%. This is still a winnable race. Though, as many have argued, it might be more winnable if there is anyone else at the top of the Democratic ticket. One could imagine that if Kamala was at the debate, instead of the Joe Biden we saw, Trump would have been held to better account, and there would be a stronger emphasis on the utter nonsense he was spouting that night, rather than the garbling of Biden losing track of what he was saying mid sentence.",r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnU3BhR09oekpaaGNsUVB6Nmswb24waG1uTXc2ZTVyc1R0NWxzS3Y0dXpsTjhlU1F5OGltSG9LRFc4Uk9qLURpRURTVjRUb1pQV3RMU0lOR2lpYTRWSGc9PQ==
"I really hate to say this, considering how much I disagree with the republican party platform, which is safe to say 100%, but damn it they're good at politicking and optics in comparison to the Dems. They never miss an opportunity to mobilize their supporters. They never miss a chance to just do what it takes to come out ahead, even with abhorrent policy goals. If the Dems just had the political know how even close to the Republicans, let alone equal to the Republicans, they'd be solidly in winning chances against Republican candidates. Dems keep showing time and time again they need to get it together, especially winning amongst the independents and politically undecided/apathetic, because winning over those groups, particularly in swing states, are what ultimately makes or breaks a candidates chances.",r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnSmdVaWp2dzJ0RFFibVJDbU96cy1kRnQxOURuUDYwZHVCTDA2bHdoS0t3dEdJd1J5bF9nWU5Qd3ZnbzFONGNBU3pCYjE0RWViYzZsRGJ5SUd4bmkyVEhvRk8wRjZWNDk5ZUg0QzBrRHYtRE09

"I would absolutely say it's both sides. Trumps rhetoric has been very inflammatory, especially his run in 2016. In 2020 and 2024 it has toned down although still inflammatory. But if you listen to adverts approved by Biden's campaigns and what Biden has said they are equally strong and inflammatory. Now of course if you believe what Biden is saying is true then you will believe what he is saying is justified. Which is the same for Trump's supporters.

And that is the crux of the problem. Biden voters believe that Trump is a fascist, they don't want to be police to fascists for the sake of being polite. Trump voters believe there are violent criminals coming across the border, they don't want to downplay it for the sake of being polite.
