"Not necessarily a critique here, but just wanted to point out that in the primaries it is mostly the republicans and the (possibly compromised) republican party voting for their candidate, so Trump winning against his challengers just means an intensification of % support for him within the party (though his % of ""winning"" votes is much lower with Haley thrown in), but does not mean the numbers of general election voters are for him.

">if we can’t successfully run free health care for veterans (pop. of roughly 30 million) what makes you think we can successfully have free healthcare for 340 million people?

Just about every other industrialized nation on this planet has managed to figure it out. The difference here in the U.S. is that we have one party (republicans) whose entire platform is to underfund and undermine any attempt to provide adequate services for the American people, and another party (Democrats) that allows that to happen so they have something to campaign on.

>i don’t want my money going towards someone else’s health bills. that’s my hard earned money. i deserve it, no one else.

This happens regardless. When you pay for private health insurance, that money doesn't go into a vault specially for use by you. It's used to cover everyone else's health care coverage. The smoker's cancer treatment. The obese person's heart surgery. The trans person's hormones. What's worse is that you are also paying for CEO bonuses, yachts, stock buybacks, and billion dollar marketing campaigns. And you prefer that.

>i don’t need to broadcast my heterosexuality to people

This sentence sums up the problem with everything you said earlier in that paragraph. You've never been targeted for harassment or marginalized because of your sexual preference. Trans people, gay people are celebrated because they have historically been oppressed and victimized because of their sexual preferences. They didn't want it to be anyone else's business. They did just want to exist the same as everyone else. But there's a group of people in this country that have made that very, very difficult. Now you get to have pride month. The enhanced visibility of these groups are meant to end the shame that has been forced upon them for centuries.

>the local middle school i attended had 2 teachers (also my teachers about 12 years ago) started a SECRET LGBTQ+ club on campus and told students not to notify parents of it

This is a good thing, and has been a thing since the 80's, at least. It's meant as a way to have a place for LGBT youth to have a safe place to socialize with others instead of their bigoted parents drive them to suicide. If you think same-sex attraction doesn't start happening in middle school, I've got some news for you.

>gay marriage will not be criminalized nor do i think it should be

That's great. There are conservatives in power that disagree with you. Even Obama and Biden in the early 2000s disagreed with you there. Remember, we're talking about the far right.

>the whole questioning your sexual identity should not be discussed by teacher and student. that is a conversation to be had at home.

If you're fortunate enough to have a home where these things are allowed to be discussed, sure. I don't think any kid should be made to question their sexual identity by a teacher, but a sex ed teacher should be allowed to tell their students that if they are attracted to the same sex, that they have absolutely no reason to feel a sense of shame or guilt for that. That alone will save lives.

>not one person have i met that is conservative wants to eradicate trans people, ban same sex marriage, or kidnap immigrants

"If you think trump was good for the economy then here’s a little history and economics for you. First off yes we had a great economy prior to Covid, what economists call a sugar high economy, what do I mean? 

 Take the historically low interest rates for example. Yes they were good short term. Buying new homes and selling went up fast. People sold, refinanced, or bought new homes to capitalize on the low interest rates. This increased demand certainly caused housing prices to start going up, and in the long run was only going to cause prices to skyrocket as demand diminished. The biggest cause is that more people than ever could afford a home because of the low interest. In reality there is not enough housing and supply cannot meet demand, causing inflated prices. 

The other reality is the trade war, which may be good for the US in the long run once we reestablish our supply lines and manufacturing capacity. But in the short term the cost of goods we rely on and are completely dependent on from china immediately goes up drastically. The cost of Tariffs placed on Chinese imports is passed on to you the customer. The trade war also escalated during Covid, causing major problems and supply chain issues, again causing inflation. 

Trump handled Covid as bad as anyone could imagine. During Covid the middle class in America lost something like 16 trillion dollars. Trump signed those executive orders which allowed for the greatest violation of our rights in history. Businesses shut down without due process of law. Small businesses killed, told by trump’s government, “you are not essential” you cannot operate safely, you must die and only buy from your monopoly china supplied competition. 

 Another fact to consider with high fuel prices is that this year the  (EIA) forecasts that crude oil production in the United States will average 12.8 million barrels per day (b/d) in 2024, surpassing the previous record of 12.3 million b/d set in 2019.  We are producing more oil than at any other time and prices are high. Why? 

The US has a globalized economy which is affected by world events and not everything is in our control. Since the Ukraine war, oil imports were cut. For example in 2021, the US imported an average of 209,000 barrels per day of crude oil and 500,000 bpd of other petroleum products from Russia. Russias invasion was a red line of fuel price increases. 

Another factor is OPEC which has a monopoly on oil. OPEC members control almost 82% of the world’s proven oil supplies.
OPEC accounts for nearly 40% of the world’s total crude oil production. OPEC cuts oil production to drive up prices, especially when they don’t like the American president. OPEC member Saudi Arabia actually owns the largest oil refinery in the US in Texas, and during political campaigns has shut it down for “maintenance” driving up prices. 

 To put gas prices into perspective the US imported 3 billion barrels of crude oil and petroleum products in 2021, which is 43% of the country’s consumption. So as you can see, global oil supply and prices heavily affect the cost of fuel today even while we produce record amounts of oil. In fact the US is still importing vast sums of oil from Russia through countries like India. 

 So as you can see things are tough for everyone and the effects are not “Biden’s fault” 

 Saudi Arabia announced an additional 1 million barrels per day cut in crude oil production, while OPEC+ extended its production cuts through 2024. This is to squeeze the US and influence our democracy and the election. Trump approved arms sales to Saudi Arabia that were banned by congress, and trumps family made fortunes from deals with foreign governments while trump was in office including Saudi Arabia. 

It’s easy to point the finger and blame Biden but in reality, why would the sitting president want prices to be high and the effects and harms this would inevitably cause politically? 

President Biden released a total of 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) on November 23, 2021, to lower prices for Americans and address the mismatch between demand exiting the pandemic and supply.

Additionally, on October 25, 2022, President Biden announced the release of 15 million barrels of oil from the U.S. strategic reserve.

It’s worth noting that the Biden administration also sold off more than 40 percent of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help limit rising fuel prices after Russia invaded Ukraine.",r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYOXIzZUdFWHo4c19aR3B3b1hWelRMNXV4cVJNVHJWbE4tc1FtZjR1VnI3Y2NJS3c0S0ZHN2hEdmI4V3dfVVFOU19NcXJweE9pNUhhcThDaTlrWWNEalE9PQ==
"Also corporations are using various tactics to increase prices, including:

Dynamic pricing. Companies are using advanced data collection and algorithms to charge customers different prices based on their individual characteristics, such as location, purchase history, and behavior.

Price fixing. Corporations are colluding to reduce oil production and increase prices for Americans at the pump.

 Profiteering. Companies are enjoying profit increases even as they pass on costs to customers, many of whom are struggling to afford basic necessities. Corporations are using the guise of disruptions to raise prices beyond what their costs would suggest is necessary or what economic theory would suggest is prudent, squeezing higher profits out of cash-strapped customers.

 A significant portion of the American economy is controlled by a handful of companies that face little competition today. They use their monopolies to artificially manipulate the markets and milk the population for every penny. While we’re all struggling they are recording record profits. Guess what, trump loved giving those corporations tax cuts and subsidizing them with your tax dollars even though they are out of control and raping the nation.",r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYaGVfbHdJRWdnZVVJOVJ5VWhiZ2hYZTdqdHZxb3NwOUhzM25hdjJMV2ZPR2pzRl9CSG9HRzJ3UVlXaGc5aFdERmI2aHZZTUhzTVFUMWR3ZXRyd2RsZkE9PQ==
"Esperanto?  I think there are far more useful things you could spend your time learning. 

The president does not have a dial on gas prices. We are producing more oil now than at any time in history. But taking Russian oil off the legal market is the major driver of oil price right now. 

The inflation was a result of a bungled response to the pandemic and too many giveaways to stave off a depression-but likely you enjoyed those payments yes?  After most of the supply chain issues sorted out what is left is just corporate greed. You think Trump will go after his buddies over you?

Honey…you know they hate the “theys” the most right?

> So when Biden was president looking for jobs was hard, they would kick me out from jobs no matter what, I live in Florida lots of immigrants and all they want here are working people from other countries than a high school diploma and college student who knows both Spanish and English and I’m learning Esperanto and nothing they push me away like nothing I’ve been without a job for 2 years and now I work as an Uber eats driver earning low.

Okay. Here’s some tough love: you need to work on your writing. I don’t know what your circumstances are but I had trouble understanding what you were trying to say here.  Many of the jobs that you might be interested in are going to require written communication skills. This includes decent paying jobs that don’t require a college degree.

Let’s also put this in perspective, according to your profile you are 20. I remember being 20. God I was both insufferable and an idiot. I’m willing to be the same is true for you. Not super pertinent, but I just want to level with you and say I’ve been there, but it’s worth keeping in mind that you do not know everything. 

But, if this is true, the last time Trump was in office, you were still in high school. Now, there are of course teens who work, but I presume you were still mostly doing school stuff. Now, you sound like you aren’t doing college or any other training so you are just working. Well…what you are running into is just being a grown ass adult. If you were not in the working world before, how can you really say it was better under Trump? 

Lastly, Esperanto is a party trick. I’m not saying not to learn it, but don’t expect that it’s going to open up doors for you professionally.

> The economy here is trash even my family is having trouble to pay things and it’s expensive, gas prices are too high and a 1$ candy will cost you 1.25$, I’ve seen lots and lots of poor people asking for money I can’t even keep a dollar because of them. 

I’m guessing you live with your parents or family(?) I get that these are easy ways to measure how things are going, but I think you need to understand a few things about Florida before ultimately coming down on the side of “this is all Joe Biden‘s fault“. I will get into these in the next section, but I think you need to make sure the things you want to blame Joe Biden for are actually his fault.

> I’m fighting with my family to earn good money and considering im a citizen we don’t get enough and we don’t get any help. 

I’m curious what kind of help you are looking for? Money? Social services? I hate to tell you, but most of our social safety net programs are run and administered by the states. Each state gets to choose a lot about who is eligible, what benefits you receive, and how these programs work. Yes, federal funding, and support is important and there are some aspects which are controlled or regulated by the federal government, but a lot of what you actually experience is something that you’re going to need to take up with the state of Florida and Ron DeSantis. 

You should know that Florida is one of 10 states that still has not expand Medicaid under the ACA. Essentially, the federal government, under this law, offers money to states to expand these programs to help more people qualify for Medicaid. But in part because of how difficult Republicans made this, it had to be enacted on a state by state basis, and some states still refuse the money. Florida is one of them. I don’t know if you or your family would qualify, but I can guarantee it would help some people for sure.

Next, one of the things that’s really killing Florida is the rising cost of housing. Florida is of course a state which has a variety of challenges. But Florida’s estate has not really been very proactive about trying to get ahead of problems and make sure that they are investing in the future. We could talk about climate change, but I think in terms of things like how they’ve regulated or failed to regulate the insurance market is huge example. This is one of the big reasons why Florida is becoming so expensive, because housing prices are not only going through the roof due to high demand for housing, but you also have things which now can’t be insured or cost an astronomical amount to insure. 

Lastly, as it comes to immigrants and jobs, I do hope you will remember that [Florida Republicans had to beg for migrant farm workers to stay after some of the legislation they passed](https://www.businessinsider.com/florida-gop-lawmaker-urges-immigrants-stay-voted-anti-immigration-bill-2023-6?amp). Don’t get mad at the people who come here to work, get mad at the people who hire them, many of whom are Republican donors who benefit from riling people up and from cheap exploitable labor. Anyway, immigrants disappearing from our society, simply would not help you and your family, because they are so foundational to how our system runs that even if you had a job, it may not be a job that you really want and many things would be way more expensive due to a lack of people to fill those jobs and, the higher wages that would need to be paid in order to attract and retain workers. 

Here’s the thing: Republicans don’t really care if you were citizen or not, they don’t really think it’s their job to help. They think you need to sink or swim no matter how rough the waters are. Yes, project 2025 is bad when it comes to LGBTQ issues, but if you think that it’s going to help you and your family‘s financial situation and also provide anything like a social safety net, then you are sorely mistaken.

"> So that’s why I’m voting for trump so he can save me from the financial crisis I’m going through, I don’t care if my rights are gone my body makes the choices but being poor and living on the streets is my greatest fear.

Again, 20 and dumb. I’ll be honest, your vote matters 0% in Florida. Florida will go to Trump. But, as a symbolic gesture, I would still encourage you not to vote for him.

I really want to ask yourself, just on a basic big picture level: what exactly does Trump plan to do fix your specific problems? Like, what basic things is he actually going to do to accomplish his stated goals? I’m sure that you’ve heard all kinds of constructed arguments from the people around you about how Trump will make things better, but really can you actually explain to us how that works? Can you explain to yourself how that works or are you just taking his word for it? And do you think we should run a country on “just trust me bro“?

Yes, Joe Biden, and Democrats are not perfect. I have plenty of criticisms of them myself. But that being said, I do think that Democrats try and are sincere about their beliefs. And as much shit as we tend to give them, Democrats do a lot of good things. It would be great to have a second party that is reasonable, and which operates in good faith, but that is not currently the Republican party.

> So yeah I wanted to know if anyone had the same experience or are voting for trump and are from the lgbt community?

So, look, I get it: you feel trapped and are willing to try basically anything to see change happen. But this is almost certainly something you will regret especially as a queer person. The reality is that most queer people who are Republicans tend to be very rich and are simply looking for a tax cut and think that their money and power will buy them protection from whatever affects Republicans might have in store. But that’s not going to apply to you. Also, I would just note that a lot of people who fall into this camp are people who tend to have a lot of unresolved issues and a harbor quite a lot of self hatred . Dave Rubin is a perfect example of this.

Again, having also been A young gay with a big ego and sense of self importance and a flair for the dramatic, I get that you want to differentiate yourself. But you do need to be aware that this instinct can lead you to make bad decisions. It takes honesty and effort to reflect on why you were doing things and whether or not your initial intuition is even correct. Like I mentioned, it’s probably the case that your vote for president isn’t going to matter much, but I do hope you’ll think about some of the issues that Republicans create for not only your state, but the entire country.

Lastly, I do think that you need to understand what this means for your dating prospects moving forward. There will be a good number of women and certainly many gay men who simply will refuse to associate with you. And maybe you’re OK with that in theory, I’m not sure you are prepared in practice.",r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYX1BZUWJCTDZBLUFCMXI1eVA4MnhnNnRqZFFwMzdweEkwVkFMdkxCRUF5bkxYdGw5bjczS3NPOEVhTGF4aE80Ym02SG9jcUpjemRKVlJyUDZQanpVU0xiYm9Xb3V1REFVd3MtZ2E0OVNZYm89

"I’ve got two immediate problems with your opinion.  

The first is that you - like many others I’ve seen - are still characterizing the focus on Biden as being part of some media narrative. As someone who was already concerned about him, watching that debate performance and how he’s responded to it has been a jarring experience. Not jarring, as in - “I can’t vote for him over Trump now” (of course I still *can*). Jarring, as in - “Holy **** were going to lose the election”.  

It’s not the media who time and time again comes to sow division within the ranks about *the guy*. It’s “vote blue no matter who” voters, the ones who start shouting it before we even reach the general election, that cause the problem. What is it exactly that you’re asking of the media? - that they simply gloss over that the sitting President appears to be suffering from cognitive decline? Just admit that you **don’t** want them to report on what they’re seeing. You want them to be Team Biden.  

The second issue I have is this - the candidate you’re hanging onto **isn’t winning**. You’re asking the media and the online community to be quiet - but to protect what, exactly? He’s been losing in the polls since even before this fiasco. And now we’re supposed to ignore the fiasco so that he can win? How does that make sense?  

You’re asking people to be quiet so we can win. I’m asking people to get louder about him so we can win. We both want Democrats (this year, at least - I know you’re an independent) to win, but I don’t understand why you think protecting President Biden is the path to that.

"Um, no. That's not what I was saying at all.

But first, yes, the media has been all in against Biden since the Afghanistan pull out, which was the end of the ""Honeymoon"". The constant reposting of the pics of a helicopter, reminiscent of the fall of Saigon in Viet Nam, and saying this is ""just like Viet Nam"", was editorializing, not reporting, and not the reality. And I still remember them saying, with utter assurance, how there was no way we'd be able to get X number of people out, then it happened, then not x number of people out, then it happened, then not x number of people out, and then not only did it happen, but it was the largest evacuation of a country in history, and ... crickets. No acknowledgement they were wrong. All of them. Onto the next scare: Gas prices out of control. Next scare: We're heading for a recession. Next scare (which was true but not really in Biden's control): Inflation. And always, always in the background, dating from years ago: Biden is too old, he's senile, he's about to die. Always. This has been ongoing. They have been highlighting every gaffe and misstep, omitting or light-touching good news when it comes. By contrast, ignoring heavily Trump's ... everything rotten about Trump, but treating him like he was always the presumptive nominee, like a rapist, an indicted and now convicted felon, a man who abused his presidential power and tried to overturn an election, is a normal choice for a candidate. As if everything is equal. This is not the media playing for democracy or the truth. This is the media doing what it always does, gin things up so they get clicks from all sides, the horse race, the moolah, the ...

Well, now we're back to how I was saying what you are saying about what I was saying is not what I was saying. At all. I don't want the media to be Team Biden. I want them to report accurately, not constantly put on he said/she said pundits and ""we'll have to leave it there"" ""both sides do it"" journalism. I hate Trump, obviously, but that doesn't mean they have to be mean to him. It's just if they are reporting constantly about Biden's mixing up names, why is there absolutely no coverage of Trump doing that ... and he is doing that constantly. If they are going to report about a debate or a press conference, instead of focusing solely on how one person ""performed"", they report on the accuracy of the entire facts (not just name flubs), and in the case of politicians, what exactly their policies are. Biden's age and his performance might be unpopular. Talking about Hannibal Lector and Sharks and Electric Boats ad nauseum is not a kitchen sink issue to anyone; and ending Roe, spurning American Allies and talking up dictators, planning to subvert democracy, is NOT popular. But all that is passed over by the MSM. But more about Biden mixing up names, please. One last thing about that, when Trump was president, even on NPR when something bad would happen, there would be a lilting uplifting appraisal and how that was just going to be a glitch, and ""it could be a good sign"" ... including Covid. When Biden became president, every little last thing, was harped on. Gas prices go up? Literally, verbatim: ""You've all seen the gas prices! They're going up again!"" Gas prices go down ... either crickets or ""but that could be a bad sign"". You telling me the media hasn't been harder on Biden is going to fall on deaf ears here. You are not telling the truth. And also, I am only asking for a level playing field, not what you said, for them to be Team Biden.

And now, the greater point: I am not telling anyone not to talk about Biden, or to not talk about him poorly. I don't want people to be quiet about him or whatever. I also want people to get louder. What I am talking about is people (the people at the top and redditors I guess), just throwing in the towel after a bad ""performance"" at a debate, demanding he step down or aside for someone else. Especially when they claim it is because ""independents won't vote for him"". They, and you, are wrong. If they, those dem leaders and pundits, can see how he performs at a debate, no matter how ""scary"", and go ""wow, that was a bad debate"" and ""is he okay?"", then that is, logically, what they should do. Acknowledge the truth, but don't go flying into fits of unrestrained hysteria. If the man feels he can do a good job, and those in his administration feel he can continue to do a good job, then whatever any top democrat or George Clooney feel about how he needs to get out because ""it doesn't look good"" and ""he isn't electable"" (as if they know), can fuck the fuck off. That is pure opinion and trepidatious gazing into a crystal ball. Not reality. It is fear. You say he's polling poorly. Hey, guess who polled poorly in the last number of elections? democrats. And yet they have performed very well. Dems, we all, need to get behind the guy with a great record, a great plan going forward, has the chops for doing the chief executive job (if not the spry stage performer), and feels he can keep doing the job. If he stepped aside, on his own volition, I wouldn't bat an eye to support whoever is there. But democrats and celebrities lining up to bash on him, to get their faces on the camera, is doing nobody any good, and they could be using their power to say, yeah, the guy had a bad night, he's older, but he can still function in the role he has been doing for the past three years and is campaigning for, and he's vastly better than what is being offered on the other side. Right now we are not talking about the achievements of his administration, which have been landing recently, which would propel any other candidate, but whether he mixed up someone's name (despite everything else in the speech being ""fine"" and logical and accurate) and how that makes him unfit for office.

For this election, I am blue no matter who. But what the elites in the party are projecting is, it's blue no matter who, but if Biden is in he's going to lose because he's totally out of it. That's not projecting positives or strength, that is projecting weakness and it is simply not the truth. That is their fear.

"Listen - if I mischaracterized your point, I apologize. It was a huge post with lots of details - I won’t claim that I didn’t miss specific nuance that changes the character of your point.  

That being said, I think we still disagree on the broad strokes. I think you’ll acknowledge that arguing over media treatment is a black hole, because so much of this comes down to who you’re watching. There is so much media - even just on the major networks. So your experience of what the media has been doing could be quite different from mine. I’m still of the opinion that that the media has not been anti-Biden, as a whole. And I don’t know what people mean when they say Trump hasn’t been getting the negative attention he deserves. Coverage of his civil trials and criminal trials have been all over the news for quite some time. Eye-popping headlines about how many lies he told in (insert any Trump public speech) have been published by almost all news sources but the most right leaning (like FOX). For years. And that’s the despite the fact that he really **shouldn’t** be getting as much coverage and scrutiny - he’s not the sitting president. Biden is. Again - it’s a difficult point to argue because it depends on what you’re listening to.  

I just don’t agree with your philosophy on how to handle President Biden’s current situation. And I think it’s coming down to the fact that you just don’t think his current situation is a big deal. You say you don’t want people to be quiet, and you don’t want the media to be on Biden’s team, but you characterize much of what’s being said right now negatively. You think much of it is hysteria, because you don’t think his current state is a big problem. If you did, you wouldn’t think it’s hysteria.  

As far as your point on the polling - I don’t think the polls should be disregarded because there are instances of them being wrong. In fact - haven’t they been wrong in Trump’s favor the past two presidential elections? Hillary was up - lost. Biden was up pretty significantly in 2020 (if I recall correctly) and it ended up being a nail biter. How does that bode for us when we’re actually down this time?  

Anyway - I apologize again for any mischaracterization.",r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYTmZiUmtjZ3JHbnBMaWQ4TVpTY3lxWnIyTFI0MzRvd3RPRHFTWHBsbVJ2R1hfdW1TS2hsREo1aDY4NVFGNFo4V2szdTRHb2dLMHZQZmgxaTJ6cW1md2phNGZhY2cwWVItMVQ1QkVkeDV6cVE9
"No prob. Yeah, I tend to write a lot. It does look like we are differing on our perception of him. Also, maybe the perception of the job: I very much feel this modern-day change to the presidency, that the president also has to perform for the audience, is a terrible addition. It does not accurately reflect what the actual job is, just one side aspect of it. (Ironically, it was probably FDR, who hid his crippling illness, that helped bring that about with his ""fireside chats"", on top of the Kennedy-Nixon debate).

To make things short(ish), in another post I related how I have someone in my family who is older, who worked as a nurse for most of her professional life. She has always had trouble remembering names, even, and especially, those of her children. When she is bobbling for a name, she just throws in a made up name that nobody has and laughs, and we know who she's talking about by context or she points to the person. As she has gotten older, that has gotten worse. But that doesn't change the fact that she still knows about an encyclopedia's worth of medical facts (and other things), and we still turn to her for medical advice, and would trust her more in that capacity than someone in the family who can toss out people's names correctly at the drop of a hat. So that is part of my experience, and why I don't see Biden mixing up names or getting a little fumbly when speaking, which he has done for decades, as a problem, even if it is happening more often. He still know what is going on and can do the actual job. This is my opinion.

I don't know, polling is getting kind of nebulous and a little off, one way or another. People are a little more savvy right now, and for some reason, with the meaning-up of our culture, enjoy trolling and fucking with other people. So I'm not trusting the polling necessarily, and can only be moved from pessimistic to cautiously optimistic. Although, tbh, that this race is close against Trump, of all people, and not a complete blowout already, is disheartening. He is not for America. Nearly a million deaths under that callous oaf didn't prove that?",r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYMFRQTTdIYlBBZmxuejVaZ0J6UDJDbWI3UDdlRS02V1pVVGQ2Wm5ZX0dCTlhib3RmM1pQMWMteWNYSGhVVHhQU3E4WGtmVEFmLVBIVk9tTzFEUkhSX2c9PQ==
"First a minor thing. You are not an independent. You are a dedicated Democrat this year. I can't blame you for wanting to say you're an independent because the claim gives you more credibility, but it just isn't so.

I can't blame you for being a strong Biden supporter, either. Trump is worse than Biden. For that matter, Trump is worse than Reagan with Alzheimers. Looking back, Reagan wasn't that bad. I was particularly charmed when he had a private conversation with the Russian premier and agreed to nuclear disarmament. Then his handlers told him he just couldn't do that. He was sad about it. So was I. If only he'd had enough clout to do it anyway....

At this point it looks like Trump will win. Biden looks feeble. And anybody they try to replace him with at this point looks worse. All that dedicated Democrats can do is soldier on, do their best to win anyway. Or mayve put their efforts on the congressional races, senators and representatives, make sure the GOP doesn't get a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate or any majority at all in the House. Disapprove anybody Trump suggests for the Supreme Court. We can go a few years with 7 or 8 supreme court judges. Like Ajax, fight intensely while on the defensive.

The Democratic Party has dealt us a bad hand. It isn't that easy to get a candidate who can lose to Trump, but it looks like they've done it a second time.

I agree we need to keep fighting. There are plenty of good democrats out there. Outstanding ones. There are also some good republicans, but it will take them throwing off MAGA to make the party something a sane person could vote for.

I feel your pessimism but I don't agree with it at all. I still don't think Trump will win.

"Too long, didn't read. I might have had more agreement with you before that debate. It was truly frightening and for the first time I began to think that he can't do the job well enough *now*, let alone a couple of years from now. Don't get me wrong. He's been a great president. Maybe the best in my lifetime. But I have worked in the aging industry for a long time. I watched my father suffer serious mental decline. I know what I saw because I've seen it many times before. 

I'd vote for Biden on his death bed, don't get me wrong on that either. But now I'm leaning towards finding another candidate, as disruptive as that would be. Another candidate could bring the fight to Trump and drive a pointed and disciplined campaign message. I'm sorry that being good at running for president doesn't necessarily make you good at presidenting. But that is the world we live in.

Unprecedented levels of addiction / overdose and a mental health epidemic are certainly not making things easier.

I acknowledge that life in the U.S. is better than almost anywhere else at any other time, and I love the hell out of my country, but when it comes to things like civic morale - and perception becomes reality for this kind of sociological phenomenon - it's the mathematics of change and the vectors involved that matter - so going from great to good is worse than going from bad to mediocre, if that makes sense.

"Okay, well, that's your opinion. I have family members in their 90's who are sharp as a tack. I've had family members who had a hard mental declines (dementia and Alzheimers). Biden is not showing any of those things. I also have a family member who can't remember names worth shit, even her own children, and it's been that way forever, and only getting worse as she gets older, but is a fully qualified (though retired) nurse who has an encyclopedic knowledge of healthcare and can administer it and give advice like a whiz, even if she isn't the best at speaking sometimes or gets names confused. She can still do her job. This is what I see in Biden. So, I guess our experiences differ and that's where our outlooks come from.

Contested elections for an incumbent has always meant they lose, this is what the republicans have been after since he was elected. McConnell had said they needed to ""make Biden Carter"" and it has been that way ever since.

"So there's no real problem, but Democrats could *create* a problem by dithering and angsting about Biden's brain issues.

It mostly doesn't make much difference. The president has a lot of advisors who tell him what to think. For example, every day the intelligence services give him a 1-page report about the world. It will have a few sentences about various developing problem. One place terrorists are fostering public discontent and arranging for mass riots, and the USA is providided nonviolent technology for riot dispersal. Another place freedom fighters are organizing the public against an oppressive government, and China is selling them weapons that are primarily useful against their own people. Every few days the president gets a little more information about who the enemies are and what they want, and what the USA can do to oppose them. So when some sudden crisis reaches the news, the president already has the background that he absorbed with no effort.

Early in Trump's first term he announced that he wasn't going to read that report and it caused various shock waves. If it had been some other president I would have liked him not getting brainwashed that way. With Trump I didn't know what he believed already and it bothered me that he wasn't getting the background.

"I see the OP listing problems but not suggesting solutions.   I don't have any solutions either.   I see the underlying problem as a particular corner of modern technology.  

Each of us can live in an information bubble where the only facts we see are those that support our prior beliefs.  Not only ""can"" but ""is pushed to"", because algorithms see what we like and feed us more of that.

We may each have different values and different priorities, but gov't policy requires that we reach some sort of agreement.

"You ask, where do we go from here. 

We desperately need great big reforms which we cannot make happen. The legislature is deadlocked. We cannot get prosperity without some adequate alternative to oil, but at the moment our giant corporations will not create that alternative and the government can't make them. 

We had something vaguely similar in the 1930's. Rich people could get whatever they wanted cheap. It wasn't bad for them to have a lot of people out of work, and a lot of people living cheap, when they could have whatever they wanted. Lots of great big mansions were built then, with cheap lumber and cheap workmen etc. Is that where we're headed now? There's plenty of oil to keep the super-rich having whatever they want. Just not enough for the former middle class to have air conditioning and beef and things like that.

Maybe the solution is a great big conventional war, like WWII but different. Maybe, for example, we get into a war with Iran. And they damage 3 aircraft carriers, and sink 20 of their escort vessels and damage many more. Suddenly we aren't ready to fight wars all over the world. And many of our allies desert us or try to go neutral considering Russia and China. China stops exporting to us, and many nations that do export to us raise their prices so high we can't really afford it. We desperately need to refurbish our military but we depend on those imports.  We depend on imported fossil fuel. 

So we have to make great big reforms, and we have to make great big sacrifices. Food rationing, gasoline rationing, etc. Very little consumer air conditioning, limits to home heating. We wrap up in blankets, we get new recipes for our beans, etc. The legislature doesn't prevent reforms, because There Is No Alternative. TINA.

How does the war end? I don't know. It's often hard to predict before a war starts how it will end. But for the duration, all of the old obstacles that prevented us from being ready to win a real war will be out of the way. The profit motive, banking profits, environmental regulations, medical costs for civilian medical care, anything that interferes with the war effort will be pushed aside. And if the war doesn't end in defeat, we will have an economy that's capable of prosperity afterward, for the survivors who got through with minimal medical care and a limited diet etc.",r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYUDVCNnc5Wlp0VGhBc19sS0JiTUhaa1hoRU8tTndLWEp2Z2RRYnF1RGEtZGxKUmNuLWZJb3NCaDQxbTZVbHhFRER3eXJPREhDVFI5bkdhZ2l1UXMwQ0E9PQ==

"Thank you sir for your diligence, vigilance and concern for the future and freedom of the United States. You are exactly right that the republicans have turned their backs on the fundamental inherent natural rights and liberties of the American revolution and western civilization. They are coming from a place of hate politics, Christian church and state ideology, and principles antithetical to Americanism.

Republicans are attacking immigrants and desensitizing their base to immigrants, pointing the finger at immigrants, blaming immigrants like the Nazis did the Jews. Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed his intention to end birthright citizenship, which grants U.S. citizenship to children born in the country to immigrant parents. In May 2023, Trump renewed his pledge to end birthright citizenship for children of immigrants in the country illegally on his first day in office if re-elected in 2024. The constitution states “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” The republicans have waged a war on the constitution and our freedoms and this is one of many attacks on fundamental freedoms this country Embodies. In fact trump is preaching communist racial theory and Nazi hate politics when he says that immigrants are  “poisoning the blood of our country”.

You addressed clearly many of the other freedoms and principles the republican's are waging war on. I shall not address them further.

Foreign policy however is something which effects the United States of America greatly and must be addressed. Foreign policy is the area of greatest concern and consequence to the nation right now more then ever, and republicans pose a threat to the future of this nation never seen before.

Freedom is declining globally.  **Closed autocracies have increased from 25 to 30 countries globally**, with 5.4 billion people, or 70% of the world’s population, living in dictatorships.

**Nine countries have become pure dictatorships,** including Afghanistan, Chad, Guinea, Haiti, Iran, Mali, Myanmar, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.

**The number of dictatorships has surpassed the number of democracies**, with authoritarian approaches to governance becoming more prevalent.

Aggression is increasing with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Chinas threats and aggression near Taiwan and in the south china sea. Iran's attacks on Israel and aggression by other proxy terrorist groups in the region. North Korea is becoming belligerent, and is exchanging support to Russia's war, in exchange for long range missile and nuclear technology.

The good news is that America is standing strong supporting Ukraine. The United States is rebuilding Alliances and working to preserve the peace. Right now the US is winning and the prospects although challenging are bright. America needs to be strong right now more then ever. Weakness, appeasement, isolationism, will only lead to war.

I will not predict the hypotheticals of how things will go moving forward but I will say what I think the only way forward is.

First, propaganda is everywhere and must be confronted with real information, people need to learn to think and check information instead of believing what they hear. The information war must be won because right now propaganda is effectively demoralizing, polarizing and dividing our society. We need to take this seriously and launch government programs to address this challenge. Programs like ""Radio Free Europe"" ""The big Picture"" etc.

Secondly, We need to educate Americans with our actual history and the basis of our principles and their importance to humanity.

Thirdly, America must address the economic crisis in this nation. We need to confront the Monopolies and predatory crony corporatists and banksters and their influence in our politics and government. We need to address the centralization of power and wealth, and bring Equal opportunity and fairness back to our economic system. The feudalist system is perhaps our greatest weakness.

Fourth, We need to address the health crisis in America.

Fifth, we need vibrant leaders which represent the interests of the nation and the People to step up, willing to pay the price and bring integrity back to government.

"The Right is not the problem. It is the solution.

The problem is that authoritarianism isn't Right or Left but everchanging. It goes where it thinks it'll win. If we simply continue to vote left permanently, those in control of the Right will simply switch back to the Democrats. Especially as those on the Left continue to swing further left ""to oppose evil on the Right.""

On the bright side this can be, not solved, but temporarily fixed for a few decades through the one thing authoritarians hate, unity through democracy and freedom. But that involves bringing the center-left and center-right together, not pushing the Right further away. 

Leftists will need to compromise and step further Right to pull Right-Wing and Conservatives back into sanity.

Bear in mind all of these are negotiable, not all the options and don't need to be to the letter depending on the person you're reaching for:

Accept limits on abortion and LGBTQIA+ rights.

Allow Christian principles to take more prominence in the country.

Abandon ideas like reparations and CRT, especially the demand that they be mandatory.

Protect gun rights and speech rights instead of putting more limits on them.

Limit illegal immigration especially from Central America/Middle East.

Cool it with the anti-white/anti-male rhetoric

Stop encouraging crime and start promoting more nuclear families. 

There's room for concessions for the Left too but if you want to pull conservatives from the brink you have to make a genuine effort and make serious short and long-term changes to the platform, politicians and way we see the world. 

One of the best beliefs the Right have is the belief in opportunity. We still have the opportunity to make things right. It's not easy and it won't be popular to most Leftists, but the right way is not always the popular or easy way.",r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYbmhVdU41a3daNmQ0eUpwdEtRNHZrQUl0NWpsN2xvNDBNUkl0RXF0M28zOUpnTmVTUHZ6MzhlRW9jbm5nSUFJdE1jVTdlNHdJWUY3SFNHQzFKdXBjWEtNUmI4X1J1ZGNBZlhrQm40RzdKTTA9

However, and forgive me if this comes off as negative or pessimistic, but I just can’t see any of those things actually realistically happening.

The corporations that control politics and media in the US have too much to gain by keeping the general population poor, uneducated, and acting against their own best interests.

The only way I could possibly see things START to move in the right direction, is through something like an unprecedented 16+ year run of political wins for Dems, and things going well, shifting the Overton window back towards the left.

To your other point, did you hear the press conference? The guy has a pretty good grasp on what is going on, by all accounts (except people mistaking gaffes with reasoning) he is pretty astute about the international landscape. He’d be getting briefed, just like any president before, and even more in depth than Trump was, obviously. And then he can make decisions. That is what policy is for. If you are going in for deep state conspiracy, I don’t know what to tell you. If there really was a deep state, they’d find a way to bamboozle the president into what they want to be perceived.

"My god this is a bunch of blather. 

I have two questions for you respondents:
1) how old are you?
2) have you taken care of a relative over the age of 80?

Because if you haven’t you really don’t have any perspective. 

I’m 64, in reasonably good health (only HBP to deal with) and I am absolutely astonished at how much shit is breaking on me now.  I’m hoping that with a few fixes over the summer ill be fit as a fiddle, but if I extrapolate the past few months to 80 it scares the fuck out of me. 

Now Joe obviously has great genes, and so does Trump, most of their handlers, and just about anyone who works in DC. The hours, travel, and stress are absolutely murder. If you don’t have a great constitution, you’d be dead in a couple of years. They have access to the best doctors, and POTUS the very best medical care possible, and yet few, other than the principals, last an entire term. 

So consider that Joe Biden has the very best medical care in the world, and he’s at the point where it can no longer compensate. 

As to the point about taking care of octogenarians - at that age a year’s aging is not like the “one” you are experiencing now. When you are in your 60s and 70s its two or three. In your 80s more like FIVE. Once the decline starts it is precipitous and fast. Some people only see it mentally, some only physically. Usually the mental side drives the physical side. Regardless, Biden is probably starting at the edge of both. I have serious doubts that if he wins he’ll make it to midterms. 

He’s being propped up as best as possible because the US cannot have an infirm president. It’s happened several other times in US history, most recently in the last 3 years of the Reagan administration. Ronnie had one thing going for him and that was an extremely robust physical condition. 

If you think otherwise its just wishful thinking and a lack of confidence that someone else could step up. That democrat could still ride the positive aspects of Joe’s work but it will require the party to produce a platform that isn’t Joe stumping his legacy.",r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYaUc5UkY2Qnp0RzFLc04xYkJTUElCMUNMVnBMNmxCSlhLV3VJdzAyd3VRUm80ZnN3c3dGOTZtVkZndG1HNG9ZYnd3VVVBdjVRMHg2aFZ1OVEwS0txSHc9PQ==
"I hear you, but in reality their are some very good actions being taken but well see how it plays out. Its just that people don't really hear about this stuff. In recent years, there have been renewed efforts to enforce antitrust laws in the United States. The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have taken steps to address concerns about market concentration and competition. In 2020, the DOJ filed a lawsuit against Google, alleging that the company had engaged in anticompetitive behavior in the online search and advertising market. 

 In 2021, the FTC filed a lawsuit against Facebook, alleging that the company had engaged in anticompetitive behavior in the social media market. In 2022, the DOJ filed a lawsuit against Meta Platforms, Inc. (formerly Facebook, Inc.), alleging that the company had engaged in anticompetitive behavior in the social media market.

 There has been increased scrutiny of large tech companies, such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon, due to concerns about their market power and potential anticompetitive behavior. The government has taken steps to investigate and potentially regulate these companies to ensure that they are not using their market power to harm competition.

 There have been legislative efforts to strengthen antitrust laws and provide more resources to the Antitrust Division and the FTC to enforce these laws. For example, the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which was introduced in 2021, aims to promote competition in the digital marketplace by prohibiting large tech companies from engaging in anticompetitive behavior.

 While there have been some challenges and controversies in the enforcement of antitrust laws in the United States, there are ongoing efforts to strengthen these laws and ensure that they are effectively enforced. The government is taking steps to address concerns about market concentration and competition, and there is increased scrutiny of large tech companies. While I don't think this is nearly enough, it is a start. 

 Likewise its important to educate the public about the real causes of inflation instead of the mindless flinger pointing when in reality their are many cause, not least of which was covid and the war in Ukraine. I am somewhat pessimistic but I also see reason to hope for the future.  In reality this nation has been through far worse. As bad as things are they are much better then people realize when you take the global situation into context. The United States has had the strongest recovery among the G7 economies, as measured by GDP, following the pandemic-induced recession. Other G7 economies, such as the United Kingdom and Germany, are still performing below trend. 

Overall, the US is taking steps to reinvest in manufacturing and supply lines, with a focus on building resilience, strengthening the middle class, and making things in America again. , the US government and defense industry are taking steps to rebuild the industrial defense base. Investing in research and development to improve domestic production capabilities. Encouraging businesses to enter the defense space or expand their capabilities. Strengthening the domestic supply base through initiatives like Title III of the Defense Production Act. Developing a force structure that mitigates risk and a budget that pays for it. All in all their are major changes and investments that are going to be felt over the next decades as America modernizes and advances. Its just that right now we face challenges and global concerns. 

 Its also true that whenever things get tough people tend to listen to anyone promising change and that is the danger.",r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYS0F6dll3WlZ5N3NWUXB0bGV5al8xbGZUM213WmFMUWdFaE5tamxjR0NRS2VNWTlSVy1XNjRVWDl4OVcwbkxMelN0MzQzN0ktNGNFRGkwbmZCUllmUWc9PQ==

The thief repeated, louder, ""Prayers with shoes on just disappear!"" After the third time, Nasrudin replied, ""Yes, you are right. But I hope at least the shoes do not disappear.""

"I appreciate the thoughts. I don’t agree. Biden had the luck of sucking at that debate. He was everything during those 90 minutes that people worried. Trump was everything they feared. It was bad, but it was an anomaly. It forced people to assess what they were voting for and, yes, there was a pile on of people saying he should go, based on those 90 minutes. So, the pile on forced a slap back from voters and from a base that recognized that a) Biden is still a very intelligent guy who achieved a whole bunch in very tough waters and b) people like the media and George Clooney are not going to tell them who to vote for. In the end it is going to be Biden vs a very damaged Donald Trump with his project 2025 anchor. I am sure that people will vote for Biden. I think it’s unlikely that the Dems have the stomach to push him out. Harris is already on the ticket, if Biden is as feeble as some people think, then she’ll be president soon enough.

So you are not disagreeing.

> The damage was done, we are barely recovered from it, there was no sweeping change.

We have not recovered at all, and we haven't hit bottom yet. But we're close to bottom. 

Biden announced an economic and ecological recovery program which wasn't 10% of what was necessary. And recent events in Ukraine and Israel show that to keep our existing international goals we need to at least double our military budget. Again. We're approaching 20% of GDP for healthcare. The obvious solution is to cut off more people from healthcare so they die and stop affecting the statistics, but that's no good. We need to find cheaper ways to get good results, but he argument is focused on keeping benefits or cutting them.

FIRE (Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate) is about 20% of GDP and rising. How can we possibly afford that? But who are the campaign donors?

I don't see a coup as any solution, it just looks increasingly inevitable. More and more people recognize that we don't have a government that can function. Not something we can fix by incrementally voting for more Democrats in Red states. 

Increasingly, it's turned into people like you saying we have to vote for Democrats so we can have democracy, and voters look around and say What Democracy?

And we have to vote Democrat to protect the Constitution, and we look around and say What Constitution?

"I am not disagreeing that without democrats in actual power, by having a majority in the house and the Senate and the presidency at least, they cannot get things passed NOW. By not voting them into power, their agenda, which is better than the republicans', cannot go through.

Okay, so did you not see the legislation that helped bring down pharma costs? brought down child poverty? improved the infrastructure? brought manufacturing jobs back to America? That the unions, which are the blue-collar, middle class jobs, have been championed by Biden, where he was actually walking their picket lines and helping in their negotiations? that people not making $15 or above has dropped from \\~30% to \\~10%?

Have you really missed all that? Those were actually good things.

The states and SCOTUS (aided by Trump's right-wing supreme court additions, who wouldn't have been there if people had voted for Hillary in the swing states), worked together to knock down the Roe vs. Wade ruling, and are chipping away at women's rights. Voting for a democratic majority, they would be able to put Roe into law. That isn't good?

I don't know about the statistics you listed, but look: allowing republicans power the situation, all over the place, will get way, way worse. Getting democrats in (failing having a decent, progressive party that is electable), will at least get what good can be done.

Hey, the democracy is us voting. I can't stand all the times I've heard idiots say Obama wan't giving them what they want, after they stayed home when voting time came and the republicans took over both chambers of congress. You need a solid democratic majority. And In this case, if republicans get in, there might truly not be a real democracy, where people vote for their representatives. I'm not sure what you aren't seeing here.

"I'm hoping I can bring some clarity to where we are and how we got here by simply saying: racism, misogyny and homophobia. 

The modern Republican Party (Reagan onward) is nothing but a huge backlash against the social progress made in the 1960s and 70s by blacks, women and, more recently, the LGBTQ+ community. That is around the time that black people were suddenly allowed in white spaces, including schools. Women were suddenly allowed their own credit cards, the birth control pill, and no-fault divorce. Please remember that right after these changes, the following things occurred. 

* The Republican Party turned against government. ""Government *is* the problem"" - Ronald Reagan. (Even Democrats had to get in on the trend: ""The era of big government is over"" - Bill Clinton.) They have since that time been against virtually every policy that might materially benefit average Americans in any way.
* Evangelicals suddenly developed strong feelings about abortion. (No, really. They didn't used to care at all.)
* The NRA went from a gun safety club to a crazy gun rights lobbying group. (1977, look it up.) 

And we've been living with that backlash for the last forty plus years. Then, more recently, a black family lived in the White House for eight years and gay people can get married now. 

The time is right for someone like Trump, whose only differentiator was his open racism and obvious misogyny. That was his appeal and it still is. Finally, sopmeone is going to defend our precious Way Of Life (read: white supremacy and patriarchy).

And now the current chapter seemingly is: this movement is enthusiastically embracing authoritarianism and minority rule if it's the only way they can get what they want.

"It's something of a common thread in history.

"You said that we're ""heading into the situation that many cultures who had a massively armed population have before"" 

I would argue that comparisons to ancient arms or attempts to disarm people are strained at best. A Japanese warlord taking swords away from those of lower social class isn't remotely similar to a modern democratic government attempting to disarming the public. (BTW, didn't Toyotomi Hideyoshi become a paranoid tyrant?)

Contrast that to the heavily armed American Colonies who evolved into an incredible peaceful and prosperous nation, or the Wild West that did the same. 

If there is a pattern in history, it's tyrants disarming the public before tyranny.",r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnTWNJeDZnNTlDdUY2UnBDeVVmNExMenQzWXZ2LUJJSEtNNTJ6UkdpcG9IaFdfNnRncEdSTjlBMThiNjY5ckVPcF8xWDVENV9xNVNQaGYyczJFOS0wNkE9PQ==

"When a person fears for their life or the lives of those they care about, do you honestly think they’ll wait for their opponents to make the first move? That makes sense to you? You mean to tell me that you would actually sit around and wait for armed gunmen to not only surround your house, but to start shooting at your house before you start shooting back? Are you familiar with the concept of “preemptive strikes?” Do you understand when and why those are employed in matters of war?

I ask these questions in a rhetorical sense, really just to highlight how blurry the line between defense and aggression actually is. You want to look at this issue on a micro-scale, likening it to a situation of two armed individuals facing each other. The law dictates that, in situations like that, one person must *reasonably* fear for their life before taking lethal action. Only then can the first shooter claim self-defense. Otherwise, it’s aggression.

That same concept does not apply to the political stage. It doesn’t apply to assassinations. I promise you, if you metaphorically dissected the minds of every assassin and would-be assassin throughout human history, you will find that just about every single one of them believed that they were defending something or someone.

The senators who stabbed Caesar believed they were defending the Roman Republic from the tyranny of Caesar’s growing power. John Wilkes Booth believed he was defending Southern culture from the tyranny of Northern abolitionists. Gavrilo Princip thought he could defend the Balkans from the tyranny of Austro-Hungarian rule. In their minds, meaning on a psychological level, they were all acting in self-defense and/or defense of others.

Your inability to understand this notwithstanding, when the NRA tells people that their guns can also be used to protect the American people from tyranny, people WILL connect the dots on their own. They will start to believe that they can defend themselves by assassinating political pot-stirrers before they get a chance to become oppressive. It’s simple human psychology. “Why wait until that person is holding a gun to my head? If they’re saying that’s what they’re going to do, I’ll just shoot them before they get the chance. Why take the risk?”

So as I stated in my post, regardless of whether he was right or wrong, Thomas M. Crooks deemed Trump a tyrant and sought to **defend** America from a hypothetical Trump tyranny. You trying to split hairs between defense and aggression in matters of political assassination seems to woefully misrepresent and misunderstand how people think and behave.

Shame.",r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnY0xsRmZYYXdTMG9lOFpmOUd2TWdzRnJhRllra2FIckhFY0Y2LU1tRkJYSHhqUi01a0l1MnAxRVNqdmlqa0lubXp2WmptWnZqcDNyNW45MXVkS3JuWlE9PQ==
"Yes. 

Yes, good guys, who are acting in defense, resist the urge to attack premptively. 

The line is not blurry. If you really struggle with the concept, go take a concealed carry course. It will help you to understand so that you don't look silly. 

Despite your claims, most normal people do understand this concept - even NRA members. That's why, though there are hundreds of thousands of gun owners in the United States, and a large percentage of them feel that our government is trending tyrannical, they aren't attacking their government.",r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnZnc3dXBoelBjeGJjcTRtZU83SEV3MVBjRHBvX1B5RWdSZjdhUHpaVDdEQU5TWm5FYUZzTUVVVnc5S21LOTFpVHZ0U2VTaDAzQUd6ZENURHFhcnpSY0E9PQ==
