"Polkagold: The Premier Digital Reserve Asset for Polkadot

In a visionary interview on 06/11/2023, Dr. Gavin Wood, the co-founder of Polkadot, expressed his desire to see the Polkadot Treasury hold assets beyond the Polkadot ecosystem, diversifying its portfolio. This sparked the idea of creating a digital commodity akin to gold, a reserve asset that the Polkadot Treasury could own, yet hosted on an entirely different blockchain.

Polkagold aims to become the premier reserve digital commodity for Polkadot, filling the gap left by the absence of a true digital gold that underpins the economy as a reserve asset for the treasury to acquire.

### The Polkagold Advantage

While Polkadot already boasts native stablecoins like USDT and USDC on AssetHub for stable currency transfers, and the DOT utility token for transaction fees, governance, staking, and network security, Polkagold offers a unique proposition as a non-inflationary digital asset.

Polkagold will have a fixed supply of 10,000,000 coins produced at genesis, ensuring its scarcity and value preservation. This novel concept seeks to mimic the fair launch of Bitcoin, where even early adopters had to acquire their coins through mining.

### A Fair and Transparent Launch

Polkagold's launch is designed to be the most fair and transparent in the crypto space since Bitcoin, with:

- 0% allocated to the team
- 0% allocated to founders
- 0% allocated for marketing
- 100% of the supply dedicated to exchange liquidity

Polkagold launched on exchanges during the early bootstrap phase, with the entire supply immediately put into circulation as part of the liquidity pool. This innovative ""Proof of Purchase"" (PoP) concept ensures that every single Polkagold in existence had to be purchased, just like the early Bitcoin adopters had to mine their coins.

## The Synergy of Algorand and Polkadot

Polkagold's security is provided by the Algorand blockchain, chosen for its exceptional security track record, exhibiting zero downtime, zero failed transactions, and zero on-chain hacks since its inception. Algorand was created by Turing Award winner Silvio Micali, widely regarded as the father of modern cryptography.

While Algorand boasts a large community and focuses on enterprise-grade usage, it has yet to find widespread adoption among mainstream cryptocurrency users. Polkagold aims to bridge this gap by driving strong usage for the Algorand coin, bolstering usage on Algorand DEXes, Total Value Locked (TVL), and 24-hour trading volume.

### Mutual Benefits for Algorand and Polkadot

The appeal of a fairly launched, non-inflationary commodity like Polkagold in the current global landscape is undeniable. By bootstrapping and locking the entire Genesis wallet liquidity exclusively on Algorand DEXes and ALGO/PGOLD trading pairs, Polkagold creates a virtuous cycle:

1. To acquire PGOLD, users must first acquire ALGO coins.
2. If not already an Algorand user, they must open an Algorand wallet (likely Pera Wallet).
3. Users then trade their ALGO for PGOLD, increasing TVL, transaction volume on Algorand DEXes, and demand for PGOLD.
4. Increased demand from more users drives further acquisition of ALGO coins, perpetuating the cycle.

This flow perpetually drives demand for PGOLD, bringing new users to the Algorand blockchain and creating a snowballing demand for ALGO's native coin, as well as increasing TVL and transaction volume across the Algorand DeFi landscape.

For the Polkadot community, Polkagold controls two wallets:

1. A wallet on Algorand that holds the Genesis Wallet for the 10,000,000 hard-capped supply LP, locked for 20 years and 5 years, respectively.
2. A wallet on Polkadot that has locked out the ticker PGOLD, the name Polkagold, and the Asset ID#79 (the elementary number for Gold), ensuring no copycat token can be created on Polkadot.

This whitepaper grants ownership of the Algorand Genesis Wallet to the Polkadot Treasury, which can be claimed by the Web3 Foundation Official Twitter Account or Gavin Wood's Official Twitter account by sending a DM to the Polkagold Official Twitter account. Upon contact, the private keys and seed phrase of the Genesis Polkagold Wallet on Algorand will be handed over securely and free of charge to the Polkadot Treasury.

As the Algorand and Polkadot communities acquire PGOLD, it becomes a more distributed commodity, and any value accrual will benefit the Polkadot Treasury, which acquired the Genesis Wallet at no cost. However, the Polkadot Treasury won't be able to sell or access the PGOLD until the lock-up periods expire.

## A Win-Win for Algorand and Polkadot

Polkagold aims to bring together the combined liquidity, communities, and market caps of two major blue-chip projects, synergizing to create the hardest and most fairly distributed asset in crypto – PGOLD.

It's a win-win for both Algorand and Polkadot, as it synergizes their communities, bringing together their combined users and trading volume for mutual benefits.

"So in a Nutshell there was an interview with the Kusamarian in it Dr. Gavin Wood said the PolkaDot Treasury should have a diverse set of assets that are NOT in the form of DOT or KUS and would like to see commodities such as traditional Gold etc.

From there the concept of PolkaGold came about built on Algorand because of low transaction fees and speed.

The coin came out as a fair launch everyone had to purchase. 0 for the team, just like EVERYONE ELSE MERITOCRATIC.

The premise of this project is that the Genesis  wallet will be gifted to the PolkaDot web 3 foundation or Dr. Gavin Wood himself for 🆓 so PolkaDot can have the diverse set of assets in its Treasury.

I can choose to support BTC with my node or mining rig, or I can choose not to, or to support something else such as BCH.

If no one supports the current version of BTC, it will cease to exist. Devs create options and we collectively decide on what option lives. Just because a small groups develop options, it doesn't mean they have any control as to what gets adopted (what changes happen to the most-adopted version)

Whereas in polkadot, the whales control what changes happen to the most adopted version. It is FAR more centralised in that sense.

"It's really not that complicated, the actual answer is:

On Moonbeam via StellaSwap DEX

All these 4 locations support swapping PINK to DOT, which is what OP's question is. Everything else is just how to get your DOT from whatever location you swapped it on to Polkadot Relay Chain (but that was ... not the question) , which OP might not even want, maybe they want the DOT to be transferred to Bifrost? 

P.S.:  You seem to describe ""sum up the issue with multi-chain networks"" , rather than the issue with polkadot.  the same ""issue"" of transferring assets is present in any other L1-L2 systems.  ""The UX issue in Polkadot"" doesn't actually exist... using a noob-friendly UI (like Talisman for example) is easier than using MetaMask.   I understand your concern (even if I don't fully agree with it), but painting this as a ""polkadot problem"" tells me that you either don't use the easy UIs or you don't use other multi-chain networks.",r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjVE9Oc2pRTnoxRnVzVHZFODNDeDBMUlNWblprZU02YUYzbG1TQVJLellwcS1ibUpOaUpUSHEySHc3T3FyTG5pN05qcDJpS2xORE10SV9sbzJZUWlhMmd0b2hlbXA1RXpvZlNEemg0U05aMTg9
"""The issue is the bridging xcASSETS between chains in my opinion""

xcASSETS are just native Polkadot assets bro (transferred via XCM), it's the same token, but called differently on Moonbeam. This is a Moonbeam specific denomination, made in order to differentiate from assets bridged from other networks (since Moonbeam is an EVM enabled chain, and the expectation was that assets will fly in from other EVM chains).

Imagine in your head each time you see an ""xcAsset"" that you can't read ""xc"".  There's no swap occurring, it's the same asset.  Maybe that will help you in some way? Transferring ""xcAssets"" is the same as transferring assets via IBC in Cosmos and more secure than transferring ETH from L1 to L2s or transferring SOL from Solana to Ethereum via Wormhole, or etc etc etc.  Is your problem just bridging in general? Do you want just monolithic chains?

And lastly, your analogy is completely weird (on top of being inaccurate).  When you transfer an asset from Chain A to Chain B is like transferring USD from Bank A to Bank B, in scenario in which Bank A is not supported for your transaction (for whatever reason).  The solution to the problem of unnecessary transfers for end-users is the same in web3 as it was with banks =  increase interoperability, either directly/natively or via middlemen (enter Visa and Mastercard).  The ability to transfer assets ""via backend when contract is executed"" (to quote you exactly) already exists on Polkadot, and it is in use on some parachains. Projects just need to use the tech lol, not all of them do. (*for example: you can perform DeFi actions on Acala by using DOT on Moonbeam, with all bridging occurring in the background, all in 1 click -- this fact alone kills your entire argument and narrative of a ""problem of polkadot""*)",r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjU1o3VE5PaHNEaG1tQjR1cWc3cHFxa25OYWE0emt5MUhENGxQT0xKTnJZSHhJTjRGT0ZoQjltRkNCRHBWSVozNVA5enlPYkdMSDFPX0pGZmhKeVNzaFZRT3lsWkVFXzhTV0h0dXZQV3VHTUU9

"*When I said ""importing the funds in another wallet"" i mean import the 24 seedphrase of the respective signners in a new software wallet to move the fund*

This would not change anything on-chain. The problem is with the smart contract code, which cannot be modified. Accessing it with other wallet is like you having the wrong key for your car, and then making a copy of the key to get it to work.

*it's impossible to recover the funds without forking the chain? I found a Gavin Wood interview in the internet (can't confirm if is real) and he was asked for this, but refuses to give a anwser just getting of the topic.*

Correct, a fork is necessary. This is what EIP-999 was all about, which was rejected by the Ethereum community. See [https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-999.md](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-999.md) 

I don't know what interview you read/watched, but Web3 Foundation was very up-front about what needed to happen to recover funds. See [https://medium.com/web3foundation/an-update-on-the-web3-foundation-d905128f15a9](https://medium.com/web3foundation/an-update-on-the-web3-foundation-d905128f15a9)

"Despite Ledger's recent controversies, they're still one of the ""safer"" and easier staking options. If you have a large amount of DOT, you could take an approach of splitting them up between different wallets to mitigate risks around storing them all on one wallet. If you're comfortable with storing decently large amounts on hot wallets, then Nova or Talisman are likely the best options at the moment.

I still use Ledger for a large % of my staking despite their multiple shit shows, since I trust them more than CEXs + hot wallets and it's easy enough to use with https://polkadot.js.org/. For hot wallets, I use Nova when doing swaps and using dapps on other parachains etc. I also used to stake on Nova and my experience was great back then.

Edit: It seems Nova has gone fully open source, so that's also a huge plus. Much of their team came from Fearless, which used to be a good wallet. After I experienced multiple glitches and unstaking issues on Fearless, I switched to Nova and the experience with them has been much better.",r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlQ0N2d3VJTG1yT3QzSnF2MlhldXEwTG5OOGYyNmZXWUxpX2dJRERBekQxWkpyTThIQXREcUlSa3pJZzBFR1EyTGFGYjQ0WUNwR01OdnUtcUh3NTJ3cWc9PQ==

"Just so you know, most of these questions are already answered on the Polkadot Wiki ( [https://wiki.polkadot.network/](https://wiki.polkadot.network/) ). That is always the best place to go when you need a question answered.

*The governance treasury is a lot of DOT locked and the proposals are the only way to spend it?*

Yes, it's a special account on the network. Governance (OpenGov) is actually the only way to spend it, but in practice this is generally done via Treasury Proposals, a subset of OpenGov referenda. You can see the account here: [https://polkadot.subscan.io/account/13UVJyLnbVp9RBZYFwFGyDvVd1y27Tt8tkntv6Q7JVPhFsTB](https://polkadot.subscan.io/account/13UVJyLnbVp9RBZYFwFGyDvVd1y27Tt8tkntv6Q7JVPhFsTB)

*Any token holder is able to submit a proposal? Even with 1 DOT?*

Slightly more than 1 DOT for transaction fees and a submission deposit, but yes. See [https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury#submit-treasury-proposal-via-polkassembly](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury#submit-treasury-proposal-via-polkassembly) for instructions.

*The voters receive some reward for doing this?*

No reward is given by the network for voting on proposals. Some proposals (or other referenda) include people rewarding people with NFTs or other rewards, but this is not necessary.

*The resources from Treasury are for maintening the project alive? Like funding new projects*

It's for whatever the DOT holders think is useful for the network. This includes things like marketing, block explorers, wallets, events, etc. You can take a look at the previous Treasury Proposals here to get an idea: [https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda) 

*Where does the DOT in Treasury come from?*

Mostly transaction fees and staking efficiencies, but there's a detailed description on the Wiki here: [https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury#treasury-inflow-and-outflow](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury#treasury-inflow-and-outflow)",r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuN194elFFRUh1MlltRkFvQktKbTB4UmVzMHQzeW1CX2Y4WDViMmpuRkNxQ05rWTFMNzVHRWxJOFBuck5wT2p2VTc2S3NJVjlhQXFGc01JbnJ2dXM5cmc9PQ==
"Thanks. But this got up nother question.

  
The power vote is proportional to DOT hold, so if voters don't receive any incentive for doing this, let's suppose a theorical case. Imagine that bigger holders of DOT stop voting for any reason and small holders join forces to do big spends on Treasury for his private wallet, is it possible or exist a mechanism to prevent this like minimum votes according to amount to be spent?",r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuT29ZMVNNVlVpampPek9nSEJpVUNDUldLZlhxSjk1MU5tWlBTYk9fTGJrWmNCaTdyVTJmWFZmWnNyeElhclU5MEw1ajh4c0diaVVHX1B6cHFKU0pKMjZWWmZXcVJzLW8zRzBZcHNxbEJaZlU9

"Tech-wise? There's only a few other protocols attempting to accomplish interoperability with the security that DOT offers. I get the sense that NEAR is trying to become a underlying OS layer that bridges Web 2 and Web 3 as well, and they seem to do a better job of generating value on the price side. They have the advantage of aligning with the AI narrative. This probably won't be a popular opinion here since most people in crypto are tribal, but I hold all of DOT, NEAR, ATOM, (and many other cryptos) anyway.

My main concern with DOT is on the financial side since I agree that the tokenomics and demand drivers are still a huge question mark.  ATOM suffers from a similar issue and they've struggled with generating value for ATOM while having arguably worse security than DOT. I will say that I much prefer interacting with the ATOM ecosystem though. I agree with folks that the UI / UX is severely lacking in the DOT ecosystem, but some hot wallets like Nova / Talisman do appear to remedy that a little.

Another big question mark for me is the love-hate relationship I have with Open Gov. Conceptually, I like the idea and I have been participating in most of the votes. However, it pisses me off when influencers get a large amount of DOT from the treasury. I'm sure a lot of this stuff goes on behind the scenes for other cryptos and it's just more in the open with DOT since you can see the proposals and what amount of DOT they're asking for. I know that some shitty proposals have been shut down successfully by the community, but we still have a long ways to go. 

Anyway, despite my concerns, DOT is still one of my largest positions. I don't plan on selling until the next altseason heats up (assuming it comes).",r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvVkFDd0JDYmNaWTVvdkRBa2NfZGc2Qms4aGpQek9RbHNxVzBoeEtIUHhaZE1XU09yb1RvdXQwdkpCZF9CMWZZWWJKVEh4Z2VkbUQyZDVRVTltVGtPUFE9PQ==

"Polkaswap is not created by Parity/Polkadot, it's a separate project built on top of a Polkadot L2 (parachain), more specifically SORA Network.  Polkaswap and Sora are created by the same team, called Soramitsu, with the CEO and Co-Founder being Makoto Takemiya.

You didn't really describe what the issue is, but sounds like you lost coins while bridging? How exactly?  It doesn't seem to me like you even know who you want to sue and why.

P.S.:  Polkadot is a public blockchain, which means that if someone knows your public address, they can see the activity of that address (*and if someone more knowledgeable in crypto than you looks at that data, it might look like they know more about what happened hence appearing incriminating, even though you both have the same amount of information available to look at... FYI some food for thought*)",r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvQzNNbzFkTFlPSFBsclhrb0FYblFoVmEzeGQ0cmNXRVJhaWhCRjlpRVE0N3hqX1gxZzAyRV9RMGpzWlFaUkZhOXNGZzhHT0s4am5uVlpzMFE4WXNHLWw2cDZwRnotamZWZ0tsaHBNelZsRlE9
"Unfortunately Composable is going the wrong direction... more and more centralized (coming from someone that's been a crowdloan participant and been following them up until I participated in their mantis restaking for SOL bridge launch).

What was supposed to be trustless bridging turned into trust-minimized (which is just marketing jargon for ""not trustless bridging""), much like their main website changing from [trustless.zone](http://trustless.zone) to [app.picasso.network](http://app.picasso.network)

They chose to start building on Substrate because they admit it's the better tech, then pivot to pushing IBC since it was easier  to create a marketing narrative around it instead of XCM and slowly moving to Cosmos ecosystem from Polkadot, then changed narratives 3 times while in Cosmos ecosystem and then now jumped on the SOL restaking hype (after missing the ETH one due to internal restructures/delays/etc)

I no longer believe in their vision (which changed and rebranded way too many times already, these guys pivot more than an NBA player) or what they're trying to sell. Their initial pitch and vision, even if they chose to go with IBC as the messaging protocol, was what was attractive.  Instead, now they have a tech stack that's a combination of trustless and centralized customizable bridges (which makes the entire thing... semi-centralized at best), and that really doesn't differentiate them from other products out there (eg: Axelar completely taking their whole use-case being the main reason why they switched narratives to restaking)

Oh, and to answer your question... yeah, I tried it. It didn't improve my life at all, even though I'm in Dot, Eth and Sol ecosystems lol",r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvYllyX0ZPLXc5MEFSYld0c25tRHVIeGphLTJ0NmJUMm1wWnIwTXEzX29vWXNLY1FFMDN6YmFobnFEUnlrek5Ua0xyS1hEZ2djUUtSa1pDSjVwd3FmSm5RUGducGc1THNrME5FTnRmeHRta009

"I'm sorry to hear that you've had a negative experience. It can be disappointing when a project doesn't align with its initial vision or when changes in direction are frequent. However, it's great to see the insights you've shared based on your firsthand experience and observations.

Change and evolution in the blockchain space are not uncommon, and projects often need to adapt to market conditions and technological advancements. While it's understandable that these shifts can be unsettling, they can also present new opportunities for growth and innovation.

It's important for projects to listen to community feedback, especially from contributors like yourself, in order to continuously improve and refine their offerings.

"Loved Polkadot. Then started listening to Robert Breedlove’s “What is Money” videos. Now I simply see inflation as a non consensual tax. Inflation just debases the value of something over time. The only way to not get debased in any POS blockchain is to keep 100% of your asset staking.  
And if 100% of it is staked what utility are you really gaining from using it? 

The obvious alternative is liquid staking. But then that’s no better than our current fiat. You simply use an IOU of your asset. And getting away from that setup was the whole reason I fell in love with blockchain.",r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4U3Y1MFVNbHJlbDJ2dzZVR2FpalhWMTZiX3NCSjllUU9JUU9Fc005enFLekVlQ2huTjRlU0lnTkYxQmxWeURHRUNLZF8yTVR1cWktTS16LWxEZkJGbFE9PQ==

"Yes, dot debases by ~10% a year.  Yes, cash one person takes out is cash another person puts in.  Value is subjective.  If you believe the narrative that the future internet must be decentralized and that Polkadot is foundational infrastructure for that, then you probably conclude that dot has a very high net present value that you are willing to pay for because the price will go up and you will be receiving a high yield on top of that.

"I gave up on Polkadot a long time ago. Staking was (and probably still is) too complicated to understand for many.

In Polkadot's defence, most crypto projects have failed to deliver any kind of useful utility despite the endless development and partnership announcements.

If this bull run fails to lift even a handful of alts out of their depressed state, it's likely to set crypto back by a generation, or destroy most of it forever.

Even bitcoin has hit a wall, and despite the continuing inflows, enough people don't believe it can go much higher and are selling in equal volumes.",r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4REtwelItUk9pempGdkZmYXNCX2hPNWxXNFFiWFlJNDVQdlZTYmpGZXZlTDVvV29EOXlyOUMyZ1BhaHduT2JkLVdSbWRnNzVwVVBLUkh0RzhnRkVubHc9PQ==

"I am not a expert on the economics of crypto, including $DOT, but what I have gathered is the less there is of it and the more utility it has, the more its exchange value is.  $DOT is 85% down from its all time high for almost 2 years now, and while from a conventional investment point of view its appreciation in its price sucks, but I will argue the value of $DOT is much higher and is extremely undervalued.

Polkadot has been off the SEC radar making a claim that $DOT is not a security, it is a utility, core-JAM will create more value when it matures because now $DOT is required to fuel the cores of PolkaVM.  Occasional burning of $DOT tokens keep the price in check, and staking is the only real way to earn cash positive yields.

I guess 10% is ok, but it is like robbing peter to pay paul, I would like to  see the inflation to adjust to 2% or 3%, so yields would produce move value when staking.

"As somebody that is moderately computer-savvy and pays attention enough to manage most things via internet, it is absurd to try to move money between the absurd number of networks safely. It is no wonder money disappears from people's accounts. Many times it's probably their own oops but it also leaves them hugely vulnerable to slimy thieves. It is a tricky thing to just move money from an ethereum or Bitcoin Network over to avalanche or Cosmos or polkadot. 
If mass adoption is the goal then there needs to be diligent work from the upper powers of blockchain technology to police the scammers and the fake promotions of coin releases. So many of these supposed experts of the industry seem to be bought and paid for by these scammers and fraudsters. There are no real repercussions either. It is very difficult to find actual in-depth investigative news about the different companies. You have to rely on their honesty and nobody seems to be thoroughly checking into them.

"More Polkadot people should be on Reddit. That's one feedback. Lol.

Honestly, I think Twitter (X) is pretty bad for in-depth discussions. First, the whole tweet layout is terrible for lengthy convos and Twitter blocks non-account holders from seeing what's up anyway. Plus, people are usually highlighted there based on their following, not necessarily the quality of the points that they make. And it's a pain to get a following - which makes the use of personal twitters sometimes necessary, which I think stifles the diversity of convo since not everyone's into being not-anonymous in a CRYPTO community. On Reddit, some total rando can comment and it can be upvoted or downvoted to sh*t - doesn't matter if they're well-known or not - and people won't know the person, just the idea. Sure Reddit has its downsides too, but it's pretty good overall and definitely should be focused on a bit more. 

Polkadot forum is OK but not really good for starting a big community conversation IMO and way more tech-focused than anything else. 

Aside from that, we SERIOUSLY need a Polkadot DeFi hub where every Polkadot DeFi app is listed on one website with total metrics being tracked like TVL, daily trading volume, etc. DeFiLLama is NOT good for this - due to their interests, the rule structure, etc. It'd be great if we had a website someone could easily load up and BAM they perfectly see everything that's goin' on in Polkadot DeFi. DeFiLlama is literally missing hundreds of millions of Polkadot ecosystem TVL which is just totally unlisted atm, making Polkadot appear less competitive than it actually is. This desperately needs to be fixed in order to attract more people into the ecosystem. It's like the most basic marketing thing we can do that doesn't even require a huge activation.

"To each their own, however the inflation rate is set at 10%, it doesn't go up the more people that stake, not sure where you heard that. Not sure what you mean by ""buy anything on the network"" but DOT is a utility token which is used for staking, governance, and purchasing block space. A 28 day unbonding period is there for a reason, that is to give time to slash a bad actor before they act nefariously and just unbond and get away with it. This gives us time to spot a bad actor and slash their stake. It actually makes the network more secure and secure block space is the best block space. Everything feels harder because Polkadot is a security layer, it's not a L1 like Solana which is more akin to Moonbeam or another L1 secured by Polkadot. This will also completely change with JAM. Comparing Polkadot to Solana is comparing squirrels to apples, completely different things. Compare L1s to L1s, nor security layers to L1s, but again, this will completely change with JAM. Solana may be ""faster"" (now | think multiple cores processing concurrently), but can it handle the traffic of the entire Internet like Polkadot will be able to do? Is it absolutely, unequivocally decentralized? Does it have 100% open, decentralized governance? Can it be stopped? There are many reasons to go back to Polkadot if you understand the direction Polkadot is heading and what it is looking to accomplish. I would rather be a part of securing the decentralized Internet of the future compared to trading memecoins and NFTs for a quick profit. There will come a time that you will be using Polkadot without even realizing that you are using Polkadot, and you will be happy. But like I already said, to each their own.

"I don't know what you mean exactly by ""circulating supply"". The total issuance increases by 10% annually. Obviously this will mean that more tokens are added each year, there is no specific number (e.g. 10% of x compared to the next year, which would be 10% of (x + 10%)). Some of this is redirected to the Treasury, some of \\_that\\_ is eventually burnt. This is explained in further detail in the link I posted.

  
Note that there is already some talk about setting a maximum cap and removing token issuance from control of on-chain governance.

"Rust. You've got to start with Rust.

1) Setup a rust environment in your computer. If you have a windows machine, avoid rust for windows and use WSL to run rust. Learn the language, create multiple projects. Get familiar with cargo.

2) Once you got a handle on Rust, start digging into web assemblies. This pieces of code are the key. They can run on pretty much any environment once built and they are the key for block chain logic. 

3) The next step is the solo substrate node. Clone the repo, build it and run it. If you've done step 1 and 2, you'll find this familiar. Once you've got it running (you should be able to talk to the node over https), you can start experimenting with custom logic on the runtime.

here’s my basic ass understanding of it: you know how third parties like Coinbase allow you to swap your crypto? well parachains like Polkadot strive to remove the need for a third party like Coinbase. the technology allows you to swap directly between blockchains,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3aEt2MEYtcTZsaDRieTFzNENwR01Qa1lFOTd4b0RkQnVhUXFjVmlvbzVDMEVPRW1kWXZTT0VqU3F2ZWROcmVHS09oSGJBak41VEQ1MWlhSjRyS1VvOGc9PQ==
"Okay I will explain. 

Polkadot is a blockchain for developers. Developers use the Polkadot blockchain to host their own blockchains. 

Users then use *those* L1 chains and they function just like any other blockchain, but they have various benefits due to being hosted on Polkadot. For example, they are backed by much greater security than if they were independent, and they are able to better communicate with other blockchains on Polkadot. 

The reason why Polkadot isn't simpler is because it wasn't made primarily for retail investors; it was made for blockchain developers first and foremost. 

Yes, Polkadot can benefit from being easier to use. However, someone actually needs to spend the time and resources in order to do that. And that just simply isn't a priority, because the priority will always be the developer experience. And realistically, developers are going to have a higher base level of technical knowledge than some clueless retail ""investor"" in the crypto space. 

So, what is the logical reason why we should dedicate valuable resources to cater to the needs of retail investors? So that they can throw in a few thousand dollars, hold, and do nothing else? And that's assuming they would even put in a few thousand dollars. I've seen people throwing like $300 and then calling it a day. But what does that actually do for the ecosystem? The buying pressure is miniscule compared to rich people, and wealthy people presumably are going to know a little bit more about what they're investing in, and are going to take the time to do the research, rather than expecting people to spell everything out for them. 

And if we dedicate resources towards simplifying everything, we are then going to sacrifice the other resources we could have developed, like making a better developer experience, which is supposed to be the number one priority. I would take one star developer over a hundred meaningless retail investors. Devs are just inherently more valuable to the ecosystem.

Besides, it's totally possible for people to learn about Polkadot on their own. Thousands of people have already done it.",r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3OTVxZFhaUnhDR255MDdJLXBYYkttcmZWMVctUkg3RDVKM2VlTkVqZENZWWJTMjl3ZVhKSWNiVzRfS0ppenNOblpDTHJjbTJHSkJnYzAyTGVDZHdwWGc9PQ==

"lol bro investment talk isn’t allowed? The coin is still JUST a store of value like all the other coins and currently dot and all the alt coins haven’t budged this year with BTC skyrocketing. So yeh the tech is great but it’s still a store of value and basically useless apart from that. 99% of people in the world have never heard of dot. So if price talk isn’t allowed here, tell us why all the investors shouldn’t dump our bags here and crash the project?

"Its already passed the point of no return. It failed to make itself relevant. Parachains bust, tokenomics dilute the supply everyday, there’s no decent marketing with a plan because there is no decent plan. 

The thing is, as an investment , it’s not even moving with the general market anymore, unless it’s downwards. So I just don’t see how polkadot is an interesting for a regular person..

I’d suggest to move on. You don’t want to be in a project like this. The tech can be there but there is no plan, it’s just stringing along. Even hodling doesn’t workout due to the way the tokenomics work.

I’m getting eos vibes from this, as in, they wasted way too much time, had superior tech but too overly complicated for most people, leadership wasn’t there etc. Now, years later when a lot of projects surpassed their tech, they vouch to take on the inflation and work again, but it’s just too late, nobody cares anymore.",r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3N0RvclJGOGtXN2o3SVlIZkI1X3BlS29MdUpNS0F3T0J1ZTU1Wm1RTnQ2NnRNYnVGQ0JHZFBxbEVJY00zQnlKcTVBYnVCcG5sVERqeFhQSlB0QVBndEE9PQ==

When I think ""bureaucratism"" I think Kafkaesque rules and restrictions, almost the opposite of what we have now. But perhaps something different was meant by the word?

">Here in the US you can't really do it because a tax purposes so all you can really do is on chain staking.

Not sure why you're saying this... but you got something wrong along the way.  In US, Liquid Staking is just treated as another token (so it's a swap/transfer), since the LDOT/sDOT/vDOT is just understood as another property, due to being just an IOU token (remember, crypto in US is still treated as property asset).   In regards to the risk of depeg, counter-party, etc.... I agree with you.

>This is a great change that's not going to jeopardize the security of the network 

No... blanket setting the unbonding period at 1-2 days, as the OP suggest, will absolutely jeopardize security and pretty much ensure system instability after the increase of the active validator set to 500 (which is coming up on Relay Chain).

The only way to reduce the unbond period is to make it dynamic and adaptive, on a weighted queuing system (which seems to be the direction that jonas from W3F is going for). This **will not** result in a ""1-2 day unbond period"" for almost anyone (sans edge cases).  It will simply reduce the unbond period when nobody else is unbonding... and it will increase it when a lot of ppl are unbonding (aka relative to what's in the queue).

>There really is no downside to this change coming

Read again above. Your analysis is inaccurate.

Also, to re-iterate.... if the only reason to make this change is because people think the price will go up (which is what OP is preaching), then I disagree with the change.  Because the end-result (obviously it won't result in a price increase, ppl that've been long enough in crypto have seen this play out before) might have a worse effect on retail users than simply keeping the status-quo.",r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNET3A2OFB4a2ZRRzZXcTlncU5uWlRvS0tqdklkb05VcWFNdWpMc1FtUEZaeE00dDJWaEdsMlRwS2dYTjVnVFJPdHNxSTJVTFN2QUNkVkMtdDAzdVpfUjZ4V0tpYXI1QUpmZldTUzFWSmllQTQ9
"First of all you need to learn the difference between how long-term and short-term gains are factored in to US taxes...

When you swap a liquid staking token, Even being an IOU, for actual dot that is then considered taxable event and it resets the clock for capital gains taxes. (I work with many accounts on this exact topic).

So now you'll be on the hook for 40% in capital gains versus 20% in capital gains depending on the amount of profit unless you then hold that dot for a year...


Also you clearly have not read what the RFC proposes. 
There is absolutely no risk to security whatsoever. 

What happens is there is a queue of people that want to unbond. If the queue is small then you can withdraw within 2 days. In the event that the queue is filling up with a lot of people that want to unbond, The time to unbond then increases all the way up to 28 days as we have now.

You can't understand why somebody would ever want to unstake their assets and sell them at the peak of a market top?  Or would want to sell rewards?

You also don't understand what the RFC is proposing clearly. If the network is slow to unbond then you can withdraw within 2 days. Is the network is busy to withdraw then It will take longer all the way up until 28 days. Right now for example there's a lot more DOT being state daily then there is trying to be withdrawn, hence why we're back at almost the 60% ideal staking rate.

Because the way liquid staking works is there's no actual way to trace on chain when you receive those particular rewards. 

This means that anytime you cash out your rewards is when you have to start the timer for capital gains...

"I don't think bifrost support ledger yet, but I might be wrong on that. The only risk is if bifrost were to fail, but that is highly unlikely as it is one of the best platforms on polkadot. There is usually a small fee for pulling out liquidity in any liquid stake pool. It is usually a small amount, but if a bunch of people left at the same time that could lead to a large fee. I've never had an issue with it. Separate wallets with limited to no use is the perfect way to keep it safe without a ledger.

My recommendation, take a few dot, send it over to bifrost, and play with the platform.

"The reason you're not finding much information on these is that there's not much need for them, as Polkadot has better alternatives. From an end user perspective, both of these are useful for ""swapping tokens"" and there are better alternatives available.

Since all of the Polkadot parachains operate within the same consensus mechanism (i.e., the relay chain), there's not really a need for atomic swaps. From the perspective of consensus, sending DOT from the Asset Hub parachain to the Hydration parachain, for instance, is similar to sending DOT from one account to another on the same chain (there are technical differences, of course, but I mean in the ways that would matter to having an atomic swap). You don't need the extra overhead of an AS that comes with interacting between consensus mechanisms, since you only need to trust one consensus mechanism.

HTLCs in general are generally used in UTXO-based systems, not account-based systems like Polkadot (and most, if not all parachains also use account-based systems, although have been some attempts at UTXO-based parachains such as [Tuxedo](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/tuxedo_parachain.md)). If you \\*really\\* want to use a HTLC, you could write one in Solidity ([example](https://github.com/hgrano/eth-htlc)) and deploy to Moonbeam or another parachain which supports EVM.

Interlay, a parachain which interacts with the Bitcoin network (allowing you to trustlessly lock up Bitcoin and use it on Polkadot as Interlay-Bitcoin, or ""IBTC""), for instance, uses XCLAIM ([paper describing XCLAIM](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/643.pdf)). In this paper, they note ""We compare performance and costs to HTLC atomic swaps and show XCLAIM is 95.7% faster and 65.4% cheaper for 1000 swaps.""",r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEOHViUlBxeGJZMlA5NllaOXRtWGIzcDE0a2Z1YldWSWM5OC1NWmpHRXNxZ0tLMnR5Rl9HSDBzRUFaM0Y0bWlud244VWVBNEkxSlZ0WXV5ekZWMThFMGc9PQ==

1. Agile Coretime ([details](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-agile-coretime)) - Already on Kusama, coming soon to Polkadot (maybe next runtime upgrade, i.e., July sometime)

2. Async Backing ([details](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-async-backing)) - already live on Polkadot

3. Elastic Scaling ([details](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-elastic-scaling)) - Not deployed yet but a priority with the team, probably out within the next few months.

"solana is a shitcoin casino, thats not adoption imo, maybe it shows lotsa tx and activity but if in 1 month 450k tokens get launched while crypto after 16 years still has no niche then their is no real adoption, and 99.9% are scams or meme coins that try to steal money from idiots.

If you have put your pool into the ""destroying"" phase and all members, including yourself, have exited the pool, you should be able to withdraw your initial bond (the 500 DOT you mentioned). 

Here's how you can do it:

1. Navigate to the **Account Actions** (https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/staking/actions) page on the Polkadot.js UI.
2. Find the pool that is in the ""destroying"" phase and click the three dots on the right side of the pool row.

"Currently, Polkadot and Parachain use Substrate, which is a very flexible and extensible Blockchain SDK. It should be quite easy to disable cryptographic primitives vulnerable to quantum attacks and introduce those which are resistant. 

Afaik, quantum resistant crypto is expensive to execute which is why it is not the default choice today.

There are many ways we could program ownership claims of old accounts. This would be pretty dependent on the specific situation. We have already done things like this before allowing ETH accounts to claim their presale tokens directly to Polkadot accounts.

I think overall, the impact of quantum on Polkadot is similar or the same as any Blockchain today. However Polkadot stands out from the rest because it is designed to be upgradable and nimble with features like forkless upgrades. So it is, in my eyes, a chain that would have a better chance of surviving post quantum.",r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGSnhTNGloZFZnNXgtZTY3NW1aSFJieXZBXzEwX0dCV3lJNUM5TVA1aVpXdU1iN3lJOFhPbXJiUE9BX0pCLVpWODR2cmlhdF8xckZzRFZPNFBVOGM4U1E9PQ==

"Polkadot, like many other blockchain platforms, is aware of the potential threat posed by quantum computers to cryptographic security. Several general approaches are being considered in the blockchain community to mitigate this risk:

1. **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Polkadot can implement cryptographic algorithms that are resistant to quantum attacks. These algorithms are designed to be secure against the capabilities of quantum computers.

2. **Upgradeable Protocols**: Polkadot's architecture allows for on-chain governance and protocol upgrades. This flexibility means that Polkadot can incorporate new cryptographic standards as they are developed and tested.

3. **Research and Development**: The Web3 Foundation and other organizations involved in Polkadot are actively researching quantum-resistant technologies. They are preparing for potential future threats by staying at the forefront of cryptographic research.

It's also worth noting that the threat of quantum computers to blockchain systems is still largely theoretical, as practical quantum computers capable of breaking current cryptographic systems do not yet exist. However, Polkadot is actively researching and preparing for this potential future threat.",r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGVEVXaTl2ZVVFWUtqUEpMUld1dGFzc2EzTnhrYk9zX1pjdTAteWZnRkVqMkktQWVFVm5vVFlrUWw1MmE4WjYzMnlmWG1ZQVhtNkxGQk81NnFCTzNfNkE9PQ==

It's worth mentioning that almost every nomination pool won't auto-claim and compound rewards on behalf of the pool members, the Talisman pool is an exception in the sense we do claim & compound rewards on behalf of those wallets in the pool.

But it's not immune to fault - I've just double checked our auto-compounding method and it hasn't ran recently.

I have fixed the problem, and you should see rewards being claimed and compounded in your account soon :).",r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGOW91bmVMNEVFdWdfcXVmbnpGb2VCYXp0R3RLZmhGbXV6X3dsZzZyOFlhOFJEWkVZQ2FNWE42UDVhOTlHODhFV1V3VU9mVUpUb2NhakVrOFpzNHQ2VFE9PQ==

"Quick question. Does anyone know what manta is on change now (says manta network)? Is that pacific or Atlantic? And what form of manta (Atlantic or pacific) is the one supported by manta wallet? 

I tried to set up talisman wallet but for some reason it wouldn’t work. None of the other wallets supported by stellaswap seem to support manta but on the manta site itself I connected my manta wallet and my sub wallet and it looks like I can swap polkadot from my sub wallet for manta Atlantic (someone please correct me if I’m wrong) all I need is a manta Atlantic wallet address but I don’t know if manta wallet is Atlantic or pacific.

Maybe I can attach my sub wallet and swap DOT from there for manta Atlantic and send that to my nova wallet manta Atlantic address",r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGSHZ5aHh5MTZjWVk1SVFoaHJEQm94b0dONzFxVEFOZkJFQW5Qb1dtSUhCOU9URU0wZV9lWnNTLWU4Z3Q1MEJRZG1aYkQtOEpHV1BDVEZkOGljWTZWWXc9PQ==

"The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been running a multi-year project to standardize post-quantum cryptographic algorithms. They are currently in the final stages of this process, evaluating and selecting algorithms that will form the basis of new cryptographic standards designed to withstand quantum attacks. Some algorithms have already been selected for standardization, and NIST aims to finalize the process in the coming years.

https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography

Some of the notable types of post-quantum cryptography that are currently being studied include:

1. **Lattice-based cryptography**: Algorithms based on the hardness of lattice problems, such as Learning With Errors (LWE) and Ring-Learning With Errors (Ring-LWE).
2. **Hash-based cryptography**: Cryptographic methods that rely on the security of hash functions, such as the Merkle signature scheme.
3. **Code-based cryptography**: Cryptosystems based on error-correcting codes, like the McEliece cryptosystem.
4. **Multivariate polynomial cryptography**: Algorithms that use the hardness of solving systems of multivariate polynomial equations, such as the Unbalanced Oil and Vinegar (UOV) scheme.
5. **Isogeny-based cryptography**: Cryptographic methods based on the hardness of computing isogenies between elliptic curves, such as the Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) protocol.",r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHWjc0aUxCTF9va1pfdTd6TU1sSkYzODJRZnpqMU1WTWNtMG9CeFpXSVYwZTF4YXQ3RURNcmlvcDRyWmZLb0l3ZlRxNkhzekJ6MzlfTGVFYV9JZVViTFE9PQ==

As you might know, the Polkadot runtime and the Ledger app were updated yesterday. The new ""unified Polkadot app"" (v100.0.5) now supports signing any extrinsic on both Polkadot and Kusama networks, significantly enhancing the user experience. However, not all wallets have adapted to this change yet. I hope the Polkadot extension is updated soon. In the meantime, I recommend connecting your Ledger account to either Talisman or Subwallet, both of which are highly regarded by the community:
Talisman Wallet: How to Import a Ledger Account [1]
Subwallet: How to Import a Ledger Account [2]

I hope that helps!

"Because the app only supported the Relay Chain and then Kusama had an app, Astar had an app, etc. Everything was fragmented and some parachains weren't supported at all so you would be forced to use a hot wallet. Now there is one single app ecosystem wide that works with Polkadot, Kusama, their parachains, and chains built on Substrate. Now no matter what chain you are using you can secure your tokens on the Ledger hardware wallet. This adds a huge amount of security and makes everything far easier to use. You shouldn't need 50 applications on your Ledger for Polkadot and 49 other parachains. Most parachains don't even have a dedicated Ledger app. Now there is no more switching between apps, just one app to control them all.

The only thing you need the migration app for is to migrate your parachain balances to the new app. If all you are using is Polkadot (the relay chain) you can simply upgrade the application.",r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHVmdEbXZZRWM1TGRRY3o1WHVtVnJxeUxVWjFBQXlGbExXc3FEX2FpdmN3YzRSaVhKWkRSZ3NDd0g3aVFWbWRoaWEyakI4SERDWTRSeXJtNHRCRkNpVGc9PQ==

"I agree with this. X is a shit hole of communication these days, yes there is a large crypto community there- but it’s a pretty vapid one, most people are there to either (professionally) shill or scam. And more importantly, it’s advertising to an insular group of people- you’re not reaching new, larger addressable markets by focusing comms and advertising there. Same reason they plaster taxis with print ads in Berlin- it’s for the crypto bros living in the city. Circle jerking your product isn’t the way forward.

And heck, I don’t even think that Polkadot should be focused on retail adoption- if you’re actually a layer 0 you’re not the primary product, you’re the platform for products- money should be spent getting quality projects to build rather than growing the direct userbase for Dot. Building brand equity is fine, but part of that is building trust with the ecosystem. Where are jewels in the ecosystem that build that?

Yeah- I’m an active user but I hate OpenGov as a system of governance. We need individual oracles that have future intent and guide the network forward. Ethereum works because Vitalik and his dev team are exactly that- there is trust and consensus around governance and decisions.

"👀Main points from the speakers on the @Polkadot  treasury

@FabianGompf 

1. Different entities deploy capital in the Polkadot ecosystem, mainly the on-chain treasury and the foundation.
2. The foundation funds less noticeable projects, while the treasury should support more forward-thinking, attention-grabbing initiatives.
3. The treasury spends significant funds on critical infrastructure, but in recent months, it has spent too much on low-ROI activities.

@seunlanlege  

1. @Polkadot  is a developer platform and should invest heavily in developer grants, hackathons, and related initiatives.
2. Like NVIDIA, Polkadot should invest in developers and tools rather than sports sponsorships or other marketing activities.
3. Early funding for new and experimental projects is crucial because external investors are unlikely to support teams without initial backing.
4. Marketing should focus more on developers rather than retail users.

@giottodf 

1. Directly funding developers isn’t a good idea because it’s hard to assess which projects will succeed.
2. Marketing should showcase the openness of the Polkadot ecosystem to attract VCs to invest in developers.
3. The treasury is constantly replenished through inflation, so there’s no need to worry about running out of funds.
4. Marketing can create a wave of awareness that attracts VCs to invest in Polkadot projects.

@pambamdam 

1. Disagrees with Giotto because crypto VCs prefer investing in zero-to-one projects, not already public protocols.
2. Polkadot faces challenges in attracting VCs as a five-year-old protocol because VCs prefer early-stage investments.
3. The Polkadot treasury needs to fill the gap left by the ecosystem fund.

1. Different entities deploy capital in the Polkadot ecosystem, mainly the on-chain treasury and the foundation.
2. The foundation funds less noticeable projects, while the treasury should support more forward-thinking, attention-grabbing initiatives.
3. The treasury spends significant funds on critical infrastructure, but in recent months, it has spent too much on low-ROI activities.

Ok so I know I must sound like a dope at this point but I’ve linked a sub wallet to the manta exchange (app.manta.network) and I funded it with polkadot (DOT). When I go to the bridge/swap function page I can choose to swap polkadot to Manta Atlantic and then below that I can type in how much DOT I want to swap but then it gives me nowhere to put in a manta Atlantic destination address and no way to complete the transaction. What is going on here? How can I get this done?

"At first glance, the size of the payments wasted on ineffective marketing and influencer payouts suggest incompetence. However, I think the true state of affairs is much worse - this has all the hallmarks of a ‘soft-rug’ - meaning, insiders are taking money out of the project via the treasury, which they are either pocketing for themselves or ‘yolo’ spending on personal items/personal expenses like cars, watches holidays and the latest drip to flex on socials and are logging these payments as ‘mArKeTiNg eXpenSes’. This slow financial attrition is how DOT becomes the next EOS. 

Furthermore, the fact that DOT paid $200k to put the logo on private jets in Europe suggests that the project insiders are looking for exit liquidity from high net worth individuals. 

Some of these ‘marketing expenses’ probably also included money Gavin took for himself to cover the costs of his hair transplant - lol.

Ladies and gentlemen, the DOT/BTC chart doesn’t lie.

Polkaflop is doing all the right things for an epic short in the bear market of 2025-2026. We just need it to pump with the rest of the market to come into a premium so that shorts can be built at higher prices. This is how bag holders can get their money back and give the middle finger to the DOT insiders/large whales who in combination with poor tokenomic design have kept you all under water. 

Get out of this at break even if you can - this isn’t taking out its ATH.

"I don’t think that there is necessarily bad intent from most of the main dev team, the issue is the amount of financial success too early relative to what is being built imo. That inherently makes people lazy and takes away some of the hustle culture that’s really important for early stage projects. Ego can also take hold and people lose sight of the bigger picture (or get caught in it).

There’s definitely too much spending on conference junkets etc although those are things that should still take priority over 95% of the consumer facing promotion which is redundant for Dot in this stage of its lifecycle. 

And if I’m ultra critical things like the JAM release (videography etc) smell a little bit like vanity projects to me although I’d rather that than shitty YouTube influencers (where the bulk of things are seemingly going). 

Ultimately the hour on stage with Vitalik the other week (talking about JAM to a larger dev audience) was more meaningful than a year of promo and that pretty cinematic black and white video with a beer in hand. 

Anyway- the rest of the wastage that you point out is inexcusable. Tons of bad actors amongst large token holders too- it makes for an environment of ‘extraction’ as opposed to building.

"It lets me choose from DOT, moon, pacific, Atlantic etc. and I choose to swap from DOT to Atlantic. When I choose DOT it shows my DOT balance as long as I have it connected to my sub wallet instead of my manta wallet (I bought the DOT from coinbase through sub wallet). Even when I do this though however it doesn’t give me a place to enter a destination wallet for the Atlantic nor any way to complete the transaction.

I managed to swap some of my DOT from sub wallet to manta pacific via change now and sent the pacific to my manta pacific wallet in manta wallet, however when I connect to my manta wallet (instead of sub wallet) on the manta network bridge/swap page  and then choose to swap pacific for Atlantic it gives me a place to enter a destination Atlantic wallet address but it says I have zero balance in my manta pacific, which is obviously incorrect, making me still unable to complete the transaction.

"Tbh I’ve never really cared about short term charts, I bought at ICO (29c) sold 80% at 21/22 peak (when it was completely overvalued imo) and the rest I’ll hold for another 5 years or so- at this point its basically a binary bet. And fwiw I hold magnitudes more BTC and ETH so DOT is really just pure capital risk. 

And in terms of this cycle- I have a different opinion to most, I don’t believe that most altcoins will ever see ATH’s again, and I don’t think that this cycle will see much more growth outside of BTC and ETH. I think we’re at a different point in the lifecycle of crypto as a whole, its completely saturated with too many large market caps and not enough liquidity- and it’s very much ‘prove it or lose it’ time. 

But I also don’t think it’s a sprint, there’s probably a 5 year window now where people either develop or die, Dot is one of the few with a large kitty to keep going so I’m not counting it out.

You dont need to enter an Atlantic wallet because your DOT wallet and MANTA wallet share the same generic Polkadot address. This may be a shocker, but this is the beauty of Polkadot and its interoperability.  

I would test out sending a small amount of DOT.  I don’t use sub wallet, but Talisman will show you all of your holdings on all of the chains.  Like if I click on my Polkadot holdings it breaks out my DOT on ASTR, MANTA, HDX etc.

Edit:  As for the pacific to Atlantic portion where you are not seeing a balance… I’m not sure about that portion.  I’ve swapped MANTA pacific to Atlantic with no issues.  I don’t think you can swap DOT using that UI.

One part that’s still a problem though is when I try to swap DOT for Atlantic it shows my DOT balance and it allows me to manually enter an amount of DOT that I want to swap but it doesn’t do anything when I type in the amount.

"So in your argument, it worked. Without the substance, Ignas couldn’t generate that content. Gud job by him.

These are growing pains of Polkadot’s governance and managing decentralized marketing as it has never tried before, but at least it is transparent. 

Why do you think these influencers are asking for such high costs and why projects are feeling dependent on them? 

I hope you weren’t naive to think that any other chain does nothing. No, you just don’t see and know about it.

We learn through via-negativa.  Unfortunately, for progress, projects like Polkadot have to pay the high cost today until competition and better options arrive, and that part has just begun. But without the worst parts, today wouldn’t come.

As for the FUD, ride with it. Being talked about is still better than being irrelevant. And with its FUD, there is a silver lining that shows the power of OpenGov and its uniqueness. Now expect some better marketers and business development approaches to Polkadot.

Also, just to confirm, I don’t use the manta network bridge I use Stella swap instead? So I can send my DOT for Atlantic through Stella swap and then send the Atlantic to my manta Atlantic wallet from Stella swap just like when I swap using changenow (for different coins of course)?

"Think of Polkadot as a solar system with a bunch of different planets (chains).  Each planet can utilize most of the other planets assets. In order to send them to another planet you need to use cross-chain messaging.  


1.  The Manta on Stellaswap is Moonbeam Manta (on the moonbeam chain).  After swapping for Manta there, you can use the bridge function to transfer from moonbeam to Manta chain (Atlantic):

[https://app.manta.network/manta/bridge](https://app.manta.network/manta/bridge)

2. You can use the XCM function on Stellaswap as well, but I just tried it and for some reason it was being buggy.  The Manta dApp bridge is working great.

3. I would use the Manta dApp bridge to send Pacific to Atlantic as well.

  
I use Talisman wallet for this and haven't branched out to any others. but Subwallet should be fine.  Just know that Moonbeam and Pacific use the EVM side of the wallet (Ethereum based address) while Atlantic uses the Polkadot side.  

Also, I was having issues getting my DOT onto stellaswap using the bridge (native XCM) function.  It may be because Talisman wallet just had a large upgrade.

Spending money on sports teams/influencers/taxis is just poor use of advertising money relative to the addressable market that you’re trying to reach. Real value is investment in the development of the protocols that are being built on top of Dot, and actually bringing to fruition the kinds of interoperable killer products (as Dot so loudly promised) that are actually going to bring consumers on board.

"Thanks a ton!

Ok, so I’m on stellaswap now, I went to the regular swap page and put in swap from DOT (native DOT/DOT.Xc) and swap to the only Manta they had (manta.xc). Is this correct? And also, a bigger issue I’m having is that I have connected my sub wallet to Stella swap and my sub wallet has several DOT in it but when I type in the swap on the swap page it says I have zero balance of DOT and tells me I have insufficient funds when I try to submit the swap. I clicked on the wallet address in the upper right hand corner and it doesn’t match my sub wallet DOT address. Is that a receiving wallet address instead in the upper right corner? Do I need to send DOT from sub wallet to Stella swap first before I can do the swap ? (On change now I always send the coin I’m swapping after I submit the swap). Also, if that’s the case then what’s the point of connecting my sub wallet beforehand if I have to manually send the DOT anyway? Plus the wallet address in the upper right corner on Stella swap starts with Ox and my DOT wallet address in sub wallet starts with 1x so is the wallet address on Stella swap even a DOT wallet at all (it starts differently)? I don’t want to send my funds to an invalid wallet. 

Also, where do I sent the manta.xc when I do get it? Does it automatically go to my connected wallet (in this case sub wallet)? Does sub wallet support the manta.xc (moonbeam manta) version of manta? 

I’m sorry for all these questions, I think we’re almost there and can this done today (finally lol). It’s just these things I like to triple check because they kinda confuse me and I’ve heard the horror stories of people’s money disappearing because of one wrong step (it actually happened to me personally once already trying to get this mantra Atlantic coin).

As always, much appreciated!

"Awesome! Thanks. Ok so I’ve got two issues going on now (I know it never ends) but I have gotten further than I’ve gotten before though so that’s something.

First, I swapped some DOT for manta pacific through change now and sent it to my evm sub wallet and I also used the link you sent me to swap some more DOT for DOT.xc and sent that to my evm sub wallet as well. So now I’ve got a balance of both of those (manta pacific and DOT.xc) in my evm sub wallet. So I should be able to swap them both for manta Atlantic (manta pacific through manta bridge and DOT.xc by swapping for manta.xc on stellaswap and then swapping that (as moonbeam) for Atlantic through the manta bridge) correct? 

Now here’s my problems: first, when I try to swap the manta pacific in my evm sub wallet for manta Atlantic in the manta bridge  I click get address and my polkadot sub wallet’s manta Atlantic address comes up and it shows my manta pacific balance so I enter an amount and the button on the bottom (approve manta) lights up so I click it and it gives that loading wheel for a second and then just stops. Everything looks right and it even lets me click the submit button but it doesn’t go through. It just loads for a second and then stops. 

Second issue: when I try to swap DOT.xc for manta.xc on stellaswap again I connect my SubWallet evm and my DOT.xc balance shows up but no matter how much or how little DOT.xc I enter for the amount when I click the submit button at the bottom it always tells me insufficient funds even though I have plenty of DOT.xc. (And it’s showing up in my available balance as well).

Any idea what’s going on with these 2 issues? I think once I get past these I might be home free because I think both of those swapped for Atlantic on the manta bridge will put all of the manta Atlantic in my manta Atlantic section of the polkadot side of my sub wallet and then I can send it from there to my manta Atlantic section of my nova wallet where I want to stake it.

"Thanks! Ok so I swapped some for GLMR and got the swap completed from DOT.xc to manta.xc so now I got a balance of both manta pacific and manta.xc in my evm sub wallet (finally! lol). 

The only issues now are the other issue I was having before. It’s now happening for both coins, manta pacific as well as manta.xc (as moonbeam). 

When I attempt to swap manta pacific from my evm SubWallet to Manta Atlantic (going to my polkadot side of SubWallet) it allows me to enter everything properly and it allows me to click the submit button at the bottom but then all that happens is the cursor does this like loading image for a few seconds (actually it turns into a spinning circle with a red line through it, like a no smoking sign) and then just stops and nothing more happens. The transaction never happens. Even though everything looks correct.

Second, when I attempt to swap moonbeam (it allows me to choose GLMR or manta under moonbeam so I choose manta for my manta.xc) something similar happens. It allows me to enter everything properly and everything looks correct and legit but this time the submit button at the bottom is dim/not lit up and it’s not clickable, as if I’ve done something invalid even though everything looks perfect.

So those 2 issues are the only 2 blocking me right now from getting this done (and I think once I get past these issues I’ll finally have the Atlantic in my SubWallet and will be able to send it where I need it).

"DOT will be like ETH or SOL on steroids (in my opinion) once JAM is released, bringing Polkadot and the DOT token to another level: [https://youtu.be/c95NUsWjaiI?si=AWCaFD1xzixuulBw](https://youtu.be/c95NUsWjaiI?si=AWCaFD1xzixuulBw).

Right now, DOT is only used for four main functions:

1. **Governance**: DOT holders have the right to participate in the governance of the Polkadot network. This includes voting on protocol upgrades, changes, and the allocation of network resources.

2. **Staking**: DOT is used for staking in the Polkadot network’s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. By staking DOT, users can become validators or nominate validators, helping to secure the network. In return, they earn rewards.

3. **Bonding**: DOT is used to connect new parachains (individual blockchains within the Polkadot network) through a process called bonding. This helps ensure that only valid and valuable parachains are added to the network.

4. **Fees**: DOT is used to pay for transaction fees and computational operations on the Polkadot network, ensuring that users contribute to the cost of maintaining the network.

Polkadot doesn't run smart contracts (DApps) directly on-chain like Ethereum or Solana. This is all going to change once JAM is released.

If you have half an hour to spare, I highly recommend listening to the latest interview Gavin did about JAM on The Kusamarian. He lays out the case far better than anybody else: [https://youtu.be/pCPD2A4dM3c?si=Za_9VRMGBUyoFZQo](https://youtu.be/pCPD2A4dM3c?si=Za_9VRMGBUyoFZQo).",r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPZjdMRkZGRTZYYXpHeUM4NDZacW8waUxMdFMwV3dyZkRaUXFITzZsSWRrSzduZHFua3Q2ajFxLVJrM1E5dGs1Z1JyMVotU0JRcHBRMUJGR1ZrRjZ4THc9PQ==

Nothing changes with staking on Polkadot 2.0. Staking only will change through governance. If any referendums come up that will change the nature of staking I will certainly post here about it.

"It might sound trite, but you can pick and choose what you listen to. It's actually worth the effort to tune out some of the dross.

Because Polkadot is a relatively self contained and slightly inwards facing ecosystem, there tends to be over-amplication of noisier voices and personality drama. People get stuck in that bubble. But when you dig into the related / specific detail, nine times out of 10 it turns out that the drama is mostly manufactured posturing, and the 'evidence' is edge case type stuff puffed up and presented as ubiquitous - ie a lot of bollocks being talked. And of course the usual social media bad faith ad hominem attacks and so forth happens around the edges too.

Tl;Dr - find a couple of info sources you can trust and glean factual updates from - Kusamarian fits the bull on that front - and ignore the social posturing. 

When truism type accusations are made, it's usually worth finding out the detail for yourself; start by presuming that the majority of opinions being expressed are rooted in repetition without much substance.

I've found that a useful approach anyway.

"The reason why Polkadot Treasury Proposal submitters hold minimal DOT amounts in their linked accounts may be related to the concept of the Existential Deposit (ED). The ED is the minimum amount of DOT that an account must hold to be active on the blockchain. The current ED is set at 1 DOT. 

When a user submits a proposal, they are required to make a deposit. The deposit is returned if the proposal is approved. If the proposal is rejected, the deposit is burned.

"Are you using parachains? Polkadot has defi as well. The people who are only staking are new and not used to cross chain and dealing with multiple wallet addresses. I use moonbeam, bifrost, astar, acala, hydra dx, and stellaswap regularly. It takes time to learn new crypto. Polkadot mainnet went live in 2020. Parachains didn't start up until 2021. I'd say for a crypto that has only been running for a few years worth billions. It's doing fine.  But you are correct, this is an attention seeking market.

SocialFi is interesting. I could see that taking off in the future. I'm not fully sold on GameFi. We need game studios to take more interest. Most of the crypto games are not good. And a lot of the gaming devs are not that interested in migrating out of their environments. This is actually an issue even for the concept of web3 and blockchains too. Companies have to be interested in making the swap. I work in IT for a large logistics company and none of the execs know anything about crypto. They have 0 interest in it. We have to make the offer so cheap that every corperation on the planet would want to make the swap. It is a numbers game. We have to beat AWS and Azure and other tech services like that. And our infrastructure for crypto uses those services too. We have maaaaaany years ahead of us before major adoption happens. It is a slow burn, but younger generations will take notice. And our youth can help shape that change over time. Major investment groups will start eating up other crypto over the next decade with multiple etfs being launched.

"The real Polkadot origin story is probably only truly known by the people that were ""in the room"" at the time.

But the story goes like this:

In late 2015, Ethereum Foundation was thinking of multiple ways in which to become more efficient, including its switch to PoS, and Gavin was proposing a sharded model approach in order to scale horizontally, something that the Ethereum dev community at the time was not for.  Seeing that he was the one that implemented the first version of Ethereum and created the first version of EVM and Solidity language, Gavin said to himself ""if I implemented someone's else idea (aka Vitalik's), why not try to do that with my own idea via Parity"" \\[*note: Parity was an already existing company that created one of the OG Ethereum alternative clients in Rust, before moving to create Substrate, also known as Polkadot SDK, and then Polkadot and Kusama, in that order*\\]

Anyway... that's how the story goes, or some shit like that (again nobody really knows except the people behind it, but you're asking this question on reddit and that's all I got for u).

You were correct that the entire purpose of the Inter Miami FC deal is to attach ourselves somehow with Messi in the hopes that would bring adoption to Polkadot (a very big assumption that doesn't have a great plan behind it, in my opinion, but I digress).

But this almost means nothing if there is a huge mental barrier that prevents them from understanding that this is real. So we decided to solve this issue.""

"Issue: Coordination of wallet voting in order to deplete Treasury of DOT funds

How can you investigate and help:  Make public the investigation and discovery of user pattern behavior, DV vote behavior and OpenGov vote sniping (there's clear evidence of this, someone just needs to look at it)

What tools do you have at your disposal:  On-chain data (you need nothing besides subscan data to actually demonstrate vote sniping), social/forum data (part of user behavior, DV voting behavior, etc), external data (unreliable, but can add context to the investigation)

Perform an analysis and projection of the ecosystem risks if the respective ""scam"" behavior is allowed to continue, present it to the community.  No bias, no prejudice, just data.

Conclusion:  Then you can call yourself Anti-Scam Ecosystem Agent.  Until then, you're just Anti-Phishing Ecosystem Agent (with a ticketing system, and that blacklists URLs)

"The biggest scam so far is Equilibrium Finance

In January, I transferred a significant amount of DOT to the Equilibrium Finance chain. During that time, I had read quite a bit about the project and wanted to give it a try. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of not checking the leasing period. So, I send my DOT to the chain, and a pop-up appears, stating that their in-house EQ token can be exchanged for the new Q token. I browse the site a bit more and get myself some EQ and Q tokens. Then I go to bed.

The next day, I want to continue and try some transactions. Nothing goes onto the chain or off of it. I go to the EQ Finance Discord channel and ask around. There, I find out that the lease period ended today. This means the chain has been halted. I ask why it is possible to implement a pop-up on the site informing about a token swap, but a pop-up with a warning about an impending chain halt is not placed. No answer to this question. I get the feeling they don't care about user funds here for the first time.

The responses I've been getting for months are always the same: Please be patient. All funds are safu. Don't worry. We are still working on the project...  
How am I supposed to stay calm? It has now been half a year, and in the past few months, EQ Finance hasn't even applied for a slot as a parachain?! Other chains have swapped slots with other parachains to remain functional during this time. EQ Finance doesn't even consider it necessary to provide any updates.

Please help us. Many are desperate and just want to get their DOT back.

"A good reason to join Polkadot is the endless drama related to bad actors who join forces to steal from the treasury. 


For instance, the large amount of money spent on fake marketing campaigns:

A random invoice (INV071.pdf) from the Google drive gathering marketing expenses receipts shows a $257k bill from a company called ""Elite Dreamer Co. LTD."".

"Derivation paths are like a set of instructions that tell your wallet how to generate and find your keys and addresses.

Here's a simple way to understand it:

1. **Master Key**: When you create a wallet, a master key is generated from a seed phrase (a series of words you need to write down and keep safe).

2. **Branches of a Tree**: Think of the master key as the trunk of a tree. The derivation path is like a set of directions to specific branches and leaves on that tree. Each branch or leaf represents a different key or address where you can store cryptocurrency.

3. **Consistent Paths**: By using the same derivation path, you can consistently find the same keys and addresses across different wallets or devices. This ensures you can always access your funds as long as you have your seed phrase and follow the same path.

4. **Path Structure**: A typical derivation path looks something like this: `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0`. Each number and symbol represents a different branch level. For example:
   - `m` is the master key.
   - `44'` might represent a specific purpose.
   - `60'` could represent a specific coin type.
   - And so on, until you get to a specific key.

So basically, derivation paths help your wallet organized and access the many keys and addresses that can be generated from a single seed phrase.",r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYRFNBR0VSeXpsRnBWMExiZXFvNS1xTXo3THZ2M3ctbEhjWkxCeHVlWXZJVGJZYVVIZGJOYzJod0p1Z1NhN2NtTGZoeFBiQ2NXaVJjWEVlZG9WRmM0Smc9PQ==

Will assess once both are released and I get the chance to use them. I will say that I absolutely love Nova Wallet and having a MasterCard debit card tied to it is my dream come true.

"I will test both, but until they are actually released I will have to wait and see which one works out better.   Polkadot Pay seems a better option at first glance, since it seems to be working through a gift card approach with a 20% cash back option and no KYC.  The Nova Debit Card is harder to assess, as it is unclear to me if this would mandate KYC to obtain.  I am hoping a DID (Decentralized ID) would be an option to obtain a Nova Debit Card, which is tolerable for my use case instead of KYC (which is always a deal breaker for me with any chain or appchain).

In any event, these are great additions to the Polkadot DAO mothership and I can't wait to read the fine print.",r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaSWIwc283aEE2OFVCYWFkYzNYNHh5MFdmSGpDWFkxNmJlMGlxMDEwLU9ibzJQdjk1UWxrY1FNb2l6a0h4MEpzeVJRNjFtM2JBczRIcGFPUW1sMlV0bHc9PQ==

"Granted the tech is great, imagine how it will be in 5 years time !

And not even with that in mind, what about now? For me it's:

Electricity bills = pad monthly paid with DOT

Gas bills = paid monthly paid with DOT

University degree - paid with DOT

Luxury fun stuff - splashing out on nice clothes/ iPhone / Apple Watch  = paid by DOT.

And not a dent in my actually savings, dot principal holdings, salary or emergency funds. It just keeps on replenishing. Consistently, every single day !

Even though I re-stake, compound, and re-invest I still manage to cream off a few dot here and there just for the luxury. SO the project is good as a living investment now, as well as the future.

It always feels good to take a little profit. And unlike ETH, when you do want to cash out $45 or something .. it's PEANUTS in fees. Try doing that in ETH or bitcoin - a fourth of that will come out in fees.

So If this project's like this now (when market adoption is low), wait until Polkadot  2.0 arrives, with mass adoption - not to mention  Polkadot ETF around the corner (Institutional money).

Institutions invest because there's a tried and tested and profitable asset.

If you're thinking selling now - do so. Don't bat an eyelid.

Bit if you're serious - try to look at polkadot from a longterm perspective - invest steadily with the same longterm timeframe and effort as you do investing in your pension, it will pay for itself when you retire. And if you keep steadily investing a small amount in this asset class, along with your normal fiat stocks and shares investments, you could probably live off this alone - in the future, you won't even need to touch your pension, 401k or savings.",r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMTRsdWI0ZE02TE9Gc29PYm9ZM1Z5eE5YbEktRFBaUmdIZWh3ZV9fT3hJWXNRRDRVSVlYVEtLTkUxcVRvd0RrY3kzTWY2QUYxc0I0UkxhX0oxckZ5TVE9PQ==
