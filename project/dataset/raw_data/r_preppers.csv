"Well there’s no better way to start than to start and you should begin with - food, water, and shelter. Build up a stockpile of food items that can last at least 3-6 months or longer like canned goods, dried beans, rice, pasta, peanut butter, powdered milk etc AND rotate through your stockpile so nothing expires.

Water is next, have at least a few gallons per person per day on hand, plus a way to purify additional water if needed. Look into getting a water storage system or large containers you can fill up. [50 Doomsday Apocalypse Survival Items](https://alaskanarrows.com/50-doomsday-apocalypse-survival-items/) can help with some other items too

ALSO make sure your home is in good shape and you have the necessary supplies like tarps, rope, duct tape, etc. in case you need to do any repairs or create makeshift shelters. 

If you have a budget maybe invest in a generator? 

Think about other essentials like first aid kits, hygiene items, warm clothing, and any medications you rely on. It's also smart to have some cash on hand in case ATMs and banks are inaccessible.

Don't try to do everything at once and get your whole  family involved so everyone knows where things are and how to use them! really important

"Buy 10 bics and put one in every coat and bag you use regularly.

Also the hardest part about fire building in the field is foraging DRY fuel, kindling and tinder.

So learning where to look for dry combustibles is key. 

Pine trees are your best friend. 

Check around the base of the trunk for well protected dry dead branches. 

Scrape some resin or tap some resin in a long term situation. 

Check inside fallen logs or standing dead trees for dry punky wood.

I haven't had a problem with them and have not received any lemons. Each time I've contacted support they've been responsive. I like the ease and flexibility with the Ecoflows as they can charge very quickly off AC power and seem to hold charges reliably.

The irony is, I'm one of the few preppers who did indeed move out of the US and I live somewhere that is very insulated from a western civ crash.

"I live in a 3rd floor apartment, gets the sun the full length sunrise to 130ish. I have bubble wrap on my plant windows and white foamboard( dollartree) inserts made to go in the rest. The white makes it fine for the rule of white backed curtains. It helps black out rooms too. I do 3 per windows so on nice days you can move to just one and have light come in. It takes one and a half for one insert for my windows, the amount it cuts of heat coming in for 5 sheets bought per window is amazing. Leave the paper on, they last much longer. But I have bought any color and removed the paper to light coming through foam that still blocks the cold and heat.

on these 100f days, even keeping the ac set to 72 by the evening it 78f plus. Two old menopausal women still getting hot flashes. I sleep with the fan in the window when it's 50 out at night. Summers suck for me.

Lost power for 20 hours only last year and felt how bad it could get on 89f days, I will be making these cool packs, I will link the video, made with table salt and sodium sulfate and Xanthan Gum. They stay 65f for hours, recool/recharge on a cool basement floor if no power or the car ac. I plan to fill gallon size storage bags, tape them closed and tape some together that can fold fan like to hold to the body. I am at the point thinking everyone needs these even just to save gas on ac. 

  
We need to push these complexes to also use thermal paints to reduce heat coming in. I get the sun , rise to 130is, it gets hot starting with the sunrise, I wake up from the heating of it coming in.

Good luck and i know how it feels being very low income and trying to prep as best as you can.

"The box fan copper wire (I assume with the copper pipe running through an ice chest with a circulator pump) is useless. Central air conditioners are sized by tons, like a 1 ton unit, 2 ton unit, etc. 

Nowadays that links to BTUs, but the old meaning of tonnage is the amount of heat needed to melt one ton of ice in 24 hours is what a one-ton unit can cool, etc. 

If you're talking about an ice chest, that's nowhere close to a ton, so pretty quickly the ice is going to melt and warm up. You'll get something out of it in the immediate area, but you won't cool the room and you'll be replacing the ice very frequently.

There will also be a ton of condensation dripping off of the copper coil if it is very humid out.

One more idea...a ""swamp cooler"" is a fan that forces air through a wet surface with lots of surface area. The water evaporates, and the energy that is absorbed during that process cools the air. This only works in relatively low humidity environments.

"I agree that being a refugee is a horrible outcome, and the idea of cities needing to empty out because no food is coming in is, in the US, fanciful. You'd need a complete infrastructure collapse, US wide, to cause it. (But cities would run out of food in less than a week - yay, Just In Time stockpiling systems - and most people would figure out real quick that they have to leave. Fragile systems break down fast.)

IF it happened, though? Urban areas hold 80% of the US population. Even if half died, the flood of people would overwhelm rural areas with a 2:1 advantage in manpower, and with just as many guns. It would be a horrific, violent mess with absurd numbers of death in both populations. That's the end of the US, right there.

I've seen people living in conditions the US cannot even imagine - I did one trip to Haiti, my wife did eight (and she was there when the 2010 earthquake hit).

In long lasting medium disturbance scenario, you may even be less safe in a remote area.

"Lithium? 

Lithium batteries self-discharge very very slowly. Say in the range of 5% a year, something like that. I'm making up a number, but I've had LiPo batteries at storage voltage in the fridge, and after several years they were basically still at the original voltage. 

But if you're talking about like a power station, that also depends on whether the electronics have any very-small drain on the battery itself. 

Lithium batteries don't like being stored fully-charged, and they don't like deep discharges. I would store them around 60% charged. If there's no parasitic drain on the batteries from the electronics, you could probably just briefly add some charge once a year or something like that.

"Sewers, for the most part, depend on gravity and natural slope, so they just keep working. That said, some parts of your town may require additional lift pumps due to unfavorable geography. These pumps almost always have backup power, but that power only lasts a couple of days.

If you're the guy on top of the hill, this is probably not a concern, but if you're in a lower spot near the lift pump, it might suck.

"In my opinion prepping needs to happen in a very specific order. The most likely emergency is not an end of the world event, it is a personal loss of income from losing your job or becoming injured and being unable to work. Having your finances in order first would be the best prep you could do at any budget. This is the order I took to ""prepping""

* Getting current on all bills and save up an emergency fund of 3-6 months of expenses  
* Make emergency kits. Basically 72 hour kits. After a loss of income, the most likely emergency is a power outage or vehicle break down. Keep enough supplies in your house to be clothed, fed, and hydrated for 3 days. Keep emergency supplies in your car. 
* Become physically fit. Keeping your health under control can help prevent a lot of emergencies in your regular life, pre apocalypse.

Air compressor, the PSI of trailer tires is high those little junk in an emergency things are nearly useless for them.  Their are some expensive ones for your tow vehicle either belt driven or 12v.  AC if you have it is far cheaper and fast a small pancake compressor.

IR Thermometer, useful diagnostic tires get hot then they fail similar for breaks.

Inverter/lifepo4/solar, AC is just really useful.  Air compressor as stated earlier.  Can run AC while driving down the road.  Run fridge while driving (propane can be an issue and few are 3 way anymore), now even better get a 12v compressor fridge or upgrade existing.

"First off never get a black box package.

Lifepo4 the prefered battery chemistry for this loses 1-2% of capacity a month and is recommended to store between 20-80% so you shouldn't be put them away topped up so to speak. This chemistry is rated for about 10 years and that's being used pretty hard 2k or more cycles a nicer DoD and not charging to 100% some are rated to 10k cycles.

The how you do that depends on what gear your using.  My Victron kit I tell to keep at 80% charge unless there is NWS alert for my area.  They should be exercised as well don't let them site for years rather have them discharge down and fully recharge a few times a year again this can be handled in the management system.

Put it all together you leave a load connected say your freezer in the garage the system will sit at 80% until a weather alert.  If it's not done a discharge/recharge cycle for 90 days it will run one.  Since it can work with the solar you even save money day to day.

My 7 Year old setup in my camper is still 98% of original capacity, it's the oldest setup I still have.

"Obviously people make different decisions on how closely they follow indoor and outdoor stove recommendations. Having prepped in a small apartment for a long time, I felt fire risk and carbon monoxide were significant threats especially in an emergency so I made pretty conservative (ie safe) decisions. 

I bought a butane stove rated for indoor use and stored 6 butane canisters. They let you use high and low heat somewhat like a regular stove. The camping stoves are not generally rated for indoor use. The primary fuel I stored were the sterno-type jelled alcohol and a bottle of denatured alcohol.  These have a very long shelf life and are not under pressure so much safer to store inside. I also had an alcohol burner for camping. I’d experimented with the best set up for cooking and providing heat. 

There is now a cooker/heater called the “vesta” that is pretty clever and can be used as a stove or a heater that blows the hot air toward you without additional power. I’ve never tried this personally since I now live in a house w a wood stove. If I had stayed in my apartment I probably would have bought one. Many people recommend the big buddy which uses propane canisters (or a larger tank). Some states rate it for indoor use some don’t. I was never comfortable storing propane inside my home. 

Whatever you decide, it’s important to have airflow with any flame, a fire extinguisher, and carbon monoxide alarm, get a battery operated digital one so you can see the level of CO not just once it goes over the safe limit. I also kept a fire blanket handy in my kitchen. If you catch a fire quickly, it can be smothered without spraying foam etc all over the place.",r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZbUtQbnhGai1mRlBSRl9kblRSaVl6UURjM0FhR2Fhc0lwcjh0TkZBUHBaTDNpQUxnTGg1LUk5MG42YWx2QjdtSk4wM2pHcVFka180MElCOXVUdHZ2RHppTk1yZDhZYzRNWlM3RWprR2RwNDQ9

"If they are talking about a Hi-Lift I'm sure there are a billion videos.

They're also really damn dangerous even if you're careful. 

Anyway... The main things are jacking up the vehicle and they can lift a lot higher than any other jack which is why off road guys use em.

They can also be used as a mechanical winch.

If you jack up the front or back and you push your vehicle sideways while it is up, the jack will tip over and move the lifted end of the vehicle over slightly. Which is dangerous as hell but useful if you plan and are lucky.

They're super unstable so it is easy to push the vehicle in any direction causing the jack to tip if you're not careful. It can tip into the body causing damage.

"If you are critically dependent on having an axe to split firewood or whatever, then my best advice would be to have a pair, instead of trying to find one that's guaranteed unbreakable.

Composite handles from reputable manufacturers should be more durable than wood. But I actually don't think this advice from another poster is sound:

> But if you do, throw it in a fire to burn off the broken part and replace it with an ash or willow handle.

Composite axes often have a handle overmolded over a solid head. This is not going to be easy to retrofit onto a wooden handle:

"I found out something else too since I wrote this morning. Happy Goose Bay area is also on fire. So one of the solutions to this is to get away by boat. NL has thousands of lakes and a maze of water ways. Most people have boats there and skidoos for winter.  Cycling would not be realistic in that situation and you would be better off if you were trapped to move out of the way in a boat. The smoke would still be a problem but you would have a better chance of surviving on water than on shore if you had only one road in and out and fire coming at you from both directions. It's not a fun situation and our prayers are with those people that are dealing with this.

the other thing to consider is the distance and the amount of fuel it takes. I think there are one or two service stations open during the summer. They use the skidoos and I would assume CATs in winter to travel so they would have to have fuel for those vehicles. But can those stations supply all of Labrador city? I don't know How that situation would be. It was a problem with the FT. Mac evacuation a couple years ago. 

The other way is by air which would probably go to St. John NL. evac by air would mean taking very few things with you and would be extremely expensive since you would have to rely on store bought food instead of locally foraged or fished. I think a gallon of milk is something like $20 there. ( not sure since the prices went up over 100% this year)

"First, potassium iodide tablets aren't used for fallout. That's a common misconception. They are used for other nuclear scenarios. And taking them at the wrong time can lead to health problems.

Second, while fallout is happening you shelter in place, but even with that I'd want more than 4 N95 masks. You'll want to change them pretty often or they will simply trap radioactive material near your face. Better than in your lungs, but still maybe not great. 

Water purification tablets don't make sense here. Store clean water that lasts you at least a week or three instead. Don't try drinking out of puddles or streams in a nuclear war, even if you do have radiological filters. It is not worth the risk.

Overall, I don't know exactly what you're preparing for here. Your food is elsewhere, you say. Ok, so what is this box of stuff for? Not travelling. You won't be doing that. Most of these supplies won't last you more than a week. Nuclear war is likely to involve multiple waves of strikes, with the potential for continued fallout for days, followed by a at least a 3 day cooldown period if not more. I'd plan on a month at home to be sure. 

And it's probably worth mentioning that if it goes to full escalation, the US crashes as a nation and you aren't really prepped for that; very few people are.

"I have a couple Fiskars axes and have had them for a couple years. They’re pretty durable, I split my wood, my neighbors, and my relatives cause I enjoy it and let me tell ya that thing will take some abuse. That being said, mine isn’t the best for harder woods if they’re sizable logs because it’s not all that heavy, but for any small piece or softwood it’s perfect. Decent enough steel, keeps an edge for a while, and they all feel good in the hand. That being said, I have both more composite  and wood axes, but I also collect axes so that might be irrelevant as well. 

I think it kind of depends on what job the tool is doing and what you’re used to. I honestly don’t think I could accidentally break my fiberglass/composite tools that have some quality to them. The cheap ones are a different story, but don’t buy bad quality fiberglass handles, if you’ve ever had broken fiberglass in your skin you know that’s torture. 

Also if you’re worried, know how to cut a new handle and how to put a head on there. Or just buy some extras, but making your own is a decent project and enjoyable, plus it gives you something much more valuable: skills. I recommend making some handles, just try it out, don’t just read how to do it. I’d watch a video, buy some cheap wood and try some handles, then once you get a decent handle get some nicer wood.

I checked the ""best by"" dates on various brands of dog food at the local Walmart and all of them were Nov & Dec 2025.

Then lay in 3-4 months worth of canned food for if things go really sideways.

"As stated in above response the intention is to be more of a bug-in kit for general emergencies, be they nuclear or otherwise.

-Cup is a good idea.  
-Don't live in a cold climate and there is no room for anything warm anyways but I was considering upgrading to a bigger box to fit a blanket. Maybe clothing if upgraded size would fit it.  
-The tablets I had lying around from some time ago. Wouldn't you add them to an emergency box? And yes I know they do not make you radiation proof.  
-Food storage (elsewhere) is intended to be edible without fire, but am contemplating having a portable cooking setup. 

The idea is simply that it would be good to have emergency supplies from the house concentrated in one case. Useful for earthquake, power outage, storm, war, whatever.

"I just look for things to make general comments on when I see my neighbors outside. I spend a lot of time talking about the weather. I guess the best way to foster SHTF trust is starting with general trust, such as offering to keep an eye out for your neighbor. My neighbor had gutter issues, so we gave them something we already had to help them. They used their drone to check out the roof tiles we lost during a storm. They asked us to keep an eye on their house when they went on vacation. It just went back and forth like that. We also became parents at the same time and had trouble with the same neighbors. We have the same education level. For a few hours a year of friendly chatting and some exchange of favors, I feel like I could trust my neighbors in a SHTF scenario. I think we care about each other enough to look out for each other. I do similar stuff with other neighbors, but I feel like the neighbors I mentioned are the real MVPs.

I also want to add to just be careful of what info you share with people about prepping. Obviously, what we do could deter people from interacting with us because we are focused on something considered taboo to some.

"I meant sanitation and hygiene more in the sense ""what if I can't flush and need to poop in a trash bag"", ""what if I can't take a shower for a week or two"" (antiperspirant, wet wipes), etc. You know, everyday stuff.

In general, the most useful way to bootstrap a preparedness plan is to think about these everyday scenarios. ""What if I can't do the usual stuff in the usual way"", versus ""how do I fend off tigers in the wilderness"". Anchoring to everyday scenarios also helps you avoid buying random stuff just for the sake of it. Another poster is talking about fire: you have fire starting tools, but what do you plan to do with this? Cooking, heating? Do you have a pile of firewood in the backyard, do you have a camping stove? Etc, etc.

Cash - again, depends on the scenario you're worried about. Probably good to have enough cash to get you through normal living expenses (groceries, etc) for two weeks or so. $200 may be aiming low.

"So I think this is more of a problem of how to be more sociable than it is about finding a MAG? If your sociable the rest is easy-ish. I mean you're objective is not to make converts you want to find likeminded people. You don't need to start a conversation about prepping with these people, that is the lens they view the world through and it seeps into everyday conversations. What do they talk about and how do they talk? Is their hobby raising chickens? When they talk about politics do they express concerns about the future will impact them? Do they have a small armory at home?

"When building relationships, its important to remember that it is a two way street. You remember that the person has to build a relationship with you as well.

An example is my local theater group and my father in law. He puts on a lot of the productions, and so I volunteer to help build the sets and props. I don't especially like theater or acting, but I know how to build those things so I use that to make a connection with the actors and stage crew. I'm wouldn't call them friends, but we wave to each other when we pass in public. In a SHTF situation I have no doubt we could work together, or at least I wouldn't be a complete stranger.

"Socially inclined AuDHD here who knows of some antisocial autist Community preppers.

Shared interests are a GREAT way to go. Anything that establishes you with people you feel would offer physical and emotional safety, skills, and resources.

Only for a person to consistently show through their actions/behavior that they are trustworthy and contribute in a way that others appreciate.

I've met a few anti-social community preppers over the years. Might sound counter-intuitive to some people. But it's not. Plenty folks view the community as the epicenter of survival, regardless of personal desire to be social. These preppers all contributed in their own ways. Two are on a discord server im on. (It's not a prepper server.) One leant their backyard for a Halloween party that they themselves didnt attend. And has dropped off some N95 masks and covid tests to me on a couple of occasions. They didnt stay to chat.  They don't participate in server discussions all that often, but when they do it is to request or share info or offer assistance with something they are comfortable doing. That one is well-recognized and respected, simply because they seem to have helped everyone at least once at some point in some way. They have some digital technology skill or other theyve used to help people with virtually. Im not clear on what all that entails. But suffice it to say, if they needed anything, they'd have plenty of people who would have their back. The other person is in different hobby channels than I am. So I dont have much of an impression at all. I just know they are a Community prepper because they briefly joined a discussion where it came up.

"We have a huge ground mounted array, with 10k kWh battery.   We are attached to the grid in a way that allows us to sell electricity to the system.  About 9 months of the year we make more than we use and accumulate credit, in winter we end up using some of that credit.  There are no fossil fuels powering the house the oven and stove and dryer are all electric.  We have one EV that charges at home.  Right now we waste electricity constantly, we have my 90 year old MIL living with us and so we use lots of heating and AC to keep her comfy.  We also mostly don't hang dry the laundry.  

When the grid goes down, the only reason I know is that the clock on the oven needs to be reset.  

If we had to be self sufficient, we'd probably hang dry the clothes, use the microwave more and ovens less, and consider less aggressive indoor climate control. 

Anyhow, in the US you can have a system as you describe but it's less common and requires likely additional 10k$ investment up front for the batteries.  

The fun part is programming it.  We can tell the system with fine detail what to do.  Do we prioritize selling electricity or filling the battery?  Overnight, how low to let the battery go before it starts to buy from the grid before the sun comes up again?   50%?  30%?  10%?",r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRU1kdktSUDgxT2lXXzV0a1dFbTlGMVpISkdkZEVuS0o1TmEycV91b3BET1JFcHlYZ3Y3TGZsNzR6cWd1alA5X0w1bnRiTm5nMmVFc09iZzNVOXJXaVE9PQ==

"Per bushcraft, here's a previous comment of mine:

Thankfully the majority of bushcraft can be practiced in a small backyard. Carving and whittling like spoons and kuksa's and camp utensils, woodworking and basic notching and joinery. Stone work and flint knapping. Processing and twisting cordage, learning knots and ropework. Weaving baskets, hats, sandals. Basic looms and more advanced weaving. Clay, daub, pottery. Netting as I mentioned above.

You can also practice building all kinds of traps and snares without needing to trap the game. I don't even have any large rocks, I use cinder blocks as weights.

Navigation and first aid are also large elements of bushcraft which can be practiced at home. I taught myself celestial navigation in my backyard.

If motivated you can build the parts of a cabin in a small space, notching short logs and building the individual features without the structure and size.

Richard Graves wrote ""The 10 Bushcraft Books"" which even Mors Kochanski credits as a resource for his own career which was extensive. In those books, you can do everything except, depending on the laws/rules/regulations, firemaking and shelter making and real trapping. That leaves hundreds of other skills to practice, just from his book alone.

There's actually many of those that can be practiced indoors, and one of my favorite things are those cheap moving blankets from harbor freight because you can lay one down and make a mess and shake it off outside.",r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRkJuZDhlMHVROXEtb0JmcG1xdnN4Tlk0SHIwbXFueEc2V0JHX2l5TTh5d2RsT05TR2NqRTBuUnZiRjdZc3ByM2wybnhnUVZiMExreW5lM3U4U1hMcnc9PQ==

"Water bottle cases will need to be used up quicker than most items, but it's the cheapest and easiest item to get. I rotate mine out every six months.

KI (Potassium Iodide) or KI03 (Potassium Iodate) only protects the Thyroid against ***future*** uptake of radioiodine (Iodine-131). If the Thyroid is already saturated with radioiodine, the KI (or KI03) will not be of benefit. If taken improperly KI/KI03 can cause more harm than good.
FYI...Radioiodine is just one minor radioactive isotope of many released in a Thermonuclear War. 

 Personally I would be more concerned about Cesium-137 & the ""remedy""...Radiogardase (Prussian Blue). 

Even better is the ability to detect fallout, exactly which radioactive isotope(s) you are dealing with & more importantly, how to build a decent fallout shelter so as to minimize or eliminate getting ARS (Acute Radiation Syndrome) after a GTW (Global Thermonuclear War).

"Seems you kind of glossed over that? 90% of those skills can be done indoors too.

The only things you can't do indoors are shelter, fire, and map and compass navigation but you can still practice many aspects of navigation just practicing on the floor, taking bearings, converting distance into pace count and estimating to yourself distance and time.

Knots and ropework, carving, all those types of things you can do in a small space.

If you want to find land to do larger projects, it's not legal to cut down and build structures in most national or state parks, so you'll need to find land. and that's where it takes individual resourcefulness.

I've done as much as email land owners, and indeed had success many times. Often with the caveat of cold camping (no fire) but the ability to down trees and build shelters. You can understand often strangers don't want other strangers building fires on their land, but they're usually happy if you clear some down brush.

"My tips for prepping on a budget:

1. Spread out the cost. Put the supplies together over the course of time, starting by covering the basics recommended by [Ready.gov](https://www.ready.gov/))
2. The best price is free. Food Banks, free cycle, Craigslist free pages, etc. 
3. Reuse vinegar or other safe, food grade jugs to store water (no glass jars!) See link for choosing and cleaning a safe container to reuse.) https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/emergency/creating-storing-emergency-water-supply.html
4. Start with a smaller goal: 3 days of emergency food & water. Grow supplies over time.
5. Shop the sales - Frequent sale-checking boosts success. 
6. Shop at second hand outdoor stores
7. REI has used gear (I got a virtually new $150 backpack for $30 there). Downside, must be a member to purchase their online used gear. But their in-store used gear might not require membership.
8. (Almost) Anything is better than nothing. If you can't get the very best version of things, start with a version you can that will at least work. You can upgrade later once your basics cover at the pace your budget allows.


You came in excited to share and folks are raining on that. It's because there are some unwritten taboos here. Most of those have to do with combatting prepper stereotypes that discourage friends and family members from having anything to do with prepping. Others have to do with reducing survival chances for yourself and others in your area. (Which probably includes a few of us.) Unfortunately, the way you wrote your post tripped the wire.

Insights I hope will help:

1. Generally, anyone who gives the impression they prep guns before basic supplies, and that they prep medical gear above their level of training, won't be taken seriously. 

2. Generally, if you give the impression that you're a Hollywood prepper (aka that your SHTF plan is to mow people/your neighbors down with a gun like some scene out of a movie, among other things) high chance people wont take you serious/will get abrasive. If you have a hair trigger towards desperate people, you could kill essential resources (doctors, electricians, pharmacists, etc. without realizing it. If you do, you cause the deaths of many more people in consequence. We aren't in a movie. We have to think about the full chain of consequences. 

3. Generally, if you need a tourniquet, then you need a reliable one. If your tourniquets cost less than $15 each, it is probably a waste of money and space and may get someone else killed. I recommend North American Rescue (NAR) brand CAT tourniquets. It's what was recommended in my Wilderness First Aid class and are carried by the street medics I've met. Also for consideration: a wound that requires a tourniquet, requires skills/supplies to survive after. So hopefully at least a surgeon and wound care specialist. (Even with, still pretty low chance of survival in SHTF.) Hopefully no one has shot them over a can of corn or you're even more likely to be fucked. 

As for the financial preppers, most people here don't expect you to buy a house. Your scenario is clearly SHTF. And why buy a house if plenty will be vacant and essentially free to move into should your scenario come to pass?

 It is good advice, and potentially more realistic (hopefully) to pay down debt though, from the perspective that debt has higher probability to hamper your in-progress reality, than the probability of SHTF (depending on your country), despite the impression purchase-me preppers, like Youtuber Canadian Prepper, gives that SHTF is happening next week (for several years now...).

I hope we haven't scared you off. This sub is a great resource. But it does come with a learning curve, more expansive than I was able to cover  (And not 100% consistent. Hence my use of the word ""generally"". It's the internet.)

"While the Radiacode is a fun little toy, it is woefully inadequate for major radiological incident.  It tops out at 100 millirem and would be over-ranged by a nuclear incident or nuclear war.

KI (Potassium Iodide) is not currently recommended for post nuclear detonation protection because inhalation is not a major concern with local nuclear fallout.  There is some nuance to that when it comes to longer-range ""global fallout"" but there hasn't been enough investigation into whether it will provide sufficient benefit or not.  Kearney does discuss it in one of the chapters of his book, however.

Prussian Blue (Radiogardase) is prescription-only and completely unnecessary post-nuclear war.  Unless you're eating copious amounts of fallout, there's no reason to use it.  It is more for contamination incidents involving Cs-137 specifically.  Nuclear weapon fallout does include Cs-137, it's a changing mixture of hundreds of other materials.  There just isn't enough evidence to suggest that PB would be of significant benefit for post-nuclear war.

Apart from that I agree with most of what you wrote.  Especially the last part.  It's important to learn about and understand radioactivity even if only a rudimentary or basic level.  Radiation monitors are not magic boxes and will only tell you a number.  It's up to you to interpret that number.

"Not sure how to describe my view. I am primarily a homesteader with prepping overlap.

I live rural, so prepping for Tuesday doesn't even count as prepping. In the 25 years I've been here, I highly doubt we have ever gone 3 months without losing power for at least a few hours. I recall when my daughter was probably one, waking us up for food, and... No power. I just took the flashlight always hanging on the wall, found the butane hotplate, then heated up her bottle, and made coffee in the Boden. It is more like a pleasant surprise when I wake up and have power. 

I tend to get paranoid if I don't have at least 200 cans of sardines in the pantry. We generally keep it around 400. We might be over that now because the manufacturer was having a sale of mystery boxes. 25 cans for $12, so I bought 4 boxes. We got a few sardine in spring water cans, which we use for giving the cats their worm medicine, the rest were meh to good. 

But I grow tons of food that we store for winter, we raise about 50 chickens per year, we just got back into rabbits. We save all kinds of seed. We can survive indefinitely on most seed. Just the hybrid things like broccoli and brussel sprouts have to be purchased. I have even managed to figure out the biennials like carrots and parsnip.

Which brings me to my primary reason. I enjoy figuring out how to do things with as little modern input as possible. 

My current project is running a water line out to the coops. I currently run a hose during the summer, but I want to run it 2 ft underground so it won't freeze on moderate winters, and probably just a month in hard winters. My uncle, next door, has a mini excavator I can use any time, but I prefer using my pick mattock and shovel. 

I just enjoy figuring out, and doing things, as they did 100 years or more ago. I can't explain it, but I feel no satisfaction just using an excavator, but every 6ft of my trench I dig, I can sit back and appreciate they work. 

My objective remains enjoying trying to meet as many of my needs without resorting to modern means. If the world collapsed I'll be better off than 99% of people, but if it doesn't, I will still enjoy doing what I do. Next? Figure out how to make decent vinegar. It is harder than people think.",r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcHFLYzMycGFaTGhQVlN3NWVSeEtfM2JHcUNYRzNTQ2xWX0Y0bDVYUGFMNWRHanY0ZTJZOGdZOGVvbzMwekhtdldCQm1JaFN2N3JzX19vWGlZdkxJSWc9PQ==

"Devil is in the Details...🤣

The NukAlert is for higher level Gamma Detection (filling in for a Survey Meter) & Radiacode is for post-GTW day-to-day lower level uses (filling in for a Geiger Counter, Dosimeter & ***much*** more)....such as ascertaining if someone is properly decontaminated after reentering shelter & removing PPE, verifying food/water/milk/etc is safe to consume (including food grown ***long*** after GTW), for mapping out the areas to plant a garden with the lowest levels of radiation (using a drone or ankle band) or determining how much of the topsoil needs to be removed, etc. Many more uses...

Laboratory Grade Prussian Blue is available without prescription. As far as Cesium-137....

""Cesium-137 (Cs-137) is a radioactive isotope that is a byproduct of nuclear fission and can be found in the environment ***after nuclear weapons tests*** and nuclear reactor accidents. It has a half-life of about 30 years and can be absorbed by food crops, posing a health hazard. Exposure to large amounts of Cs-137 can cause burns, radiation sickness, and even death. It can also lead to malignant tumors and shortened life.""

Cesium-137  ""is also the most dangerous of all radioactive isotopes."" Which is why some governments stock (rather expensive) Radiogardase for GTW. Just like the shuttered Civil Defense Shelters, I just don't expect any for the taxpayers though, but no doubt enough for ""Continuity of Government""! 🙄

"I evacuated from Fort McMurray in 2016 due to wildfires. Some areas of the city were evacuated this year for the same reason.

Similar situation. One way in, one way out.

We're currently surrounded by wildfires. The joys of living in the middle of the Boreal forest. No immediate risk to the community at this time and no evacuation orders in effect. 

My three biggest learnings from 2016:

1) Never allow your fuel tank to run below half tank.

2) Always have a couple of Jerry cans of fresh fuel ready, just in case. 

It's surprising how fast a gas station can run dry!

"Of course you can. Think of what you’d need in a power outage - heat/cooling, air purifiers, food preservation (Keeping your fridge/freezers on), cooking, lights, communication. Think of what you’d need if you lost water flow or it was contaminated - not only drinking/cooking, but also hygiene and plumbing. Think of what you’d do with your trash if garbage service stopped. 

Although owning a home allows you to make some specific preps, like adding a larger solar system, or whole house generator, or changing the landscape for gardening, or putting in a rain collection system… there are work arounds for all those things for renters. Heck, if you wanted, you can change a room into a fallout shelter or safe room in a way that can be undone when you leave. 

Ensure your home has good security… there are many systems that don’t require building or grounds alterations.

The most common problems you are going to run into involve unexpected bills (car breaks down, medical expense, etc.), losing your job unexpectedly or other issue where having a reserve fund makes a catastrophe into a mere inconvenience.  It also comes in handy in some of the realistic cases where you might have to bug out - wildfire (or simple house fire), tornado / hurricane, flood, etc...

">Wolves […] will go after people who they think might be easy prey. I know of a situation where someone wrecked a car on that road and a pack of wolves held the people at bay

_Wolves_ go after people? I know Coyotes and Coywolves are ballsy little f\\*\\*kers that would gladly try a human - there have been coyote attacks on humans in Vancouver’s Stanley Park, after all - but I thought _North American_ wolves in particular required their prey to be running away in order to effectively attack.

I have run across many old stories of, when surrounded by wolves, most cowboys and wilderness folk would get off their horses and wrap the horse’s head in their jacket to prevent the horse from panicking and bolting. Then they would calmly walk the horse along until the wolves gave up and left.

I’ve also seen videos where the wolves would intentionally charge deer in order to make it run, and absolutely not attack the deer _until_ it un-froze and began to run. As in, the wolves seemed incapable of effectively taking down the deer _until_ it began to run away.",r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZQVRJaWhtVTBYanNjYTltbWxib1pSenlscUhrams3WHZRS0hHLWVYVWpoRGN2dmVtYTVMaDJ4T2huQlpVLUJXNjNmQmxTcG5ocXpfeGR6d3pLaEZYRnc9PQ==

"Thoughts.. 

If you can get an RV or a traitor out there, you can often buy them used for a good price. Especially RVs or buses with blown engines that you just want to tow out there to stay in one place. There are ways to seal the roof so they can provide shelter for a long time. 

I’ve seen great some shed conversions, but mostly from wooden sheds like Tuff sheds, and they can be quite expensive for the larger ones. There are several YouTube videos on shed conversions. You can put up a shed to its specs and then make it more hardy, but it’s harder to do with plastic or aluminum than a wood build. Instead of something like you describe, you might want to look into a wooden shed kit, it would be a little more stable and easier to add insulation and drywall. 

You may want to look into something like a yurt or the type of heavy-duty tent and stove that is made for winter camping. 

Cement is cheap. I’d dig down 3-4 feet and do cement floor, then build cement walls and a ceiling. It has heating and cooling advantages, and is bullet and fire resistant… but it takes some specific skills to do cement walls/roofs, not to mention labor and time. It’s much easier to do if you’ve got a good water source. Although this would be my preferred building type, I’d personally go with a used trailer or a yurt due to labor required to build a cement shelter in an area you have to haul in cement bags and didn’t hs e a garden hose. If you’re willing to haul it out there, cement blocks are easier to build with, but you’ve still got the roof to construct. 

Finally, you might want to look into earthbag homes. They are pretty awesome and you can use the dirt and materials around you. For these you can dig a foot or two (or more) down and use that dirt to fill your bags. It’s one of the least expensive and most insulated ways to go. If you do this, know that they can last a really long time… as long as you put the right coating on them. Sandbags break down in the sun pretty quickly if you don’t coat them right, but there are several options. 

If you’re really adventurous and motivated, you can build a great, lasting and insulated shelter out of brick/stones or mud bricks/waddle. 

Sounds like fun… if you have the time and energy.",r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRmdIRF9JZmRfOG9mWHVGVnRxUHVJSDBpbVJlMmJicXJTVFhDTmtlWEg4ZElZWm1QZ1J3NEFkRDgtaUNNMzVWV3NWVzY1RTRCLVRVNUptRHc3dkE5Y3c9PQ==

And a few other posts recently around how to meet other preppers, how to find like minded people, how to form prepper groups, are posted here frequently, can go back and look at some of those.

Its unlikely that the ""shared interest in prepping will help you meet people"", mostly because there aren't really that many preppers, and, many aren't open / actively try to hide it.  I agree with others, that prepper adjacent hobbies CAN  help you meet people.  A local gun club near me has social events a few times a year.  

So, yes, you can meet preppers, but I wouldn't look to that as a way to be most of your social network, if that makes sense.  Like, those are two separate issues.

"To expand on my earlier comment--

In addition to macronutrients (protein, fats, and carbohydrates), you will need micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals. The first part of the word ""vitamin"" (""vita"") means ""life"".

Dark leafy greens, carrots, radishes, red/yellow/orange peppers, tomatoes, onions, garlic, etc. are very nutritious and promote health over the long haul. Brightly colored veggies (and to a lesser extent fruits) are packed with vitamins. Try to get a mix of colors every day as an easy way of covering all the vitamins.

This is why seeds are an essential part of a long term plan. If you have seeds you've got a shot at a future. ""No seeds"" means that these foods, carefully bred for literally thousands of years in many cases, are lost to your family. So buy seeds. Buy a lot of extra seed, since you can expect garden failures, and will need extra seed to try again in different locations.

Seeds are living things, so purchase new packets every year or two to ensure good germination rates. It varies by plant-- for example, onion seeds have a very short life, but beans have a long life. I buy fresh packets every year, and save all the old packets to have extras (even if they only have 30% germination, that's still better than nothing). You can't have too many seeds, since any extra packets can be given to friends/neighbors or be used for trade.

While waiting for your garden to grow, you can try gathering wild greens like dandelions for a while, but these are often too high in bitter compounds and oxalates for long-term use. Domesticated garden veggies have been bred for nutrition with fewer troublesome compounds.

tldr: buy seeds. buy way more than you think you'll need.",r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZaW9OSllvMUpmRlNES296U1g4RU02aGpWUXNjUGU3dTZqdDNEOEVjYmNRQkpqM3lITElIMFh3ZFc0MnhXQk4xZ3o0VmdxWVIyTjdRM0d5U29meGpHcHc9PQ==

"""For fun"" doesn't sound right but factually and materially I guess I am not as serious about this as I could be. I am  poor, disabled and currently unable to work because I am having so many surgeries and so much recovery time. I have to keep living in a big city because I often times need emergency medical care or even emergency surgery. 

So what I can prepare is very minimal. Most of it is gaining knowledge. About skills, tools and my surroundings. Due to living alone and often times being stuck here for a long time during recovery,  I have plenty of food here and could go at least two months with it currently. But my most likely scenario wouldn't be to bug in. I prep for a house fire, power outages and most importantly: financial hardship. I know how to mend clothes, I know a few things about repairing household things, I know how to make a lot of food from very little etc. I also try to be as physically fit as I can. Not necessarily for a big shtf scenario but mainly so I won't be knocked down by the first fall in my 70s or 80s. Women have a bigger risk to not recover from that because our muscle mass deteriorates after the menopause. So building muscle is key. 

In case of a big shtf scenario like a war, I'd have to make my way to my family who live more rural. I have a plan for that, a bag and I know several ways by foot to get there. 
But all that is pretty useless when I am just out of surgery. I'd probably just die. People say war is unrealistic but I live in Germany. The upcoming election in the US will determine a lot if there will be war here or not. The US will deploy weapons here either way, which makes our big cities a target of russia. Unrealistic maybe? But not as unlikely as a war in the US itself. I am this paranoid because the signs of the last war are still here. The people in my life who lived through that war and still remember the one before that could still tell me about it first hand. I don't want to panic and over react, but I don't feel like having  a plan in place is useless. 

I can't really prep by buying things. I have a list of what I'd need to buy to survive in a war scenario but that's all not affordable right now (namely my ostomy supplies). 

So why am I here? For window shopping? Honestly, prepping makes me feel secure. I have a lot of shit going on in my life and not a lot of control over things. So I might as well take control over what's possible. My medical issues scare me, being poor scares me. I am scared of what's happening in the world and where we are heading, even without a big shtf event. I am not ashamed to say that I am just scared. And I really love this life, I don't want it to be threatened by something I could have been prepared for. 

In an ideal world I'd get healthy and be able to work again. I'd prepare by saving money for my future and that would be it. But I don't see that ideal world.",r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZY05FQzRpVk5fdUhiVUxtR013bjlyQ1dwWDNzZ3ZZUlk4U2NVMlM2QVNVLWh0bzZCbW1xSjBpNkxtQlR1REs4NnR1c0NRckpLQ0JzeXhYNk96cW1pNUE9PQ==

I've tried asking multiple women I've dated if they were into prepping. Each one was a no. I feel like preppers are naturally cautious and more independent. I've only met a handful of actual preppers who have all been males. But I'd love to have a girlfriend who's into prepping like I am. Right now I'm single and don't mind it.

"In high school I had a Science of Survival class. They taught orienteering skills mostly, map reading, how to find edible plants, fish and insects, how to make a shelter in the woods, and some first aid. I started my senior year

As I pointed out earlier there are many situations where your house or flat may be destroyed. It takes less than an hour for a forest fire to start and get out of control if it's spruce woods and dry. A Tornado can blow a house apart in seconds, hurricanes drop trees and wash houses out to sea if you live on the coast, an earthquake can make a house dangerous to enter or flatten it in a few seconds. You cannot rely on storing food and water to get you through a disaster. There is no guarantee you will have a place to store it or be able to access it during and after the disaster.  I've lived through several and I've seen economic collapse in Mexico ( volunteer working as a student) . It's not just theory I've been through it.

What you might want to learn right now are skills related to camping and backpacking. If something happens shelters and refugee camps quickly deteriorate and become havens for disease, hunger and crime. It is best to avoid them. Can you set out on foot, in a manually powered boat or bicycle and stay out for a couple weeks til things cool down? Probably not right now. Yet being able to "" bug out"" is the best option for most scenarios you will encounter. Could we have a war? Yes it's possible, but not super likely, and even if we do it's not going to affect all of North America, it's just too big and most of it is sparsely populated still ( compared to England and Europe)

I would learn backpacking and bike packing first. Just doing overnights with a few friends. Learn what you need what works and what doesn't

Learn to forage and fish. You have to develop a taste for wild vegetables. They're more bitter than the kind you get in the store but also better for you. Seeds are also important. Learn to garden, guerrilla gardening, how to process a rabbit or chicken to eat it. Learn to cook over an open fire or with a jet boiler, how to can and dry food. Learning stealth camping is a good idea as well.

You cannot depend on a supply it will run out, and you cannot depend on the place you are storing it to be available or intact. Plus that kind of Meal Ready to Eat food is astronomically expensive for the benefit. You have to be self sustaining . Developing the ability to live on your own without help, keeping a low profile are very important to surviving in a bad situation.",r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZSGJuWmhzUVc1d3ZsTm9IV2laREpiVUVNdk1pTlZoQVdaOVJDV3ZZbzh3aXp0M2RJcW5JaGMtekJFeU4wbUNvTmR4cGZyNXVxeHI0Sm83TnBsSWpiUXppMzU3ZFR6V3liNXlJY0tRN1Bla1E9

"I am in a situation where we are experiencing frequent problems with fires, storms and economic inflation. I'm having to improve our ability to deal with unpredictability and possibility of losing power frequently and for longer periods of time.

It's more of a matter of skill building for me. This is going to be a long term problem that probably will not get better in my lifetime. We might lose utility services at some point which will shut down the supply completely. ( no power, can't pump fuel, trucks and boats can't run) So I want to make sure we can get through it without government aid because you cannot depend on that resource to be there for you.

I live where I can grow raise and forage as needed, but I think skills are more important. Yes I preserve food but it's mostly to help with expenses.

"I had huge social issues growing up. I've never been diagnosed with anything but who knows. I was pretty much on my own. 

 I would suggest going camping, particularly boondocking and backpacking. Those people have the skills and the knowledge. You will have to force yourself into this.

"Don't be in Washington DC when it's called.  Understand that this is a diversion covering up something else. If you care about who gets in the White House you are too dependent.

"Wood gas was used to power vehicles, stationary motors, and gas burners were used as early as World War two. Then there is methane  from animal manure and trash dumps. Gas from bio mass. Lower compression motors will run on any flammable liquid. Solar is great when the sun is out, but electronics and panels need protection from emp and severe weather. If moving water is available,  water powered turbines produce continuous power. Small wind turbines will charge batteries. Larger ones can AC or DC current.
Animal fats can used in wick lanterns and heaters. Cheap Hot water using a simple system. Put a storage tank on a hill or tower. Install solar water heaters below the tank, can use black pvc (hot water rated/sch 80) or black hose. One end at the base of tank and other end two to three feet higher.

"My tip is shop the immediate days following major holidays, and other holidays too. Stores often have surplus items that did not sell; as well as holiday-related food and non-food items that are drastically discounted. 

For example, after Easter and Christmas, you can often find cheap whole hams and turkeys, boxed/bagged stuffing, jar gravy, some canned veggies. Also, Easter/Christmas themed cookies, crackers, candy, powdered coffee creamer, coffee, etc. are often more than half off. Halloween and Valentine’s candy and themed food are heavily discounted too.

I have 6 frozen turkeys and several hams that I paid less than $5 each, shopping this way after Christmas/Easter. I don’t think I’ve paid more than $5 for a whole turkey or ham in the last decade. 

After Easter you often find seafood discounts as stores stock more seafood during Lent. Seafood that didn’t sell as well is discounted. 

Also, after these major holidays—I often find great deals on ground chicken, salmon, whole chickens, deli meats or hamburger. I imagine sales of those items decreases due to people buying whole turkey, hams—which often leads to a surplus of other protein sources. 

Important: It’s not only after the “major” holidays that you find great discounts, but also holidays that often revolve around long weekends and get togethers, such as July 4, Memorial Day, Labor Day, Father’s/Mother’s Day. I recently found $1.99 80/20 hamburger after Memorial Day weekend and Kraft 16 oz bags of mozzarella for 50 cents (shredded cheese freezes well). 

Also, some stores will have post-holiday sale sections. Aldi, Target, Walmart, nearly all grocers—have sections/shelves devoted to post-holiday sale items. I always find holiday-themed coffee for half price at Aldi (even after Halloween). If you have Starbucks inside a Target, their Christmas/winter-themed coffees/cups are 50% after the holiday; 75% off about a week post-holiday.

When you’re shopping during holidays, pay attention to the holiday-themed items. There’s so much of this stuff! Often you’ll find cold breakfast cereals, coffee, chocolate, granola bars, nuts, beverages, pasta, ice cream, frozen cookie dough, coffee creamers, paper towels, napkins, paper plates, plastic ware, etc. that are holiday themed. Most of that is drastically discounted after the holidays. Halloween and Valentine’s often have a ton of themed food that will be reduced (eg - Valentine/heart-shaped pasta; Halloween themed Cheerios, etc). Sometimes you can find excess corned beef post St Patrick’s Day. 

Shop the day after the holiday for best selection. However, new, discounted items will show up throughout the week after holidays like July 4, Memorial Day, Father’s/Mother’s Day as stores adjust their inventory. 

Hope this helps! I save so much money and get so many great deals this way.",r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZQ0hfMlRzQzYzU0VoZ2hnUTJzRlc0SGdEM2hTczFVR3pUQ0IwTUd5TFRDbUJsY0FTVmNVQVhaUUdZazBKcXJQSlVJOUJKVTdVRFd6ZUdqYS05bjAxX3c9PQ==

"I like your mindset. I too want to preserve society (what is left, and what did not cause what happens to need my expertise) but the idea of durability in the tools used to continue..? A gun to me is an equalizer. The use of which has negative repercussions but usually positive outcomes. A smaller person with a gun can end a problem with a larger person who has only physical size but is trying to exert force (basically, rape defence) positive defensive outcome. Using the gun will have repercussions if done wrongly (someone is shot and now there is trouble) negative repercussions. BUT, I would rather have it than not. Now I have this tool. I need to use, maybe. Best if I know how. To those that don’t know shooting a target can be difficult. Short barrels allow for errant shots due to short sight alignment (bad for long range good for CQB). Long barrels are an issue of mobility (great for hunting bad for CQB). Shotguns are a middle range solution. All that prep talk has me tingling….but what about the user? The person using this tool? Are you planning for usage just for immediate defence (pocket revolver, or Liberator)? Are you planning for forage and hunting (‘ol .306)? Are you looking for hold out defence (shotguns in your hallway maze)? But the best option you have is figuring out what you want. Then the SHTF happens and see where you are. Did you prep? Are you ready? 

Well that depends on if you prepped right, do you know all the shit I just wrote? Am I wrong in what I wrote? How do you know? To know you need to train. To train that takes time and effort. That means using that gun at a range or while hunting to learn. And that means rounds through the barrel.

"The psychological importance of good food is nearly as important as nutrition.  Most people could not eat pasta and beans for a WEEK without psychological suffering... Being in a shitty hopeless sad mood, for short or for long, can be deadly in a high stakes scenario where you'd need that much stored food.  YEARS of eating pasta and beans would feel like unbearable torture, and many would curse themselves for not preparing variety and flavor.  

Optimal way to do it is a deep pantry.  Most of your favorite pantry foods last 1+ years.  So when something you already normally buy is on sale, buy a dozen.  Eat what you buy.  

For example, last time I was at Sam's Club, 160 oz Quick Oats was on sale for $9.98. I know 160 oz is ~120 meals, so at the rate we eat it will take 2~3 months.  I check the expiration date is in 6 months and I know it will still be good at least 12 months after then.  So I buy 6 containers. Thats 720 meals (101,700 calories) for only $60! And we will eat it.",r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZMDZCV0FaSXBJS1FLWm5HNW9LTHhZdGFfWVZrSDg3RXpXMjlGcElTekFscUx3amRPUW9zWEtLMU5TdnhJMi0xaDJmUkk2TENhOERZYkRYQldxYmh6a3c9PQ==

"Realize scurvy is caused by a lack of vitamin C. Sailors may have had plenty of calories but without vitamin C they fell ill regardless. I also want to be clear nutritional deficiencies can be quite severe. Again scurvy for example was no laughing matter. Not only does it cause things like teeth falling out and fatigue which could be bad news if you are in an emergency situation and need to work hard but also much more serious symptoms like scar tissue breaking down and old wounds reopening and the inability to heal new injuries. Scurvy literally kills as result from complications like bleeding or from infections from open sores. All from a (prolonged) lack of just 1 vitamin, vitamin C.

Him: “Oh me and my buddy, who I trust with my life, have it all planned out, we’d go to base and grab all the weapons and ammo we can and go up north and find a family that has a farm and food and other stuff and massacre them and then live on the farm”
He said this all with a straight face and cocky bravado. 

Me: “why would you massacre them? Wouldn’t you offer to provide them protection in exchange for shelter and food?”

Him: “Nah, I’d never really be able to trust them so I’d rather just kill them.”

At least he was honest. I ended the date shortly after. We had met in a public place and drove separately of course. 

Now I’m in a LTR and my boyfriend isn’t really a Prepper but I trust him and I know he’d get on board quick when SHTF. Plus he’s into hiking and I joke with him that his truck camper is our bug out vehicle lol. He even attended an emergency preparedness convention with me. 

The right person is out there for you sis, they may not be a Prepper *yet* though.

"An active adult male needs about a million calories a year (2,600 daily)

Doing this on the cheap...

* 400 lbs wheat berries 
* 400 lbs rice 
* 400 lbs beans 
* 4x 3 gallon jugs of peanut oil 

You can put about 34 pounds of grain in a 5 gallon bucket. So this is about 36 five gallon buckets and 4 jugs of oil. Stacked three buckets high this is 3 buckets wide, 4 buckets deep and 3 buckets tall to visualize a year of calories.


I would also add 10 lbs of salt. 
50 lbs of sugar. 

Rice and beans are about a dollar a pound. Wheat berries about 1.50. So about 1600 dollars 

To make it less boring. Add protein. Spam. Tuna. Sardines. Freeze dried eggs. Freeze dried veges.

Also remember that most people are more likely to be using their phones than a full on computer or laptop. These have a much lower power draw and only have wifi or mobile data for internet connectivity.

The only realistic use of all that cable in such a scenario would be like an internet cafe or library where you've got a bunch of computers situated close together within the same building.

I've been thinking about doing a similar setup and was thinking of using a combination of Raspberry Pi's with USB storage drives, solar+battery and a wifi router.

"Great answer, but a little high on the estimates.  Using your 2600 calorie base expenditure, and 1 lb of wheat berries, rice, and beans each averaging about 1500 calories per lb, you'd only need around 500 lbs total per year of any of those three in any combination. Since you'd likely be supplementing with gathered plants, garden, oils (as you mentioned), and being a little hungry sometimes isn't a bad thing, I would estimate around 350 lbs per year for men and proportionally less for women and children.

You're right though, don't forget the ""extras"" - salt, sugar, proteins, freeze dried veg, spices, etc or you're going to have a very boring year of food.

For self protection you have to use force multipliers. Knives, guns, and pepper spray are the best. ""Stun guns"" are a joke when it comes to self defense, avoid them. 



Men are going to be bigger and stronger than you on avarage. What that means is that you have to work your ass off when it comes to physical strength just to be on par with them.

"You do you. It takes one guy with the foresight to download maps in advance, and share them with like-minded individuals, to ruin your day.

"> What are your theories on what's to come post November?

immediately? large-scale violent street clashes, looting + military presence in big cities, right-wing militiamen on the prowl for an opportunity to use their guns. probably two big waves of this, one after the election and one when trump gets inaugurated (the only plausible outcome atp). the former will be a lot like 2020 while the latter will be much worse. tiananmen square and kent state will look like a tea party. 

long term? continued sporadic violence and stochastic terrorism from every end of the political (insert shape here). televised military tribunals of disloyal politicians, all as promised. concentration camps for illegal immigrants will be built (perhaps from the remnants of the flying car megacities that trump has promised and will fail to build) that have a solid chance of gradually morphing into forced labor and/or extermination camps when the government learns the same lesson as the germans did, that deporting millions of people is harder than enslaving or killing them. the victims will not be limited to illegal immigrants — transgenders, communists, palestine protesters, legal immigrants from muslim and latin american countries, and democratic volunteers and voters will be on the chopping block, in that general order. climate change and pollution will be severely exacerbated by the lack of regulations, and we will see natural disasters getting far worse. there will likely be quite a bit of gun grabbing, especially if you're a member of the ""undesirable"" groups, but everyone is at risk of losing their firearms — we know trump is not a 2A guy and especially won't be after what happened yesterday. his courts may eventually block such efforts, but only after it's too late for many of us. it took scotus years to undo his bump stock ban.

I travel with a HydroBlu Versa Flo kit with 2 water bladders. It can do bulk filtering and comes with an attachment to make a 5 gallon bucket (or larger) system.

For myself, I have a Zen tabletop filter and a Zero fridge pitcher. 

The main house well water is hard and has sulphur. There is a whole house filter but nothing does well against sulphur. The water still has a very distinctive smell unless it is filtered a second time. Due to the well depth, age and the repeated drilling and repairs, there is no access to bleach the well. I was told the next time the pump needs pulled  they can maybe create a hole for the bleach.

I live in an RV behind the house. My RV has several in-line filters and they actually do a fairly good job with the hard water and sulphur smells.

So my solution is several smaller filters. Instead of one large system.

Our backup water system is a cattle pond. Fresh water fed with high turnover. Besides the cattle, it also is full of bentonite clay. Bentonite clay and the using my HydroBlu is a no-no as are most young filters. 

So our pre-filter for that are several sand filters set-up with diatomaceous earth to try and pre-filter as much of the bentonite clay as possible before it goes through any other filter. We don't filter for taste as the smaller filters can do that. This is purely for the clay and fecal matter as the bacteria in an established sand filter will help break down any  bacteria and viruses.

What an immature sand filter will not work effectively against are microscopic cysts that are suspended in the water. While they will remove most cysts, younger sand filters will often fail at total removal.

So again, multiple (different) filters are used.",r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaQ3lSZjg2OWU2VHVRaXJ5QnRGRDNyNDlycXhKdDl6Zmw3UjU0bTgzMG5QQ1I0T2ZHd3FCVVM1TWstTDRuUjJxcVc1RDZ3bzE3TDA2N0xQbUdEbUExSW9QTGRFOHlldFhTYzJhWG1NcWI3S3M9

"Not single, but i never really had the conversation with my gf and i still prep? My gf talks about everything to everybody sometimes without realizing it so i just stock up on stuff. Theres some things i’ll buy where my parents and gf think it was an impulse buy, like we were at a garage sale last week and got a mr buddy heater for $25 and my gf was like why tf are you getting that? 

I reminded her of one time this past winter we changed our oil furnace out and realized we were missing a piece after the store had closed so spent the night freezing our asses off, so it made me kick myself that i wasn’t more prepared. It was a weird one because we had power just nothing else to heat the house with at all. 

My dad works on site and is able to bring back free stuff from camp, like small snack foods, or a 20 box of batteries he can get every so often for free, so i get him to bring me back a box of batteries every time he comes back and i tell him im stocking up for the kids toys and whatever (which is true) I also have him bring me back bulk supplies of oatmeal , he thinks i really like oat meal lol 

My preps have helped us through a few things this summer and i don’t think my gf has given my random stock piles a second thought lol

Im looking at under the bed storage containers to put a second pantry under, i’ve half assed pitched this to her already saying it we wouldn’t have to go to the store as often and it would be good to have if for some reason we cant get to the stores and she was on board, explaining to her our second pantry is under our bed might be a challenge though haha thats only because of limited storage in our house.",r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaYnVaVEZYYVNsWXNXY05iOVo1d21Ebmc1d2dvQzVsU3cwb0RsMTFpX3MxNUR1TzhIeXNEYVhTbUp2S1N0bGkyQWh0a3pReHVpY0ZhZzNpS2JDbVFYVmc9PQ==

"Nutrition and calories are both critical in the long term.  Variety of foods can help emotionally and psychologically but since each food has a somewhat different nutritional profile it can also help you avoid vitamin/mineral deficiencies. For example black beans have more iron and potassium but chickpeas have more calcium. (That may be the reverse but you get the point)

I keep a deep pantry and separate long term food storage and try to think thru the balance of calories, macronutrients (proteins, carbs & fats) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, etc). If you are planning on continually eating out of your food storage and replacing it, you have a lot of flexibility for what you buy since you don’t need the extra long shelf life. 

The core of my long term storage is wheat berries, rolled oats, white rice, and a variety of beans. These all have 20+ yr shelf life if properly packaged and stored and provide the calories, protein and carbs that I need.  They provide a range of micronutrients but need to be supplemented with items from my pantry, garden or foraging to avoid deficiencies. Vitamin A, C, b12, calcium are some of the nutrients they don’t provide enough of.  In case my garden or foraging isn’t possible, i keep some specific supplements and foods. I don’t keep multivitamins because I don’t take them regularly and they need to be rotated. Ascorbic acid powder has a very long shelf life since it doesn’t have the fillers and binders etc of tablets. Dehydrated carrots (10+ yr shelf-life) and canned pumpkin provide beta carotene for vitamin A. 

I also keep sugar, salt (not iodized it has long shelf life), vinegar, dried sea vegetables (ie seaweed, for the iodine not added to my salt), and instant coffee in my long term food storage. 

Fats are critical to health and not good candidates for long term storage. You can stretch their shelf life but not like dry foods.  I make sure I have a year or two of fats (oils, nuts & seeds, canned fish etc) in my pantry and chest freezer and rotate thru them.",r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaaW1NYmFsRTM1eHl4NmZUNWhVTWtrT2duOWczbnd4VEVTYWUzSXZnSVhTOV9aVk1VdjNmWVVOc2R3OHZBRHI3dUZJeU1CTjdaVklQVGdMaVg0RmJlcTlpRHVSd3VQdFJXZ1hXVzBwRmxqZUE9
"I used to use old 1 gallon milk/orange juice containers to store emergency water. And a few 1 liter jugs. This was in my college days.

I would write down the date I cleaned out the jug and filled it up. After 2-3 months of being under my bed (to avoid light) I would empty out the water and recycle the now empty jug. I regularly drank a lot of milk (and sodas), so I had a constant supply of new jugs.

Is this the best option? NO! But as a broke college student (who grew up in a city where boil water notices happened at least 3-4 times a year and was paranoid about water loss) I used what I could.

When I got a stable job, I upgraded to 7 gallon water containers designed to hold water for 6 months to a year.

"Mace? 

In India and other places they have anti-rape devises that can be inserted and.... They only try to rape once.

I bake, I cook, I can do hundreds of homesteading skills. I am also a great teacher. Ever heard of the saying ""an army travels on it's stomach""? Well I'm behind the lines making life easier for everyone else

Everyone should have value. Something that makes others want to be with or around them. 2 of the males in our group can cook very well. And normally that is fine. If they want to cook, I can go sit down somewhere and knit.

But in A SHTF situation, their value isn't in the kitchen. Mine is. They are the first line of defense. Mine is to keep the ammo ready and a meal cooking.

I can shoot with the best of them. And, if push comes to shove, sure  I'll be right there with them defending.

"Single male prepper (40s) in SoCal.  We exist.  I prep for Tuesday, wildfires, and earthquakes.  I'm into ham radio, the emergency communcations side mainly.  I used to do search and rescue and I used to teach disaster prep with the local Sheriff's Office (as a volunteer).

I don't talk about prepping much (or at all) anymore, because I'm single I can't ""take shifts"" with someone to guard my supplies.  My neighbors know I have a generator though.  In our ""public safety"" power outages (high winds, danger of power lines falling and sparking yet another massive wildfire), I run my gene and offer up my fridge/freezer, I extend a wifi network since I have fiber internet (not impacted by power outages like cable is) and I run a power cord out for people to charge up devices.  Keeps them happy with the noise (those that can hear it) and keeps them invested in my continued survival.  :)

My plans are to bug-in.  It's just not feasible to bug-out as a single guy.  Half my vehicle is stuff for my dog (and my dog).  The rest goes quickly.

Definitely easier to prep due to less supplies needed and no one telling you you're crazy, but also harder because you have to think of everything.  At least out here, whe have ""Tuesday"" events a couple times a year, so the stigma of prepping isn't as high.  Plus, I seem to always run into Mormons in my social circles and they love to prep.

"Look at ancient societies in history to see which cultures promoted women in power and for what reason.


Eg, the Norse & Germanic tribes had Volvas, ie seeresses.
 They were women who facilitated important business in the tribe, eg herbal medicine, legal disputes of inner village matters like divorces, nursery and being responsible for birth deliveries, education, craftsmanship especially related to textiles, farming, etc


In short, Volvas held such power of importance becos they were integral in the cohesion of their society and vital to the survival. 
 People always only think of warriors & weapons, but 90% of survival is about a working community & economy. 


Volvas and the importance of women rights waned and disappeared only after Christianity rolled over Europe and cut down the rights of women, so they had no way to be important anymore other than breeding. 


So the lesson is: learn useful skills that not many others have, and that make you a vital & valuable member of society.

A search for Plan B on Amazon shows prices from $7.23 up to $50. Now, I'm not saying that the most expensive product is obviously the right one, because I'd expect to see some counterfeiting there as well.

Neither of these articles are paywalled, btw

"F it I am going to put myself out here and share a bio I wrote for elsewhere... 

Hey everyone, my name is Ben. I’m 46 years of age and currently living in Sacramento, California. I have been interested in and actively prepping since I was a kid. Inspired by some of the old school survivalists who started it all, many of whom were Vietnam war veterans and also inspired by the 1984 movie and original 'Red Dawn' lol My older brother and cousins and I all saw that this was something we thought was important and also of course an opportunity to have fun. Being that I've been at this for a long time I am well rounded in my preparedness for most scenarios and live with a high level of peace of mind within that. 

I’m mostly Italian. I’ve never been married and have no children but want a family of my own. Seeking a woman who shares values and mindset where our lives and personalities can complement one another! I plan to buy land most likely in the Sierra Foothills (Northern) this year and not relocate outside of northern CA because most of my family is local. 

I prioritize my health and it is important to me to find someone who does the same. I stay active with a mix of lifting weights, daily walks and hikes, ruck marches, mountain biking, kayaking, snow skiing, firearms training. I love nature, camping and I am building out my truck to be useful for overlanding. My way of eating is carnivore / animal based / prioritizing protein / The Weston A. Price Foundation; and I always try to eat the best quality foods as it is the best medicine and have been doing so for many years. Libra / ESTJ / 6/2 Projector (Human Design). 

I am not religious, most accurately I would say I am an agnostic-atheist. I have my own sense of spirituality and I feel this most when in nature and when in devotion to loved ones.

Interests: reading, investing, entrepreneurship, AnarchoCapitialism, voluntaryism, history, philosophy, emergency preparedness, firearms training, hunting, homeschooling, homesteading, camping, longevity medicine, cooking & grilling, fine dining, live music and MUCH more. 

Not cv-19 vaccinated, never will be. Not vaccinating future children. 100% anti-vaccine. 

Academically, I hold a Master of Science in Nursing. I continue to broaden my education formally and always self-educating. Most recently I completed a 16 week ‘Root Cause Protocol Institute’ consultant program that I enjoyed. I have been working in allopathic healthcare system since I was 21 years old. I will be happy to provide for my future wife and children if we choose to defer to my income alone, with a mix of my active income from being a RN nurse case manager (100% remote), and plans for passive/semi-passive incomes once on a property. 

I believe in traditional values in the sense of commitment, loyalty, and prioritizing each other and our family above all else. Traditional gender roles. I would like to meet a feminine woman who is physically fit, active, and interested in holistic health. Someone who likes homesteading and living closer to nature. Strong preference for a woman who doesn't drink (or rarely does) or smoke. 

Just imagining the possibility of dedicating myself wholeheartedly to my wife and my family fills me with an indescribable sense of fulfillment. I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to experience all the joys that accompany life's special moments, as well as the growth that arises from navigating through challenging times together. I am warm, thoughtful and affectionate, with high EQ. I want to be best friends and lovers with my wife, and laugh together often! 

Note: I don't plan to connect with anyone who already has children, that is just my preference based on previous experiences. Must want to have at least one child. Based on messages and subsequent conversations I have been receiving from women I decided to add here that I am not interested in being a step-father, adopting, fostering, or having children via surrogacy. 

If any of this resonates with you and you think we might be a match feel free to DM me here and share at least a couple clear face and full body photos, share your age, which should be young enough to have children. If you've read this far into what is practically reaching novel length lol, thank you! Good luck to everyone on finding their person.

">Concerns are discussed at the rate they occur...

>...less than 10% of rapes committed, and thus only gets 10% of the conversation.

We're getting rather side-tracked here, but I felt it was important to note that the statistics are only going to include the instances that are talked about on at least some level, as in reported, and given that men appear to be less inclined to report rape (and abuse in general) it's likely safe to assume that the actual rate is higher than reported, and potentially *much* higher. 

Bringing it back around to the women collecting firewood because they'll *only* be raped whereas the men would be killed: It's safe to assume that at least some of the men would be raped before being killed. How often that would be the case is something of an unknown, but we can assume it wouldn't be 0%. So the overall risk for men in that situation is, in some ways, higher. 

And bringing *that* back around to the original topic of how women can prepare: It's good for us to have the awareness/reminder that a SHTF scenario that reaches the level of Yugoslavia's situation could include the potential sacrifice of self for the sake of loved ones. Women who might otherwise be safe from rape (or other unlovely things) could find themselves choosing to accept greater risk if it means they can keep someone they love safer. And that applies to men as well, but the topic of this post is how women can prepare so... 😶",r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaWE9SVW5CdnVRTXRRaUNEMmtyMXNEc2E2NjFwbzJpckRCelREZXA3cW1WWTV0NVp6WDI2cVh2VjhPZlpiSmYtVHFfRHh3T0tsWG95S0JzdXV0bEVRb3c9PQ==
"I got really interested when you mentioned Christine Helliwell (I fantasize about designing my own societies, so whatever hacks could prevent rape from happening would be extremely welcome elements of design) and the first case that Google provided was [a student essay](https://www.studocu.com/en-us/document/university-of-virginia/social-and-cultural-anthropology/helliwel-walley-grade-a/2025618) about her study of the Gerai people.

  
My dudes, it sounds like the Gerai didn't see rape as rape.  It's not that it's a culture 'in which it doesn't occur.'  What Westerners would consider 'rape' does happen in the Gerai, the Gerai just don't see it as different from simply 'breaking the rules.'  

If y'all got any instances of cultures where rape doesn't actually occur, I really wanna know.

"Yeah, I don't know how well both at the same time would work. On the other hand, concealed carry isn't a deterrent and by the time a woman decides a guy might be a problem he could be too close to draw on. Guns are only fast weapons when they're out.  This is a dynamic that depends a lot on a situation and as I'm not a gun owner (or a woman) I don't want to try to set hard and fast rules.

"You have raised a question that is not only very important, but which I have been wanting to talk about for some time, owing to changes I have made in my own diet and things I have learned.

Let's start at the beginning. America is perhaps the leading Western nation in which a great many people are simultaneously overweight and malnourished. Partly, this is due to a lack of proper education about nutrients and the body's needs, as far as diet, in our schools. Mainly, though, let's face it: People love to eat crap, from fast food, to pork rinds, to everything made from white flour, like white bread and pasta, to cheese, cheese and more cheese.

I am a major cheese lover, myself, but here's the point. That kind of diet consists of what we call empty calories. Yes, you're getting the number of calories you need per day (or more), but they are of little use to your body, as they contain little of the way nutrients your body needs, which is one of the reason you feel hungry all the time--it's not that you need more calories, those constant cravings for more food are your body's way of attempting to get the nutrients it needs.

Salads, steamed vegetables, whole grains, homemade juices, plus supplements you have thoroughly researched so you know you're not getting ripped off and each given supplement actually does something important for your health...this is the way to go.

I have land I can build a substantial garden on, so that I can grow an array of veggies now and during hard times.

Firman 1300 can rotate the motor in my Bissell PowerForce vacuum cleaner on low power setting. On high power setting, generator dies. Still fine with me.

Firman 1300 have a few peculiar aspects, which took me a while to learn:

1) When changing oil, tilt the engine away from yourself and pour slightly more oil, than necessary. Safety cut-off switch need to be submerged at all times. Otherwise, the engine will die when you least expect it.

"Get a valuable skill would be my guess.  If you’re super knowledgeable about herbal medicine, or the only person around who can make something or do something, you are less likely to be traded.  That said, there’s a reason why women usually had a father or brother or husband to protect them.  That’s why Christianity was the beginning of freedom for women in the vast majority of communities (except for like Vikings and Amazons, but they were the exception).  The idea of treating women like people was wildly new.  If you have to choose between a Christian and a non-Christian community, you have better chances with the Christian one.

"546kwh a year is what evergystar gives me at the most efficient full sized fridge.  So 1.5kwh per day average with a 77f or so ambient temp for the uber efficient fridge.  That's 16 hours without counting for inefficiency, standby load or dod.  Now if it's summer and the kitchen gets warm that usage will quickly go up. 10w would be a common standby load for a quality inverter at that size.

Put that all together and you used 12% of the battery just running the inverter for 12 hours. 880wh max left to run the fridge thats drawing 750wh at 77f over 12 hours.  130wh is not much of a margin, far better to expect less and get more as to prepping because what is the OP going to do once it's dead?

"It is best to have knowledge of the main area you will be in and to have multiple paths out of there... depending on where you live.

If I had to leave my area, it wouldn't be because of a tornado or hurricane where I had to go one direction. It would be because of an earthquake.

Also, where I live (southern CA), I have pretty much one way out - north. I can't go south due to a nuclear power plant, although decommissioned it still has nuclear materials there, and also I would need to go past Camp Pendleton. With only one freeway going in that direction, along with 10+ million other people in this area, that is not going to happen.

And, it would be next to impossible for me to go north, as I would be be near Los Angeles county. The freeways are messed up enough as it is. I couldn't imagine with with everybody trying to drive on them.

"I have an EcoFlow setup with 1440 wh of power.  That runs my fridge from 12-14 hours.  Based on those numbers, I think your estimates seem pretty accurate.

A powerbank is great to get your through a short power outage, but it may be their only option.  It doesn't sound like they have a way to safely run a generator.  It also sounds like they are prepping for sporadic, temporary power outages, not extended outages from things like hurricanes.  Based on that, I think that a small power bank could meet their needs.  I'd look at EcoFlow or others with more watt-hours and fewer running watts, as the price for a 1000 wh Jackery seems high and they most likely don't need 1000 watts of starting power.

I prep for hurricanes, so my setup is a power bank with a gas generator to recharge it.  The powerbank gets me through a storm or occasional outage, as I can just plug in my fridge and go to sleep.  If I have an extended outage, I can run the generator during the day to charge the power bank and maintain my fridge, and then run them off the power bank at night.

However, doing something like that in an apartment just isn't practical.  I think OP would do better to prep by getting a powerbank for shorter outages, but plan for the loss of the contents of their fridge in an extended outage.

"Definitive statements can come back to bite people. I think you're right in principle, but...

EMPs - which is just one component of a nuclear war, but arguably the worst - is very unlikely. All the players involved have too much to lose. MAD still works. That said, the US did once nuke another nation, and people are justifiably concerned that someone  could try it again.

Concentration camps in the US happened in my parents' lifetime. Not in mine, and I like to think the US has learned a lesson here. But we've had families forcibly split up at our borders to discourage immigration; some were never reunited, We've had dangerous medical experiments tested on uninformed and unwilling subjects (Tuskegee experiments, MKULTRA and predecessors). We've had ordinary citizens spied on without oversight - for decades and by various organizations. In short, we have a long history of rights violations and even deaths that don't make us look any better than concentration camps.

Civil war in the US is wildly unlikely in any formal sense. States are far too interdependent to allow it and most people, by far, simply aren't that politically motivated. But it's not at all impossible that small groups would engage in acts of mayhem and *call* it civil war, even though it wouldn't have the scope. We've had a violent attempt to disrupt an election within the last decade. And some groups have been openly targeted - night club shootings, harassment campaigns, violence against leaders, riots - to make it obvious that  while full on war isn't in the cards, continued and escalating violence could be.

We don't have clean hands, and we're drowning in rhetoric and disinformation that has and will cause more trouble. The only question is how many dominoes will fall.

You're right that these are all maybes, and climate change is a certainty and already affecting the US. Problems with the grid are predicted to increase (preventable, though) and the US has a clear problem with health care and infrastructure. There are things way more important to prepare for than civil war and EMPs. Like retirement, which is increasingly out of people's reach. And health crisises, which drive a lot of bankruptcy in the US.

So while I'm not into the talk of doomsday, it's really obvious why people have grave concerns about the future. I would not put money on a bet claiming that the US will suffer no major disruption in the next ten years. Crash, no. Misery, possible. Covid taught us that our social systems are poorly designed, and the US could face far worse than Covid supply chain issues someday. 

I used to tell people that prepping for a week would get them though almost anything they'd ever face. I'm up to a month, now. Maybe in a few months I'd be recommending 3 months (which would put prepping out of reach of most of the country.)

So I'm literally trapped in a completely empty house with literally nothing but a single folding chair and a bottle of wine all day until the bed is delivered!

"Money of all kinds.

Dollars, crypto, gold.

People have never needed money.  They have always needed stuff and for most of organized human history, money has been the thing that is used to exchange work for stuff.

But in the event that there was a large scale collapse, that means that stuff is scarce.  I'm not giving you my chickens for money of any kind.

What the hell am I gonna do with Bitcoin?  I probably don't even have internet.  I can only convert it to dollars anyway and we've established that those are worth dick. Actually, on second thought, dick has more value than dollars in this scenario.

Gold might have some more value than other monies, but again, I'm not giving you my chickens for gold.  I can eat a chicken.  I can make two chickens hump and get more chickens.  What the hell can I do with gold.  I don't need gold.  I need stuff.

Gold is only functional in a somewhat functional society.  I need to KNOW that I can trade the gold to someone else in exchange for something I need later.  And that period between when you give me the gold and I go to find another person willing to trade me something I actually need for the gold carries inherent risks.

"I'm going to go on a tangent other people mostly ignored. They're talking about kindling. I'm going to talk about getting the fire started.

Flint and steel (or the better equivalent, ferrosticks) is traditional, but doing it from scratch (knife and flinty rock) is an ordeal.

A 9v battery and steel wool works. Better, a 12v car battery or equivalent. I tried 120V house current once. Don't. (I also put a piece of thin wire across a 660v terminal once, and I'm reasonably certain the resulting *detonation* of the wire would start a fire, but I never did it again.)

There's an equivalent trick with a graphite pencil cut in half longways and 12v applied to two points on the graphite.

If you happen to have potassium permanganate and glycerin on hand, and all I can say is I've found some interesting things in my hobby closet from time to time, who knows how these things happen... it works. Not fast and not neat, but it works.

A good sized fresnel lens can do wonders on a sunny day. A big enough one, and again I had an interesting hobby closet back in the day, will set fire to almost anything, but my favorite was the magnesium strip. Second favorite was a mixture of sugar, potassium nitrate and pool chlorine. Don't breathe. Just run.

You know those cap gun strips kids used to play with? If you get denatured alcohol on the paper...

  
But for tinder, yeah,cotton ball and petroleum jelly. Messy but effective. 

But in Boy Scouts, before a trip, I'd roll up newspaper into a tube a little thicker than my thumb, use pieces of twine around it to hold it rolled up, cut the tube between each piece of twine to get maybe 3 inch lengths, and soak the pieces in wax. Let harden. You light the dangling piece of twine, like a candle wick, to light them. Never failed, even in the rain. For extra fun, roll the newspaper around a mix of sulfur and potassium nitrate, crimp the ends and soak in wax as normal. Give that one to another Boy Scout.

"In Canada it is illegal to carry _anything_ for the intended purpose of self-defence. The exact same bog-standard folding knife carried by two different people could have one charged while the other walks away without a care, depending on how each answers the question.

That’s why both folding knives that I have as EDCs are liberally contaminated with dried fruit juices… while I wash them just before the fruiting season starts so they are appropriately sanitary, I make sure to use them with the last of the apples that I eat straight from the tree - and to not wash them afterwards - to ensure that it is bleedingly obvious I use them for cutting apart fruit.

In particular, someone carrying bear spray or dog spray is going to be _very intensely interrogated_ by the RCMP, because anyone carrying these products on the regular is likely carrying them to use them against another person.",r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMzNJZm1VV3NXS1ZKTW96S2J1V2Rpa2tJR1MxMG1iYUJoYzYwMTJ1Z2prbEpOUl9aTXlEc2x5ZTRXQWl5TFotT29mSmxETkF3bU1rclM4alVtNzh6bnc9PQ==

"The article is basically bullshit.

The author first suggests that some societies do not gender people as men with penises, women with vaginas, and that that means that rape doesn't occurs.  Which is wrong, because however a society genders or does not gender does not change whether a person with a penis can force it into a person with a vagina.

She also spends pages and pages saying that a society, the Gerai, that she lived with values men and women equally, despite admitting that that same society considers men as ""higher"" then women and accords a woman's word only 7/10s that of a man's in a court setting.

She then claims that despite that same society telling her that they had a history as head-hunters, that they are non-violent, and that they were more likely prey for head-hunters than head-hunters themselves.

  
She goes on to claim that the tribe sees each other's sexual organs (male and female) as exactly the same (and argues that rape could not happen between people whose sexual organs are the same), yet also admits that so far as she saw they only had heterosexual sex (odd that if they considered all their sexual organs exactly the same they never, not once to her knowledge, ever had homosexual sex, huh?  Kinda suggests they could tell the difference.)

In the end she shows one thing - that what we call ""rape"" the Gerai would not recognize as ""rape"" but would instead see as basically in inappropriate mis-step in a courting ritual - an expression of ""need"" that was not responded to with ""nurture.""  She also suggests that in her view, people with penises never forcibly insert them into people with vaginas among the Gerai because she never heard of such a thing happening and no one would admit to her that such a thing had happened out of the community of 700 that she lived with.

Well we all know how small communities work and when you have a community full of women who have been trained to not even know of the concept of rape, then it's no surprise that when men force themselves on them (rape them), that they interpret that as nothing but an inappropriate mis-step in a courting ritual, or a non-returned expression of need.  

But that doesn't change the fact that from the very first page, there is strong evidence that Gerai men do sometimes force their penis into vaginas owned by women who do not wan them, and that, whether or not they call it rape, it is, most obviously, by our definitions, rape.",r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRTVBUEVTemRfS3p3d0dYWTU1WTk1OGxvMUNlVW1HWS1PWVk0VHZDaHY0a2dYQ2pjdmVod0dyZFhSRUZrV3lLcUxVMlloRGRXdEFwdktRQ1A2bmRaWXc9PQ==

"They've eaten canned food from 1865, 8+ years is a bit conservative.

Canned food will technically be safe to eat for as long as the can is structurally sound as the process essentially kills all bacteria and creates an environment on which no other bacteria can get it.

Freeze dried & dehydrated food is a similar situation in the sense that bacteria needs moisture to survive. As long as the food is completely dried and the packaging continues to keep all moisture out then it should last indefinitely.

There are also certain foods that just technically last forever as they are just completely stable. Sugar, Salt, Honey, roasted nuts, white distilled vinegar, high percentage alcohol (vodka/whiskey etc) & ghee.

Honestly, if you're looking for a set and forget style situation to stock some kind of bunker or something just go out and buy a metric ton of canned foods that you already eat and supplement with things like bags of dried rice, beans etc. don't forget the dried herbs & powdered milk/potato too.

Also, don't forget about water. Water should be stored bleached and rotated every six months or so.

Fundamentally I can see the sentiment but I don't think swords make sense personally. I means swords are close ranged weapons and I would hate to bring a sword to a gun fight. You could say but what about indoors or confined spaces where ranged weapons don't have an advantage? Swords are not great here either they are too awkward. Also since it's kind of a single purpose item I doubt you would even carry it and actually have it when you actually needed it. I think a large knife or a hatchet/short axe would be more practical and durable if I had literally no other option.,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaY1RrbEdpTUpiSFZQSkExV21Db0J4VGdGYUFwNEdEWnRpZXllUGhpZ2xaQU14UE1Oc056V3lwTWZiM0xYd0pFTU9IRWJFaTg5Z1dPSHItZlMybVgzT1E9PQ==

"In terms of extreme scenarios I think the best advice I've seen so far is to dress masculine, shave your head, hell even make yourself look/smell as unattractive as possible. At a distance it'll be beneficial to look like a man. Try to minimize contact with people, use writing etc instead of 1 to 1 contact.

"It really depends on what you've got prepped and how many you are cooking for.   I've seen (and gotten multiple different cookbooks) over the years.  A lot of it is not particularly useful for this.  Don't get me wrong, it's good to have misc recipes, amounts, times.   But it's rare that I actually have all the items in those recipes, and I usually don't (and wouldn't) eat those recipes anyway.  The vast majority are for full kitchen/best case scenarios, and not low power/camping stove/etc.

I think it's better to actually take cooking courses for the basics (can watch youtube videos as well, search for cooking basics from culinary schools, ton of stuff there).    Once you have the basics, you can usually figure out what to do with what you have with more confidence.  

That said, if you want to prep in advance, there are youtube channels where they go over one bag/box/jar meal preps.  You can plan out a few days in advance and have all your components in one bag in advance.   

Some examples I've seen before (check their channels for more).  These are not 10-15+ year solutions btw.

You wont win in melee vs a spear without another spear of your own unless the spearman fucks up epically or is felled by a congenital heart defect, its just the historical truth of it.

"I think they would serve an important role, like everyone else. I am not too familiar with the scope of training or skillset of an EMT to be completely honest. I can speak much better to the role of a CNA.

CNA training is very basic and focuses on assisting patients with activities of daily living (toileting/changing, bathing, feeding, ambulating), taking vital signs, blood sugars, measuring urine output, etc. They also assist nurses with certain tasks like basic wound care, changing IV dressings, and some places allow them to do phlemobotomy. A nurse, medic, or doctor would be fully capable of performing the role of a CNA, but there is probably a better use of a paramedic, nurse, or doctor's time and knowledge in a SHTF scenario.

So I would say that the CNA skillset would be valuable in the same way they are valuable now- to provide direct care to people in need, and to free up nurses/medics/doctors to provide the more advanced care. Many CNAs (and I would guess EMTs) could be taught the knowledge and skills to do more advanced care over time.

Also, that isn't to say that anyone is ""above"" assisting people with activities of daily living. As a nurse I still regularly help people with toileting, changing, etc but I if I spent all of my time doing that (as it's a never-ending job providing basic care to those who can't do it for themselves) I wouldn't be able to effectively perform my duties as an RN.",r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaUnBLblZxbjN5czdpaUdRYWxPMUJaendyVG9IT0RiM0FQcFBMQmd0QkpvYkZJWE9TVUViSERrTzFNTERsdUlUcFI0eFN0RTdFYUZDT3Y2NjdZX3FoUFE9PQ==

"Just saying as an option - Dwarf or pruned to quasi-dwarf trees can do well in large planters (put lightweight/drainage enhancing things in the bottom of the planter under the soil, make sure you have a/multiple drainage holes in logical placement).

Grow them at your current home, then eventually move them to plant 'for real' at your future home. I have a very nice nectarine tree thriving in a large planter, should I move I can transport it in the planter and figure out placement/allow for adjustment as needed. We have a new plum and peach tree in large planters that are ""my kids' trees"" that they invest the time and care into to make sure they are watered, but my cluster of pots (also have mulberry, pomegranate, many herbs, spicebush, blueberries, a specific highly scented rose that is no longer sold) and those pots allow for extra protection of putting in a sheltered location should the weather go bad (ice storm/hurricane) but also make it really easy to water quickly in a group and when my kids grow up they will have established fruit trees to go with them.

Bonsai can do well in tiny pots and tight pruning. Potted citrus trees are a thing in many places. There was one of the Monty Don shows where he was in...France? and they had large lemon trees that were in boxy portable planters - like an alcohol barrel the container was wood and the binding element (hoops for casks, whatever square hoops are called for these) was metal. This allowed them to forklift/dolly transport them into safety over winter and back out to sun in spring, while also allowing them to replace any rotten wood fairly easily. Additional benefit is that you can fill the edges of your planters with pollinator-friendly plants and herbs and change those out as needed. I put sale-bulbs in mine when they go crazy clearanced at the end of a selling season until I have time/a place set aside in my regular garden beds, and if I don't have time then I have beautiful ""buckets of flowers"" for minimal effort. Costco is my go-to for planters as they have large relatively inexpensive but sturdy ones, all the regular ones that aren't the tough resin go brittle and crack after a year or two in our intense sun). Go with resin, not ceramic as ceramic is prone to breaking, no matter how beautiful.

TLDR - get or make large planters and use those for your fruit trees at your now-home to later move to your future-home.",r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNadHc1NzgzX2lrc09sUzNDQ2YwTlNXT3BKQUlBcVZUeS1iTFRDaFVab3N3cUFpTXRUU1JWUEFJNkFOWjRLZjhmUVFCTE9nVEk1Zi01dEdqTkdrdFgtWFE9PQ==

"Radiation is energy or charged particles ejected from a nucleus at high speed.  You don't filter the radiation.  You filter the materials that emit it.  Chemically, those materials behave exactly the same as their non-radioactive counterparts.  Some materials (like gross fallout particulates) can be filtered via very simple filters (like sand).  Other materials like radium, might need a carbon filter.  Still other radioactive materials like iodine and cesium require more sophisticated removal methods like ion-exchange (which is how a water softener works).  Finally, some materials like Radon, Kenon, and Krypton, cannot be ""filtered out"" because they're inert (part of the noble gasses).  They are removed through agitation and offgassing.  So you see, it's not as simple as ""hey, buy our 'radiation' water filter"".  It really depends on what it is.

In the case of this filter, it looks like they're talking primarily about radium, radon, uranium, etc in water.  You can't really filter ""gross alpha"" or ""gross beta"".  You can filter the materials emitting them.  So if you're thinking about buying this to use after a radiological emergency, nuclear war, etc... I'm not sure it's going to do exactly what you're thinking it will.  It's hard to say because I'd have to see more information on the filter because the information they provide is pretty vague.  If you had high radon or radium content in your drinking water (which some wells do), it might work fine for that.

Might it be ""better than nothing""?   I dunno, maybe?  The general rule with water consumption after a ""nuclear event"" like a war is that if you need water, drink water even if it's contaminated.  Because dehydration will kill you far faster than the radioactive materials will.  So even if it doesn't remove all of the contaminants, maybe it will get some or most of them.  As I said before, fallout is fairly easy to filter, but it's a complex mix of hundreds of different materials fused with soil, sand, seabed, ocean minerals, etc... depending on where it was formed.  So because of that, some of the materials may dissolve off in the water and may not be captured by the filter.  Also, the likelihood of you developing ""acute radiation sickness"" because you're drinking contaminated water, is virtually nil.  If the water is that contaminated, it's likely you're receiving a substantial external dose because you're out of shelter in heavy fallout conditions and will die anyway.

Hopefully some of that info helps.",r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhN0ZoZkg2bExXWG1WcDAteDFReEFsZ3k1aW9YWkFfT1dhRmx1VlBsYXJPeWpBdGpFUjltZWQxN2Y4QlItWHg2cUpZdFN4Z3VUQXpxNmVwcVVlTkNpLVE9PQ==

If you don't want the expense of a traditional water cooler, just get a USB powered pump top from Amazon for under $10, or for about $25, you can get a gravity-fed countertop dispenser.   
I keep 6 full jugs on hand at all times, with 2 more at some state of use on the two top loaded water coolers I have. Top loaded units can dispense without power.   
So I have 10 jugs in total: 6 reserve (30gallon/116l), 2 in use, and 2 that I'll allow myself to have empty before running to get them refilled.

For reference, CDC recommends having 1 gallon per person per day for 2 weeks. It's usually just my wife & I at home, so that's more than recommended for us.

I also live in an area with a lot of lakes, so I have a LifeStraw gravity filter that can clean more than 6 gallons a day, enough for my daughters to bring their boyfriends if we're dealing with a major event.

***No****. Please be advised that the system needs to connect to the internet by ethernet cable when setting up, and needs to be connected to the Internet when in use for full performance*

  
That being said, it does support RTSP streaming, but it is only a stream. Can't control it, make changes to it, or anything else. Cannot access historical footage stored on the device unless you setup an additional NAS to stream to and store the footage on.

"One thing I hear a lot is a small motorcycle or bicycle to get around stranded cars. On one prepper show I saw of a business that set people up for their version of shtf, some guys in an apartment got an inflatable boat to get out of the city, as that was the fastest way, and it fit in their apartment. They sold them baseball bats to fight to the river, if they had to lol, because no guns in that city. I know it was just a show, but I'm brain storming. You want money for a motel after you get far enough away, maybe cash and a hidden card in case you get robbed for the cash. Some water, maybe a food brick or something so you don't get too lightheaded. A water filter would be good, if you will have water to filter on the way. First aid kit for bigger problems, like gauze, stop bleed stuff and like an Israeli bandage,  not just a bunch of bandaids. There might not be help available for a bit.  Not a whole camping set up, but like a waterproof blanket or bag and tarp maybe if it might take more than a day to get somewhere else. I got this foam blanket with silver on one side that's pretty warm for its size and weight that might be good for that. If all you have to do is get a couple days away from it, it's way different than running off to live in the woods.

"I live in a rural area but some of these concepts are the same. I have a bug out bag and plan on having to do a fair amount of running through the woods. So, I keep a couple of energy bars in my bag and I can even eat those while running. You're going to burn a lot of calories all at once so you're going to be very hungry within hours and this is such a simple way to solve that. Later I can deal with how I feed myself the next day. 

In your bag should also be a good flashlight with new batteries - you may be running at night which is hard to do if you can't see the ground. You might even prefer a headlight. I also suggest an easy to reach can of bear spray just to get people away from you. Not in your bag you may need to get that while running. I can actually swap my bag around so it's on my chest and in that position it's easy for me to draw my gun which is hidden on the side facing my chest, it's a holster on the outside of the bag.

"List of various ideas I have collected over the years, so what you choose of this list is of course dependent on your actual living situation:i

Wet wipes/Babywipes for washing, no showering.

Collect rain water or get water from the nearest river in buckets for flushing your toilet, or get a bag of cat""sand"" and  park a plastic bag in the toilet. Throw some catsand over the stool after use. Tie a knot when full and throw in the trash or bury the contents far away from food producing areas. Gross, but dying of thirst is no comparison.

Try to use paper plates and plastic cutlery to avoid washing up. When you have to wash up, re-use the water as many times as possible, collect it and then use it to flush the toilet.

Use a cylindrical thingy/pipe to lead the water from washing your hands into a bucket for flushing the toilet. You can cut up a plastic bottle and shape it as you ned for this job.

Air out clothes instead of washing them.

I think the first signs will be economic and political. If you look through history economic issues become political issues which escalate into much worse issues as pandering and corrupt politicians propose simple solutions to complex problems that actually make things worse. When these solutions don't work they typically double down or blame corrupt and evil elements within that society to deflect away from their own ineptitude. Look for things like.... A declining standard of living. Growing wealth inequality. Corruption. Inflation.  Government debt and money printing. Political polarization and political unrest. Increased use of propaganda and lies from government sources. Populous leaders promising simple solutions.

""Do you need a Global Needle?

Simple answer: not unless you plan to travel near the poles, and even then, you can just hold your compass at an angle and verify the needle is freely balanced.

Due to the shape of Earth’s magnetic field the “pull” so-to-speak, on your compass needle is not always evenly “pitched”, and changes as you approach the poles.

To counter this, global needles relocate the ferrous part nearer the fulcrum, and have plastic north and south “pointers” instead.

With a standard compass, the ends of the needle are interacting with earth’s field. So, where the Earth’s field is pulling at too “steep” an angle, it can unbalance a standard needle.

In a global compass, it’s near the center to reduce that effect.""

Normal compasses work perfectly fine in either hemisphere.

The only thing you ever have to do is adjust for declination.

"RE: EMP's and Faraday Cages (Copied and pasted from another forum)

Although EMP can be produced by several different methods,  the only man-made kind that is capable of causing widespread damage is produced by detonating a nuclear weapon at a very high altitude (typically referred to as ""HEMP""):

Every other form of EMP weapon is either a mere laboratory curiosity, or has a range too small to be useful against anything other than small, specific military targets (some examples of these other non-nuclear ""EMP"" missiles and ""e-bombs"" are described [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_pulse#Non-nuclear_electromagnetic_pulse_.28NNEMP.29) and [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-electronics_High_Power_Microwave_Advanced_Missile_Project)).

So, unless you happen to live next door to an extremely high-value military target, HEMP is the only kind of EMP weapon you're ever likely to be within range of.

HEMP does its damage by inducing a very brief, high-voltage spike in electrical devices. This spike can be strong enough to burn out wiring,  ""punch through"" the thin semiconductor layers in transistors,  diodes and computer chips,  or cause the software in computer-controlled devices to go haywire.

HEMP energy is mostly concentrated at the low end of the radio frequency spectrum - i.e., [well below 100 MHz](http://www.arrl.org/files/file/Technology/tis/info/pdf/88615.pdf):

Because of this trait, only fairly long electrical conductors (i.e., AC power lines, phone/cable/internet lines, big antennas, etc.) are capable of ""receiving"" a HEMP pulse in any significant strength. Physically short conductors make very inefficient ""antennas"" for receiving the low frequencies produced by the HEMP pulse, so they do not generate much of a voltage spike.

In devices that aren't connected to any long conductors, little or no voltage spike is generated due to HEMP, and so **the device is unlikely to be damaged**. Most small electronic devices (i.e., cell phones, portable radios, PDAs, laptop computers, digital wristwatches, flashlights, electronic combination locks on safes,**red dot sights**, etc.) would fall into this category - The few inches (or fractions of an inch) of conductors present in these devices is simply too short to intercept any significant amount of the HEMP pulse, which means that no spike is generated within them that is sufficient to cause damage.

This also means that ""Faraday Cages"" aren't of much use against HEMP, because just about any device that is small enough to fit inside a practical Faraday Cage is too small to be affected by HEMP anyway.

The other, naturally-occurring kind of EMP is produced by solar flares (or ""geomagnetic storms""), and is even lower-frequency than HEMP - which means that a conductor needs to be [many miles long](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetically_induced_current)  to be affected by it. Some examples: High-tension power transmission lines, gas pipelines, undersea cables (copper, not fiber), and - back in the old days - telegraph lines. Other, shorter conductors are mostly unaffected.

Solar flares [do not produce any of the fast-rising, high-voltage ""E1"" or ""E2"" spikes that HEMP produces in electrical conductors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_electromagnetic_pulse#E3), so personal electronics are not affected by it. (Note that satellites can be damaged by solar flares, since they're outside the part of the earth's atmosphere that provides some shielding from solar radiation. Radio signals can also be affected, particularly in parts of the radio frequency spectrum that normally rely on bouncing signals off  some layer in the earth's atmosphere to make them travel long distances.)

"When your family is in immediate danger like that, it makes sense to choose them first, job be damned. You can replace a job, but not a human being. 

As to your last line, I’ve been in both short-term violent civil unrest and military invasion (reasonably far from the front, though) situations and people kept working during both. I’m self-employed and work from home so it was (physically) easy for me, but businesses were still open and utilities were mostly still on, so people definitely were still working. It was actually kind of surreal. Also, you can see right now people still work even with a war on.

Basically, if you want to keep your job, you probably have to keep going. If you’re self-employed, you keep working as long as you can and still need money. But stop when you believe continuing to work puts your or your family’s safety at serious risk. Life > money. It’s an extremely case-by-case decision, though.

"I'd say for your question, the best source is the news.

I'm not from the US so I don't know about the weather part, but I would guess major anticipated events get at least some coverage, so on that front, if you pay attention, you should be aware. If that's not the case there are also weather alerts apps that you can install on your phone, and probably some that can cover multiple locations so that you could also be aware of how things are going for your relatives.

The second one in my opinion is civil unrest and overall people being dumb idiots. For that second one I think the media is even more important : some stories blow up and some don't. Why did George Floyd create such a massive reaction while there has been many stories like this one ? Overall it's simply because many people get aware of a specific story and react to it. By watching the news, you'll be able to know at the same time as whoever might react to it to do dumb shit. It's true for riots and looting, but it's also true for big fires for example, empty stores and gas stations or things like this.

"It sounds like the author (was it an AI?) got confused between EMP and CME halfway through. Specifically, CMEs generate low frequency energy, but HEMPs have been described as ""DC to daylight"" and other sites talk about hundreds of Mhz. At that point a quarter wave antenna is a few inches, well within the range of copper traces on circuit boards. And depending on the circuit, you don't need to induce much voltage to do damage - modern processors have been known to lose their minds at overvoltages of 1v. The faster the processor, generally more fragile the electronics.

This isn't to say that commercial Faraday cages are any good. Most don't tell you what frequencies they were tested at.

With so many unknowns, the right answer is a Faraday *shield*, not a cage. A proper shield means you don't have to worry about what the actual frequency range is, and it can be built with a metal trash can, tight metal lid and conductive tape to seal it up. Or, if you're really careful, wrap your items in multiple layers of metal foil, leaving no tears, holes or gaps.

I'll point out, as I always do, that shielding your electronics really isn't all that relevant. A series of EMP attacks on the US means the grid is coming down hard - substation transformers exploding, even power lines melting. Irrespective of what other electronics die, this is a long term death for the grid, because without the grid you can't manufacture replacement parts. You're also, it needs to be pointed out, at the start of a nuclear war.  About the only electronic device I can think of of any use is a standalone, solar powered computer with your reading material on it. Anything using radio (wifi, cell system, ham) is probably gone because it was hooked to antennas and power lines when the EMP hit. So put whatever you want in your trash can Faraday shield, but it may not have much to talk to after the war. Also, don't open the trash can until the war is definitely over - you don't know the EMPs have stopped until then.",r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnck1LNXB5eHduRWNpMlRTaXFBTDhBczZrakZtM09XSDZoX3NMLXZNSWtkVHRibjJRYnNlTVFLLUlQdDB4aXJySlY4MGlYa3diYnJWQXJpXzJLT2Q3cFE2eUwzamMyemVIa1JBTTZWZFBQYnc9

"I ordered cheese making supplies and I will be getting my canner this week. I hope to start to make my own cheese which in the long run will save a fair bit of money. cheese is unbelievably and ridiculously expensive here. It's a preserved fermented food that keeps well for fairly long periods of time and can also be frozen. If the freezer goes out then thawing it won't hurt it. I am using the freezer for fermented foods as the foods are not harmed if the freezer thaws and it's a compact efficient use of space. The fewer store bought products we use the better off we are. Meats will be canned when they're on sale ( Christmas, Thanksgiving) 

Right now we are dealing with an immanent reduction of income  due to retirement and increasing inflation which is being covered up and mostly due to corruption or artificially induced to support new carbon tax laws. It's not really a SHTF but more of a slow burn down of the economy. 

 I've got to work on the evacuation stuff soon but need to save up a few thousand for the trailer hitch equipment and a decision about the car we need to make. I don't want to mess with the wiring harness of the car we have if we are going to get a bigger more powerful car next year when I retire. We'll use a light camper in addition to the back and bike packing equipment and start working on that end so we have some flexibility if we have to face a long term evacuation. Most of the fire/ storm evacuations lasted 2 weeks.",r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnVU1tWEgybVR6M2c2RGhGYUVVeXc5Mkd6YmQ5RldqVTQ1aDNmUHc1NUVRS2FKWUNJSkl2X2VMNWJOcHhpaDdobUIwRnNRV3A0QTl4RHVIN04tajA2MEtCNEdCSmlPM21oaG5jTlVNWml3QUE9
