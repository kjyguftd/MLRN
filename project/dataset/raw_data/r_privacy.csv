* If it's a service that you don't log into, then there's ways to counteract this.

"I also am really tired of this happening despite running a secured network, blocking broadcasts, blackholing adservers and telemetry, etc.  Almost as tired as I am of seeing people's experience of the thing be dismissed.

I would prefer some way to capture the remote's communications so we could be able to show how much is or isn't being captured. 

The remote's behavior is far, far worse if using youtube.  It seems to listen for every sound it can for the purposes of timing interruptions at the least. It picked up on video game noises one day and hasn't let go of that little discovery since.  Its behaviors combine to approximate, idk, a tattletale child KGB asset in congress during McCarthyism.

Maintaining data privacy in 2024 is like physical fitness. You have to put in a lot of training (Research) to get a beautiful result. Many will point and talk sh\\*t, but secretly wish *they* had the discipline to maintain such fine control over their *body* (the Digital Footprint).

Once you figure out Facebook and TikTok aren't real places, that using office productivity apps *doesn't* require strangers to upload your contacts list, and that You, Google, and Samsung all together sharing one phone is unwise\\*.\\* Two entities *must* go to preserve the *minimum* of data privacy.

As reported by many reputable news outlets, they were anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers who, at the start of the COVID pandemic, illegally occupied a downtown residential neighbourhood for weeks in their trucks, ran them 24/7 and polluted the air that residents breathed, honked truck horns 24 hours a day, lit fires in the street, harassed residents, especially minorities and those wearing masks.

They also illegally blocked major trade routes between Canada and the U.S. causing economic hardship to many ordinary citizens just trying to live their lives.

To be fair to OP, it is standard ptractice to terminate TLS at Cloudflare (or any CDN) generally sites will re-encrypt for the trip from the CDN to their own servers but not always.

If you are looking for **only** privacy then you probably should use any distro that you like then opt out of their automated data collection.

"I know it is highly unlikely that anything will change. But things have changed before that people thought would never change.

We would need to start a movement. We would need developers and users to both be on board. Both groups are highly unlikely to get involved. 

Developers could come up with competitors to ""products"" that make money by selling our data. If they are doing that much work, they're not going to want to do it for free. But let's assume they'll do it for free... Even then, users are not going to want to change. They don't want to have to learn something new. Developers aren't going to want to work on a browser that they know nobody is ever going to use. 

I thought of another way... But still, nobody's going to do it. The companies could start charging people instead of making money by selling data. They could say we have a free plan... You pay for it by giving us your data. If you don't want to give us your data, here's a paid plan. Existing companies aren't going to do this unless people stop using their product.

3rd idea Create laws that stop companies from selling data. They would probably say all they have to do is put it in the TOS... If you don't want your data to be sold, don't sign up.

"This. I really do not want to come across as elitist or ""above normal people"" but OP you have to understand this. 

The vast majority of people do not care about the world outside their little bubble. And most certainly not for abstract political concepts such as the merits of privacy, the present and future dangers of a surveillance state and the risks of our hyper networked landscape. 

History shows this. The vast majority of people will go along with egregious violations of rights and oppression either through active support or worse complete apathy.

The best you can do is keeping raising your concerns in a sane and non pushy manner. The occasional news article about big things happening regarding privacy, security and surveillance does wonders. 

People only really care when things impact them. Instead of talking about the surveillance state, the architecture of totalitarianism that is being built and how Big Tech weilds far to much power, get them to care about smaller things.

For example I have gotten a family member to use a password manager and firefox/ brave after a data breach affected them. Another friend I converted to Signal. I have another group of friends that follow my blog where I post about privacy, more due to them wanting to support me than caring about the content but it's still something.

"I am eternally grateful for having been paranoid enough from the start to never post face photos to any online service. I mean, the fuckers have managed to link everything I do together anyway and a portion of my social network (major platforms at least, mainly ""social"" media and common email addresses and contacts etc). Then there is every arsehole I've ever known who has uploaded my contact details to big data companies through invasive app permissions without my consent. And everyone who has posted photos of me to social media without my consent. I have to my utter disappointment uploaded face photos to dating app companies for verification and recently fucking SeaWorld to buy an online yearly pass (waste of money, I hate the place and I don't trust them). Simply having a drivers licence in my country means facial biometrics have been added to a govt database and I don't trust their data security at all haha (I know people who work for govt departments responsible for citizen data and yeah no). And now they want to force everyone to use a digital national ID and centralise all medical records etc. Also CCTV everywhere recording me. Services requiring voice print verification (wtf guys). I even found myself in some serious legal trouble when I was much younger and the company responsible for data storage and security accidentally posted my full name and details on their public website in an advertisement for their services, massively breaching privacy laws (unfortunately a family member discovered it and threatened them and didn't get any evidence otherwise I would own a house FML). There is no escape from this shit. And what is already out there, despite my best efforts is out of my control. Not that it's worth giving up. I'm holding on to every last piece of privacy I have they will have to claw my 'consent' out of my cold dead hands. But it's increasingly (already totally) full blown state level adversary, spy level opsec just to keep anything private, with all of the inconvenience and social exclusion that comes with it (that's been the main downfall for me, I held out as long as I could but I ended up sacrificing personal opsec for social inclusion and much desired convenience and connection and paid a price I'm not happy with, a price that seems wholly unimportant to most which I'll never understand). I'm currently assessing where I'm at and the work that will be required to completely abandon anything that links to my current footprint within my capacity, which I will do, just building up the spoons to map out a schema of contextual identities and start thinning out what's already on the playing field to the best of my ability, but have to maintain all of the life shit which takes up most of my bandwidth like everyone else trying to keep themselves from drowning. But as I've alluded to can have all the personal opsec in the world but can't control other people. My current housemate/landlord has a ring doorbell, security cameras out the back and everything connected to fucking WiFi she's going full on smart home like I need to use an app to turn the fucking lights on and off. 

Anyway. That's my rant for the morning haha. Ditch the competition they are farming you like cattle. Tell them to go fuck themselves and move on.

"If you were actually unknowingly, unintentionally running even just TeamsViewer, AnyDesk, and AmmyAdmin simultaneously, you would be very, very hacked. Pretty sure even an AV that hasn’t been updated since 2015 would flag some evidence of intrusion somewhere. And like I said, STP, ULV, and LIT aren’t widely known acronyms. They could refer to variants of specific malware, but it would be pointless to disclose those tags without the rest of name.

Detection is always either too sensitive (leading to more false positives) or too insensitive (leading to more false negatives).  

The more risk adverse approach (that banks prefer) is to tune it to be too sensitive and then manually sort legitimate findings from FP. But that is a lot more time consuming and skill demanding and can lead to alert fatigue where detections get ignored. It’s an overall worse user experience, just occasionally preferable since a single false negative can destroy a system while many false positives can be managed.       

(Unless a false positive causes someone to throw their device out a window. Then it has led to a full compromise of the system anyway.) 

The shared responsibility model here is a bit ill-defined tbh. The bank can’t validate their detection without access to your system. You can’t validate it either without access to their alert. ",r/privacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZNG1yRTZJcUFMbE1zOHlsRUhfOENiSnNKOGk5Z1RlNHloVE4xRm5WR2UzMGI0dW91Y2psekVUNzVHM1ZMMktJZUlwVnZqLUQ5RDRndVQ0Ti02MnZSclE9PQ==

"When people ask for privacy focused something they usually mean avoiding mass data collection on them.

The sad news though is that one can only minimize it to a certain extent but it's impossible to completely avoid.

Tl;Dr you use your computer to consume online services and it's impossible to consume a service without exposing your usage history/patterns to a service provider that may share your data with whomever.

OS is only one of many things that may leak your data outwards. Others are, for example:
* ISP
* VPN provider
* apps like your browser or Zoom
* websites
* your phone, its OS, apps, and mobile operator
* your smart TV with all the streaming services subscriptions
* other people's devices in your household and office

"Android and iOS are privacy nightmares.  Rule 14 exists I think so that every mobile-related post doesn't devolve into the subject and instructions for your device as it's an in-depth subject with its own respective subreddits.  Nobody is getting banned for saying the name of a private OS or pointing someone in that direction.

Speaking of which there are some privacy OS foundations that sell hardware.  Although being concerned about voiding your warranty should be one of the least of your concerns.  If you have purchased/received your device through your carrier or using their insurance policies for replacements there is little concern about issues due to rooting or flashing your device.  There are E-fuses on devices but despite that and all the hyperbole and fear I've sent in many devices for both warranty and insurance claims over the years with custom ROMs/ boot loaders/ recoveries and all obviously rooted without issue or complaint.  I've seen people flash them back to stock but in my experience, it has never been necessary.  Also, without getting too far down the rabbit hole (see rule 14) not all privacy OS/ROMs are Android-based, and the non-android flavors are arguably the most private and secure IMHO.

Hardware from these AIO privacy phone firms isn't bleeding edge but that isn't necessarily a bad thing in a few ways.  Newer privacy concerns are arising now as the latest Bluetooth LE specifications communicate even when the device is off and is tracked in databases such as Google's Find My Device network as well as Apple's find my iPhone.  In a similar vein mobile devices will soon be shipping with satellite radios so big bro can track your phone just about anywhere.",r/privacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZR3Z3UXFLZUVuRXAtZjNHTnF1UGtBWFZKZ2NKd19tb3pyYndxUEFMcGF2YjFLX1N0eVVkRUx4TTBpa1BmeW9wRU12Y1Q5RmF0dDZvdkJrMDVOQ1o4SFE9PQ==

however if there is a linux version, lets say for example thunderbird. configuration files will work since it is the software that created/knows the filecontent id give it a solid 99% of success.

">Is privacy on mobile really that bad?

no, its that my data is my private stuff and its not for you to take. its like me going into your home when youre out. i write and log all data from around your house. cc number, contacts, medical records, your preferences, and then I leave and see the data to ad brokers. its the exact same thing except in digital format as the origin vs analog.

"""The purpose"" is not a single purpose.  Password + TOTP, even if TOTP is in the same password manager as the TOTP, improves against some threats.  That's what matters, what threat models are mitigated by measures.  Password + TOTP makes it so that if the password is compromised, the TOTP still protects the account.  That means, if someone steals the password, phishes the password, or the site's password database is compromised, etc., the account stays secure because of the existence of TOTP.  Also, a lot more people are likely to start using their crappy password + TOTP, even if they don't switch to a password manager fully. There was a solid number of years where I was using my basic password + TOTP in an app (Authy at the time).  

You are correct that some scenarios are not mitigated by having TOTP if TOTP is not stored securely.  A compromise of my password manager is still bad since it leaks my password and my TOTP. 

But I think the distinction between ""something you know, something you have, and something you are"" is a bit arbitrary.  At the end, everything translates into 1's and 0's, so everything is at the end of the day 'something you know' or something that is knowable.  FIDO2 passkeys are used to sign challenges.  The passkey itself is just a very very very long 'something you know'.  Locking 'something you know' into a TPM and using hardware safety measures to prevent access without biometrics doesn't make a private encryption key ""something you have"" instead of ""something you know"" - it's ""something you know"" but that you don't have personally memorized, which is saved somewhere that protected by biometrics. 

Biometrics also aren't ""something you are"".  They are ""something you are"" which is transformed by sensors into zeros and ones, which is something that is knowable.  Let's say my face scan, done with apple equipment, results in 001001 as the scan result.  So then the scan result of 001001 is used as a password to access the passkey (which is also something you know).  

That being said, it's less about things being 'something you know' or 'something you are', but rather having ways of storing credentials that are not likely to be compromised at the same time. 

For better security, something like a Yubikey is great.  It's a separate hardware module that is intentionally difficult to copy / clone, and while it is still 'something you know' (private encryption keys) stored on something that is difficult to extract from, making it much more like 'something you have' than a lot of other options out there.  

At the end of the day, computers can't interact with 'something you have' or 'something you are'.  They only interact with information (bits), so what you have and what you are needs to be converted to data somehow.  Since that process is not exact (i.e. it won't read the same exact values every time on fingerprints or face scans), there needs to be some probability matching in the validation, and that means that the credentials need to be protected by the hardware and software of the thing that is storing them.  And it is still possible to brute force biometrics (since at the end it's data, it isn't 'something you are') https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/05/brute-forcing-a-fingerprint-reader.html . 

But, by hardening the storage of these things, it reduces the threat surface.  And that's what matters.",r/privacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNackRjZEVrcVVwaDhkcDNMVzh4eWk3S1BIUnNKS2Jkc2tMWG9ZOTlIaUVpaF8xcEVralVrdlVsdElzYTBQb01ITVpWSHJVVmNVZ21YRGNBZHdiVlZ2T3c9PQ==

"Look into the Snowden leaks if you want to learn about things the government uses on everyone. The one positive about things like Pegasus is that it's in horrible monster companies like NSO's best interest to keep their exploits as closely guarded secrets as possible so they can continue to profit off of them. If an exploit becomes too widespread it is far more likely to be patched out. 

This is why you will often hear privacy advocates talking about building a threat model.

"the strangest thing just happened 

i was using chatGpt for some coding help, it gave a bunch of code and used it, then i made some modifications to the code, at the same time i kept going back to chatGPT to tell it to make improvement on the code, 

there were a few lines of code that i changed to make it easier to test the code for my self, i made a very small change 

basically i changed a line from using some variable to use just a set number 25 in this case, and i changed another value to be just the word ""Hello"", 

i was using the chatGPT code in tinkercad for arduino 

i asked chatGPT to make some modifications to the code but never told it that i used these specific values and never asked it to change the way the code was tested yet it gave me the same exact values that i used in tinkercad 

it might be my conspiracy hat on, but it is one hell of a coincidence that it used these exact values when i never told it about it

"Windows 11 should already randomize your MAC on new connections as long as you have “MAC Randomization” on in settings. If you want to connect with your host’s true MAC, turn this setting off. 

Another way to obfuscate your host’s MAC would be to disable the internal WiFi and use an external NIC. This way, you are giving up the MAC of the external NIC. 

Alternatively, get a travel router (like a GLinet) that allows you to randomize or specify a specific MAC for that router.

"""App that you don't have to log in, that you can subscribe to subreddits and also have homepage? I don't want to post or comment on anything, just read.""

Not an app, and sometimes it gets janky, but libreddit is a reddit front end similar to how free tube is a youtube front end.

How to:

[libreddit.kavin.rocks](http://libreddit.kavin.rocks) is the site

To build a feed, just add subreddits to the end of the url, first one gets a / r / sub name and everything after is separated by a + sign. Save this url as a bookmark.

for example, [libreddit.kavin.rocks/r/privacy+fossdroid](http://libreddit.kavin.rocks/r/privacy+fossdroid) would give you a homepage with those 2 subs, can be sorted by hot/new/etc. It is super clean and fast, no java I believe. You can't comment or up/down vote. And occasionally the instance (kavin.rocks) will get janky for a few hours and not work. In that case you can just use another libreddit instance, just replace the part of your url in front of the / r / .

edit:

here is a list of active instances, you can use any of them to set up your feed, I just started using kavin rocks because he also does a bunch of the piped/libretube shit.

[https://stats.uptimerobot.com/mpmqAs1G2Q](https://stats.uptimerobot.com/mpmqAs1G2Q)

also, it appears they call it redlib now instead of libreddit, same interface it appears.

"""Is privacy on mobile really that bad?""

Yes, it is that bad. Though Android can be re-educated through a specific skill, when learned, will allow the root user the ability to fight Big Data with better tools, or customize the hell outta the device. Or both.

""Same With Rooting""

Nothing is *bad*...with practice. Been rooting since 2016. It's waaaaay easier now.

Root can be *un-rooted* for service or to sell the device, making 'Void Warranty' claims the strawman of those who never rooted *anything ever*.

""I don't have anything to hide but i don't have anything I want to share either""

As an individual...nothing you *ever* said/did is *ever* anyones' business EVER unless YOU say so. Get like *that.* Live like *that.* No one does anything on principle anymore?

No one here wishes to be 100% anonnymous, just massively less visible to Big Data. That goal is within reach with some un-learning and discipline.

""So are these people just paranoid or they are right and unfortunately you can't have privacy on android unless you go to the path of rooting and rule 14?""

They are not paranoid, they are *lazy.* So lazy, they would happily trade small personal facts of themselves in order to exist in ficticious spaces, rather than block all that creepy-ass sh\\*t as soon as they heard about it.

So lazy, they will ignore, then pretend what we discuss in this forum is not happening, or are the fever dreams of anti-tech zealots. Where? Boo!!!

"As creepy as this is it's nothing. Not even worth reporting on- this is one person who took a bunch of photos.  
For normal size, let's assume high-quality JPEG images, which are typically used for everyday photography and online use. These can range from 2 MB to 10 MB per image, depending on the resolution and compression.

Let's use an average of 5 MB per image for this calculation:

* Average file size: 5 MB per image
* Total size for 2,000 images: 2,000×5 MB=10,000 MB2,000 \\\\times 5 \\\\, \\\\text{MB} = 10,000 \\\\, \\\\text{MB}2,000×5MB=10,000MB

So, the total size for 2,000 normal-sized high-quality JPEG images would be approximately **10,000 MB** (or 10 GB).  
10 GB is fucking nothing in today medium. So why bother making a story out of this?

"First thing to remember is you are uninteresting. No one is brute-forcing or otherwise progressively attacking your accounts to gain access. Your most likely attack vesctor is a databreach of a website you use. The key here is to use a unique password for eaxh website such that a databreach doesn't give someone your password to another service.

Best approach: Make up a word (I like to combine multiple swearwords into one). Then create a nickname for the website you use. Made up word, followed by your nickname is the password for that site.

Boom, you now only need to remwmber one password and you have a trivial way to remember a a unique password.

"For someone new to Linux, Proton or dual booting is going to be way less of a headache. Gaming VMs need access to your physical GPU, USB ports, audio devices, etc. The setup process uses PCIE passthrough, requiring being comfortable with CLI and a fair amount of libvirt configuration.

"In general, you need some form of scientific confirmation of a body’s identity for legal proceedings.

The government lies about not being able to access encrypted cell phones. They pushed this during the 2015 San Bernardino shooting.

They were able to break into the device later on by already existing tools. The same thing will happen here.

When the government says, ""We can't access this data."" What they really mean is, ""We want an easier way to get in these devices without spending man-hours on it."" They push for more powers and tools during a crisis, then that will be given to every police agency across the country for the smallest potential crimes.

"There’s something terrifying about Google deploying AI across all their services.

Connecting dots, building profiles, and generating detailed reports of highly private data in seconds. The “system” knows you better than you know yourself. 

It’s far too much power for a single company. This shouldn’t exist.

If it’s not properly sandboxed, and the wrong person gets uncontrolled access to this AI system… the evil possibilities are endless. ChatGPT, but with everyone’s most personal data as the data set.

I don’t think most people can imagine the kind of prompts someone with malicious intentions could ask that system. From politicians, to horrific criminals. Think something like: “generate a list of people in [insert city] who…”. Let your imagination run wild. That’s absolutely terrifying.

"It doesn't have to be your siblings, it could be anyone in your extended family.  I believe they caught the killer by testing the DNA they found on the crime scene from the cold case files on an ancestry site like 23andme.  Then the site came up with some distant relatives who also used the service.  From there law enforcement were able to build out an extensive family tree, and through deductive reasoning determine that only one person in the family was living in Califonia during the time of the murders.  They then tracked him going about his everyday business.  And when he finished drink a soda and threw it away in the trash, they retrieved the cup and straw and swabbed for DNA.  The DNA indeed ended up matching the cold case DNA, and that's how they caught him.

So there was actually a lot of detective work involved.  But certainly testing the DNA on ancestry was what broke the case open.

"Thanks that makes a lot of sense.

So is words better than non words?

For example if you forgo spaces you have a non dictionary word : ""thisismypassword"" as opposed to "" this is my password""? Does that increase the difficulty or does the one non-word dictionary render it less effective than multiple spaced out words?

So in essence more words, and combining alphanumeric and symbols such as ""@nd the car jumped ca$h""  would be the ultimate strength?

"> Mozilla and their partner behind this technology, the ISRG (responsible for Let's Encrypt), could trivially collude to compromise your privacy.

So can VPN providers with the government. Should we stop using VPNs and let all websites fingerprint us using our IP?

So can Proton and Tutanota by the way. So can Signal (by distributing a malicious app update). Should all these disappear from privacyguides ?

This is actually a decent compromise that should help Mozilla be less dependent on Google. Shitting on them for needing money is just childish, especially when the arguments are bad.

Having a framework in place might help shape the browser market. When Google comes out with its crap like FLoC and AMP, there are no alternatives. Now, there may be a decent one to compete with FLoC and that is endorsed by a big player. If Apple gets interested and joins, maybe Google will as well.

Also, having a framework in place means that companies don't need teams of lawyers to ensure that their custom tracking is legal, and don't need to worry about getting fined if they do a poor job.

"Shady data brokers pop up all the time, usually scraping their data from other sites or breaches, which could easily have your SSN. The legitimate data sellers may not sell your full SSN, but they have it. The absurd part is they will often obscure a few digits in an output, but another data seller will also have it and obscure digits. But the first one will obscure the beginning of your SSN, and the other data seller will obscure the end. Access to both grants you someone’s full SSN, so it’s a bit of a joke to obscure it at all. At this point, I have accepted my SSN is available to be found. Cloaked probably just gathered it from one of many sources out there.

I haven’t tried Cloaked yet, but most of these companies that “automatically” remove you can do more harm than good. They just blast your information at the opt-out email address or web portal for these brokers without actually looking to see if you are in there.

In the past year, Google did something like this with their image-generating AI, secretly injecting words into people's prompts on the back-end in order to encourage their model to produce more people of color. They did this because their model was heavily biased toward disproportionately portraying white people when prompts didn't otherwise specify ethnicity, but their ham fisted ""fix"" led to the AI changing the ethnicity of historical figures, which resulted in even more bad press for them.

I used to transfer numerous archives over USB and every so often I'd end up with a single flipped bit. The only thing I can imagine is cosmic rays.

Should be very easy to catch, but for whatever reason Veracrypt (at least back then) seemingly did not perform any kind of validation.

Alert your medical providers that your mom may call pretending to be you to get your information, etc. so they can put a password and any other security measures in place.

If organized and able and willing enough. Consider leaving the temptation to stalk you open so that you have legal recourse and evidence so they will let you do a restraining order but that may mean they will know your place of residence.

Alert your school if in college and your work as well and tell them whats happening so if anyone calls asking if you work there /when you work/etc or ask info in any way about you, they have a plan and answer in place to protect you. Also set up a new email for all of these changes. Leave the old email as a dummy email. Get your license plate and drivers license number changed if possible. Remove your face and palms from any social media and detag yourself or ask people to remove pictures of you. They will eventually try to image search for your face if they are persistent enough. Talk to a lawyer also to help you do this process in the right order. Keep in mind if they have the resources and desperation to try and find you, you don't want a private detective looking for you either.

"One Monday morning in May, I woke up and grabbed my cell phone to read the news and scroll through memes. But it was out of cell service. I couldn’t make calls or texts.

That, though, turned out to be the least of my problems.

Using my home Wi-Fi connection, I checked my email and discovered a notification that $20,000 was being transferred from my credit card to an unfamiliar Discover Bank account.

I thwarted that transfer and reported the cell phone issues, but my nightmare was just starting. Days later, someone managed to transfer $19,000 from my credit card to the same strange bank account.

"…. What?! Lmao. Sorry for laughing but sheesh. Youve got it all wrong.

Follow standard practice oft mentioned in this subreddit in order to not get hacked, but listen, dude. Hardly anyone in a “bad neighborhood” is going to running around scanning BT signals looking for anything except the device they want… and your BT range isnt gonna be crazy far. Getting hacked and having something stolen are two very different scenarios, what exactly are you worried about? Serious question, post is ambivalent. 

Like, put yourself in the shoes of someone who’s trying to find a nice TV to steal. Ask yourself how easy it would be to achieve that, and remember that most people don’t have the tech savvy to do what youre suggesting. Also… Try it. Scanning for bluetooth? Youre gonna need tools to determine signal strength without looking really suspicious/obvious.

Dude, they’re gonna look for whatever home looks like itd be easy to case, having no idea what’s in there. Or maybe they have an idea because someone who lives there gets tons of packages and is always really well dressed/nice shoes/headphones/jewelry/symbols of status. 

You should be more concerned about your packages and street smarts, because it doesn’t seem like you have any. It’s super uncommon for technological crimes beyond cc skimmers and the like to occur in a “bad neighborhood” man. 

Before someone hits me with the stupid antenna extender to steal car BS, bring forward statistics on how common that is. Actual numbers from a reliable source. It is NOT common. 

Carry a knife. Know where youre going and/or at least look like you do. Lock your doors and windows. Don’t leave anything visible in your car, and I mean anything. Don’t look people directly in the eye, greet your neighbors while passing by if they dont look pissed.

"I personally don’t use them. I have several phone numbers memorized for friends and family that I use. They get the points (which I don’t care about), I mess up the company’s data by adding bullshit from a place 1000+ miles away, and I don’t have to give them my PII.

I can’t say what harms/risks they put on consumers, but I simply don’t like being tracked. It matters to me personally to live in a manner consistent with my values and I enjoy making things harder, even if nobody would ever know, for people/companies whose interests run counter my own.

If this is the only privacy-preserving thing a person does, it probably doesn’t have the impact they hope it does. If they are engaging in privacy-preserving practices, it is one of the easier and low consequence ones they can consistently do.

I personally patronize a regional grocer that doesn’t have a loyalty program. Their shelf prices are the checkout prices everyone pays. I appreciate that and it helps them retain my business.

In the example, “why do I care if Tesco knows I drink Heineken” I usually respond, if it would be creepy for the neighborhood weirdo to track, why is it not creepy for a multinational corporation which can do things he’d never dream of being capable of on a mass scale.

"Personally, yes, I use loyalty cards, credit cards, reward programs, and whatever else to save me some money or get me a perk.  Why?  Because I like the little bit of money and perks I get from them.  I mean, right now I am booking a 3 night stay in Midtown Manhattan using the points I earned on a credit card I use.  This is something I wouldn't do otherwise.  Ultimately, I live a pretty mundane life and I don't really care if various companies know what brand of toilet paper I buy, and I am not concerned about the government coming after me.

Are you paranoid?  Maybe. If you live a pretty much an average life that stays inside the lines of societal norms, then you probably don't have much to worry about.  Companies are not plotting some nefarious conspiracy against you beyond selling you crap you don't need, and the government isn't coming after you.  So if you think those are likely possibilities, then you are paranoid.  If you just don't like the idea of people knowing your business, no matter innocuous it is, then I wouldn't say you are paranoid just a private person (although it does beg the question of why, but ultimately that is your business too).

"From [here](https://about.att.com/story/2024/addressing-illegal-download.html)

Date: July 12, 2024

In April, AT&T learned that customer data was illegally downloaded from our workspace on a third-party cloud platform. We launched an investigation and engaged leading cybersecurity experts to understand the nature and scope of the criminal activity. We have taken steps to close off the illegal access point. We are working with law enforcement in its efforts to arrest those involved in the incident. We understand that at least one person has been apprehended.

Based on our investigation, the compromised data includes files containing AT&T records of calls and texts of nearly all of AT&T’s cellular customers, customers of mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) using AT&T’s wireless network, as well as AT&T’s landline customers who interacted with those cellular numbers between May 1, 2022 - October 31, 2022. The compromised data also includes records from January 2, 2023, for a very small number of customers. The records identify the telephone numbers an AT&T or MVNO cellular number interacted with during these periods. For a subset of records, one or more cell site identification number(s) associated with the interactions are also included.

The data does not contain the content of calls or texts, personal information such as Social Security numbers, dates of birth, or other personally identifiable information. It also does not include some typical information you see in your usage details, such as the time stamp of calls or texts. While the data does not include customer names, there are often ways, using publicly available online tools, to find the name associated with a specific telephone number.

At this time, we do not believe that the data is publicly available.

Our top priority, as always, is our customers. We will provide notice to current and former customers whose information was involved along with resources to help protect their information. We sincerely regret this incident occurred and remain committed to protecting the information in our care. Customers can visit att.com/DataIncident for more information.",r/privacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnUTVyWG5ieTVkSmxIX3NfZ0tsZ0ZBWWgwSlNwU25OY3ZkbWZjSEE5T1Q0OUZIQVMxcnNRc0FHRl9LTVByS0p6aG1zTk9nUEtoSE9jOXpHYnJYd3NnY3dwcU1XZXpiWTFlcG10d1FxTFR5QmM9

"I believe it's a browser native functionality. Even when [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) has restrictions for JS functions that might be think they might still find a way around using some browser specific JS trick. 

I'm not sure how private tabs work too deep. However, I think they are just normal tabs that don't get recorded on your browser history.

With a VPN, you can only hide your ip address from all the websites you enter. But these sites can still see your cookies and use your browser capabilities.

Web APIs can give you access to certain browser capabilities, including searching through your history and switching tabs. Most of these functions have access restrictions, but sometimes trick do the trick. 

What you google can see from the router, to your father's router, to the ips to everyone in the middle. When you search, Google use a GET request, which makes your search appear in the browser bar like ""https://www.google.com/search?q=how%20to%20make%20orange%20juice&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b-1-m""

"Hardened Firefox. brave is not a browser you should trust, since they have done alot of questionable and scummy things in the past. i suggest you dont support them and dont even reccomend them and teach others about the dangers of Brave.

Librewolf is hardened firefox, but easier. i personally prefer normal Hardened firefox since it gets the updates for Firefox faster, wich in turn makes it more secure.

i use firefox with the Arkenfox user.js and they have an excelent guide on how everything works.

"**Nobody figured this out, so I did some digging:**

It seems that some Android apps can access your phone number in a couple of ways. One method involves checking the phone's status, but this isn't very reliable. It might not always work and could even return incorrect information about your number.

**Here's how to see if this applies to your device:**

Go to your phone's Settings app, then tap ""About"" or ""About Phone."" If you see your correct phone number listed there, then an app could potentially see it too.

**Another way apps might get your number:**

There's also an Android permission called ""Read Phone Accounts"" that doesn't require your approval. This could allow apps to access your phone number from your linked WhatsApp account, which appears under User Accounts in Android settings. According to a Stack Overflow article, this vulnerability was supposedly fixed. However, it highlights how your information can still be leaked through other means.

"I find it interesting especially for this sub, that many of the people actually seem to be in favor of the loyalty cards or using them. It seems that in some countries you're able to get a card without providing PII, but in many countries that's not an option, and on some they even have the loyalty card linked on your credit/debit card.

There might not be that big risks at the moment but I just find it uncomfortable to have all my purchases out there for anyone to analyze.

"Keep in mind this is automated for profit. No one is going to bother looking at your data manually. They likely don't handle outliers like people who give fake data, but instead sell/handle everything off in bulk. The buyer/they won't care about the handful of people with fake data. They will simply associate all the data they bought with the data they already have by linking email + birth date + names + address etc, and that's good enough.

Deleting a handful of outlier rows from their databases when trivial algorithms can detect them is much cheaper than investigating each one.
