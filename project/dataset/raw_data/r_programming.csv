"Yeah, beyond the ""[what every programmer should know about Unicode](https://tonsky.me/blog/unicode/)"" posts lurk the actual languages that are expressed in these strings.

To give an additional example, Norwegian and Danish share the æøå letters, but we sort them differently. You should also sort the  expansions as if there were the letter, so in Norwegian words starting with ""aa"" would be at the end of the list, but preferably only in the cases where it's actually a replacement for å. So if the foreign word ""aardvark""  (jordsvin, earth swine) has entered the list somehow, it shouldn't be treated as a variant spelling of  the fictitious word ""årdvark"", but Aas absolutely should be treated as a variant of Ås.

People are accustomed to some incorrect sorting these days though, and, thankfully, usually have access to some search rather than having to manually scan a list.

"Thanks. I’m going to ignore all the bits about how popular React is since that’s not in question; when I talk to clients about frameworks, one of the first things I say is that it’s easiest to find developers and resources for React, which is an important consideration for the longevity of any project, so the advantages of alternative frameworks have to be strong enough to outweigh that.

> There's a lot of talk about React ""not being optimized"" and ""having performance problems"" but mostly this just boils down to inexperience with and misuse of the framework. 

This is simply not true. React is slow because it bypasses the web. The rationale for doing so was comprehensible once upon a time, but this became unnecessary a while ago.

> It's capable of both simple and complex client-side applications (SPAs) and you can get started extremely quickly with tools like Vite.

I’m not sure what about React specifically makes you feel this way apart from your familiarity with it.

> However, isomorphic apps are not foolproof and have an enormous set of footguns. SvelteKit in particular has an enormous amount of issues. I've evaluated it for several startups that and every time there are problems with its tooling or with the framework itself.

While nothing is perfect and I’ve had my struggles with SvelteKit in the past (two-way binding is still a major issue that can’t be ignored), I don’t really know what to tell you except that I have used it and continue to use it today for many kinds of projects worked on by many kinds of developers. With a couple of exceptions, the problems I’ve encountered have been limited and fairly quick to deal with. In contrast, React’s limitations are by design.

> Additionally, it doesn't help that the Svelte community is as defensive as the Rust community. Sometimes pointing out Svelte's failings on GitHub ends up with ""well achkually"" moments, which just turns people off.

I haven’t seen this, but then I also rarely argue with people online about whose is bigger, so I’ll defer to your experience in that department.

> In re: to Lit, the web components ship has sailed. Web components are mostly a failed experiment and while there is somewhat good native browser support for them, they have their own problems.

Alright, I’ll take a moment to address popularity here since that seems to be a recurring theme. Just as React is being used every day by multi-billion dollar companies, so are Web Components. I don’t know why you consider them a ‘failed experiment’ when they’re a perfectly functional, widely-supported, and widely-implemented means of encapsulating behaviour (even with their shortcomings) that’s trivial to use in a much wider variety of scenarios than React is *and* can fit right in alongside any number of alternative approaches. It seems like they’re a victim of their own success.

> The reactivity and data binding model for web components is not straightforward, and CSS can be a massive pain that requires its own tooling. Ultimately, most teams end up removing the CSS boundary and opt to use tools like Tailwind with a singular stylesheet to compensate. As a result the learning curve is super high with Lit and web components.

It’s odd that you say the learning curve is high for Lit and Web Components in the context of React. I need to point out that if you think React is easy to learn and understand, that’s both because you’re already familiar with it and because a lot of people have put a lot of effort into explaining it (which I can’t say for SvelteKit or Lit). There’s nothing inherently easy or straightforward about it, in contrast to something like Web Components, which build on HTML, CSS, and JS—technologies which are still easier to learn even taken together, let alone individually, and have much wider applications than just one framework… *and* are ultimately unavoidable even with React. It always puzzles me to see developers run to Tailwind to avoid all the supposed complexity of CSS while gleefully embracing the likes of React.

The bottom line is that, without intending to attack you personally (given that you’re hardly alone), this sort of contempt for the fundamentals of the web and love for reinvent-the-wheel frameworks like React are a big part of why the online experience is mostly bad today: brittle, slow, unreliable, inaccessible, and hostile to the user. I prefer the approaches of SvelteKit and Lit, but I’m not suggesting they’re the ultimate solution; just the best we’ve got right now.",r/programming,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYbGszVWJ1VXEwRUY1OTgyZjJ6ZHpVTWJWRUxxREdoejhlY3lXZE9FQy1pdHM1S3YwUmFvaWE2Z3RXRUNoLUl1YkdyTGFSS2FDczgxT3NZcEc1VTE2TUE9PQ==

"The blog presents a highly brittle attempt at beating the microarchitecture by turning a data speculation into a control speculation. In the advantageous case computation would proceed with the value that would've been loaded from ""node->next"" in any case, but some 2 clock cycles earlier (i.e. L1 cache latency minus two for +1 and fused cmp-jcc). In current pipelines this means that where previously 16 instructions would've fit under list-walk L1 latency, with this tune-up increased latency will be observed starting at half as many.

The downside is that it does the opposite of branch-free programming by disrupting correctly speculated program flow. This has the effect of reducing instruction window fill and instruction-level parallel execution in loops where the amount of computation per node exceeds 16 instructions, i.e. most application code that isn't a sum of native-length integers.

"- [Espruino](https://www.espruino.com/) is JavaScript for microcontrollers. Runs on a variety of Nordic, ST, and Espressif hardware, and maybe others.
- [eLua](https://eluaproject.net/) is (an) embedded Lua project (there are others, such as [NodeMcu](https://www.nodemcu.com/)). It runs on several platforms, including hardware from ST, TI, NXP, and Atmel.
- C# comes in (to my knowledge) two flavors; the older [.NET Micro Framework](https://netmf.github.io/netmf-interpreter/) that runs on ARM and Blackfin hardware, and the newer [.NET NanoFramework](https://www.nanoframework.net/) that runs on hardware from ST, SiLabs, Espressif, TI, and NXP.
- [DeviceScript](https://microsoft.github.io/devicescript/) is TypeScript for ESP32 and RP2040 boards. It's a little newer, and from my bit of time playing with it, a little rougher around the edges, and at the same time, somewhat ""higher level"" than some of the other projects here, in that you're really supposed to be playing with ""drivers"" that are already built, and not bit-twiddling  output ports.
- [BASIC Stamp 2](https://www.parallax.com/product/basic-stamp-2-microcontroller-module/) is a PIC running a version of BASIC. It's expensive, it's slow, it's very limited, I wouldn't recommend it.
- Java seems a little neglected lately. [MicroEJ](https://developer.microej.com/partner-renesas-mcus-mpus) for Renesas hardware (and others such as ESP32), [pico-java](https://github.com/minirop/pico-java) for RP2040, Parallax's Javelin Stamp.

Of these, my experience is deepest in .NET Micro Framework, and specifically, with devices from GHI Electronics, who used to be (at least) one of the commercial partners. They had/have real clients using NETMF for real commercial products, to the extent that for us, as hobbyists, it was a bit frustrating that they wouldn't move faster and take advantage of more capable hardware, because they had to keep things stable for their large customers.

It's worth pointing out that if you want to try this stuff out, you can get (from the usual suspects) *very* inexpensive ESP32 boards (I recommend ESP32-C3 if you want to use DeviceScript or Micro Framework) that'll do the trick. Cheap, like $2-$3 per board.

"Not at all! But I'd recommend going through the napkin math resource I link at the end. You can get basically all of the questions right by linking what's in the source code to the right 'latency number' in the napkin math repo. 

For example, with the first Python question, you can break it down like this:

* This is the simplest `for` loop possible. In Assembly code this loop would be only a few instructions.
* A modern CPU can execute around 3 billion instructions per second. (Actually more because of instruction pipelining, but we don't need that detail here)
    * This is the 'napkin math number' you need
* Python is an interpreted language so the actual assembly for this Python `for` loop would be _a lot_ more than a few instructions.
* Let's say that Python is at least 10x slower than a compiled language because of the interpreter VM overhead. (The overhead will be a lot higher actually in cases where the code is not as simple as this)
* So that means 300 million loops per second not 3 billion.
* The answer is 113 million, so we're close enough to get the question correct :D",r/programming,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZTXczak1ySWR5X19mckRXbnhGUXFLZkVDN21OMXRhY3plNHFTWE9BNTVpYllPNGMtUzJrLTM2UGtxR3hvNUpNOWg4OU1WOTctWnIxLTRDanZPV0JVR3c9PQ==

"The overall functionality looks sharp! Well done. I""m not sure you really need to be so aggressive with the font colors in the tables. (see my comments below for the actual color values)

I love the use of SHIFT to recursively expand/contract. Nice to have, but not critical, would be to change the chevron under the mouse cursor to 'bold style' when the shift key is down, to just confirm you're holding the right key down. 

It would also be nice to drag the divider between the views so I could see more of one pane (vs the other) 

What's the purpose of the ""tree view"" in the right pane? It appears exactly the same as formatted view with the addition of copy icons. Could you just put the copy icons in the format pane on the left and just remove the tree view? I'm sure you have a good reason, Just saying it isn't clear.

In the format/tree view the use of RGB for the font colors feels odd and too much. Something more subtle like having the labels be dark gray and the values be something else, say dark red (e.g. #AA0000) would be a bit calmer. It's not clear to me you need to show INT/Numbers in a different color, but if you do, a more subtle #008800 would look better as well.",r/programming,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZWktCYXk3S011dDE0OWhuUThFZE1KR1pZLWV3M3FWbEtDallHN2p4LTBUT0RnUjN0M243Wl9Rd0VBWEppZVozNVhkemtNNHVMaWdMaUI4TU9FNU1OY3c9PQ==

Edit: Now, was it smart? You could definitely argue against it. But lots of people who are moving to graphql don't want to keep around a separate rest API as a lot of the goal in moving to graphql is to move faster-- sorta defeats the point if you need to duplicate your backend endpoints.

"Facecrack, Reddit, whatever.

People who complain that they can't see or do this or that on a mobile device so easily forget how novel Internet access was 20 some-odd years ago when Kyocera placed one of the first ""smart phones"" on the market, I know because I still have that device from umteen years ago.

Then there was Palm Pilot that I invested in an flopped. Then Blackbererry.

Now a person can't walk or drive down the street without observing the bulk of humanity glued to some device in their palm, oblivious to the world around them, as if they are consuming some very important content.

And the parents indoctrinate their offspring into that nonsensical behaviour, in part to just keep their kids occupied and not ask them any questions, in part because the parents are doing the same thing, not paying attention to the traffic around them - *even when crossing the street* - and don't want to be hypocrites as they scroll through useless feeds.

And sometimes dutifully obey the garbage in the feeds. 

Shall I mention how people became aware of ""COVID-19""? 

How they wore stupid ass masks for a couple years? And now the same folks who suggested to wear masks to ""save lives"" are supplying weapons to Ukraine and Isreal to destroy lives.

Now if on on one of the very important feeds people are consuming on the mobile device some gov-ment says this or that is a crisis, they just repeat that garbage like little sheep, without vetting anything or caring about formatting.

Religious folks used to be concerned about ""the mark of the beast"" in their palm.

"Rescheduling doesn’t require a trip through the kernel, blocking interactions are verboten or pushed to the very edge of the process where they belong, you can implement exception and resume semantics without `longjmp`y nuttery, etc.

I did up an async coroutine-based runtime for supercomputing a while back, and we were able to beat throughput records with just a TCP networking layer. (Obviously updated to Infiniband, but for a prototype it worked surprisingly well.) Part of the fun is that you could work out on-the-fly where capacities were and how much load any operation would impose, and either push data to wherever the meta-thread is or route the meta-thread to where the data is, just need serdes info to be filled in, and because functions were abstracted around, the runtime could integrate GPUs into it, and flip between CPU and GPU execution as availability dictated. It required conscious management of state, but we were working towards something that could handle hardware threads being knocked out entirely, which most threading runtimes treat as catastrophic.

And of course, async coroutines is how threads actually work under the hood. Somebody has to implement threading runtimes, either in user mode or kernel mode, and until you set a bunch of stuff on top of the basic register-swapping mechanisms used by the kernel you don’t get threading.

So you definitely need a layer on top of coroutines if implemented in C, but beyond that they’re perfectly reasonable.

"Why are you leaving introspection queries open to the public? Its trivial to disable, and only sensible to do so.

And yes, you are back at REST, because you dont need dynamic querying after deployment.

And yes, REST is simpler, technically. But graphql is simpler organizationally.

I very rarely talk with the backend teams. The backend teams only talk with each other when they need a new entity type exposed.

Caching is more complex because its moved to resolver level, but it gives you uniquely identifiable objects in exchange (which is a godsend for keeping client state in sync). 

Are you know what? Sometimes its desirable to have caching at entity-level. Doing it with any REST architecture is challenging, but I digress.

"I’m far from the first to make the observation, but I was saying 20 years ago, if you actually follow “favor composition over inheritance” and “SOLID” to their logical conclusions, you arrive at pure FP.

Conversely, it’s reasonable to ask how you implement “program to the interface” or “data hiding” in the popular OOP sense in a language like Haskell. That leads to posts like [this](https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/posts/existential-haskell.html).

So there’s something to the point that OOP and FP aren’t mutually exclusive. In my case, what I found after a 20+ year OOP career was the reliance on convention, education, and taste to do “good OO design” didn’t scale with the size of a codebase or team. It wasn’t that the principles were bad—it was that the tools weee actively hostile to the principles. Moving to pure FP (first in Scala with Scalaz, then with Cats, then in Haskell) made all the wisdom of “favor composition” and SOLID explicit and first-class, even clarifying some aspects (e.g. the “Liskov substitutability principle” is just contravariance).

Flipping back to the other side of the coin, if you have to work in OOP, you might at least want to take advantage of others’ insights into how to do that effectively, e.g. with [Object Algebras](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~wcook/Drafts/2012/ecoop2012.pdf).

"I wonder why they decided to write everything from scratch in c++ instead of rust. Don’t down vote me, I’m serious!

I’m not trying to be a language snob, but a browser is a tremendous amount of code and you can bet it will be riddled with security issues related to memory safety whether they are senior c++ veterans or not. I’m not even worried about the founders- I’m worried for people that contribute to these code bases who don’t know everything about it. I’m worried for the founders years down the road when they forget about some weird consideration that made sense at the time. Code reviews and unit tests don’t catch as many bugs as people think they do, and this code base is going to be complicated.

IMO using rust for open source projects is awesome because the compiler will almost completely prevent any contributor from creating thread or memory safety issues regardless of their seniority. The mutability/borrowing system keeps code readable from top-to-bottom and prevents people from getting clever with holding onto references to things beyond their intended scope. You can prevent things from being mutated without the infectious consts of C++. The potential for null reference exceptions (ala options) is obvious in code reviews when somebody uses .unwrap(). Error handling with discriminated unions is great compared to exceptions. Refactoring code in rust is such a breeze compared to other languages because of the mutability guarantees. It has seamless interop with C if they still need to dip their toes into unmanaged code. Rust has a good standard library.

Personal preference but I much prefer that Rust has unit tests and documentation built into the language. It has an enforced code style, fewer ways of writing things, and everybody’s code looks the same. It has great iterators for functional programming styles. It has a package manager, and I don’t need somebody versed in the dark mysteries of cmake. I don’t have to periodically re evaluate includes to make sure I am getting the best compile times.

Then someone, usually the asker, answers it, and next time it come up, it's there. We ask things like ""where is the documentation for X"", or ""how do I do X"".

"Aside from some very inefficient assembly scanning and reflection that was happening at startup (which was mostly fixed), the main reason is compute is constrained to what the service needs at steady state under load.

The startup JIT CPU cost is substantially more than what the service needs under load.

"To make sure I understand, you're saying that each ""site"" (by this I assume you mean merchant, not individual merchant store/location), would have its own backend server which includes a datastore?

I'm not sure how a centralized POS backend is ""needless added complexity"" when the solution you're proposing would require literally thousands of servers and databases to manage. And each merchant would require at least 2 servers for redundancy. That sounds like a nightmare to me.

A central platform requires far less resources (and therefore costs less) and is far simpler to maintain.

"""Toit is more platform independent. A lot of the code in this example could be easily developed on a host machine.""

I disagree. For unit testing I have ported the C code running on the microcontroller to my PC. I only had to do two things: A) Create empty functions that used to talk to the hardware. B) remove all the absolute memory locations, so the compiler could just any location in RAM.

Granted, for further testing I had to emulate / fake the hardware functions, but C is very much portable.

If I was tasked to port the C code from one microcontroller to another one, I only had to rewrite the functions that talk to hardware.",r/programming,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZkVIWlVYb2VQUmxnYi1nMzIwZHdpUmZESUo3N29KT3ZxZS1WdEo3cmNlSHZXUFd5OHF2MEJPYU5iTkRMSjllZE9rckNqdjcwOVJnVEFVYkE0UUV4aWc9PQ==

"You're correct about it being a nightmare. 

But most POS systems are built with a backend server that is local to the store, this is necessary because they need to be able to process transactions without internet. Lost revenue just from losing internet access isn't acceptable to most chain merchants.

There is literally just a backend server in the closet. Bigger stores might have redundant servers, most smaller operations like restaurants will run with 1 and pray. They're not big, many restaurants often run them on consumer hardware.

However, ""corporate"" still needs their data, so there is usually some periodic system syncing sales up and new product offerings down.

Even newer ""Cloud POS"" systems often are just bolting a web API and a communication layer on top of that legacy model.

Even ""Cloud first"" systems like Toast still have at least one device functioning as the ""server"" for the site that syncs online orders down and local transactions up.

So yeah, all that added complexity is often there anyway.",r/programming,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaSlphSnl4WlFNdFU0ZTlVOEJuSkpUOW0wSzVDbkpMNUpGQWlZOHB3UFpKZGtQUnI2YjJSa1BsN2xjTEYxc2xzWDdkWVUxZGdiRFFiYUhyVjd1NWMyUlE9PQ==
