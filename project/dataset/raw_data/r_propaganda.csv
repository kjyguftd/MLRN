"More insidiously, Russian influence networks often masquerade as pro-Ukraine or “neutral” usually reposting some 80-90% of second hand material before injecting balance with weaponized propaganda.
Case in point: the story with Ukraine foodstuff import to Poland. There was some enforcement action last week with allegedly tainted food (defrosted ice cream, mislabeled rapeseed and wheat and moldy particles in tomato paste) - Polish regulators fined the importer - either Polish or Ukrainian company. 
Food imports are a sore point because Polish farmers don’t want to compete with foreign, cheaper producers. It’s their basic economic right and we can leave it at that. 
But here we saw a number of “grassroots” account, ostensibly pro-Ukraine, suddenly start pushing a conspiracy theory about West/EU/Ukraine trying to poison Polish population with expired food etc, to destroy farming as an industry and so on.
It would be expected for some marginal figures on the far right and far left to spread something like this. 
But instead In places like Telegram and Quora some of the more visible spaces (like OTAR) and total exposure in tens of millions of views (like Anna Magdalena W[ska] a/k/a Lion in the Jungle) they aggressively push this story, while simultaneously insta-banning and attacking anyone questioning it’s veracity (and frankly sanity).
Once job was done and engagement numbers met the evidence gets deleted and they go back to the usual business of reposting other people’s content, making a few side pennies in process.
The agenda of souring Polish citizenry on Ukraine is high on Kremlins agenda and they are willing to invest time and resources.
It’s not hard to distinguish their influence networks by accepting few principles:
 1. They will tell you what you want to hear most of the times
 2. Absolute lions share of their content will be from other sources, almost never original
 3. Despite loud claims of being open, they don’t tolerate any perceived dissent or questioning. 
 4. The mildest attempt at fact-checking or common sense that doesn’t fit in their 10% agenda will have you removed without warning
 5. They will as a pattern mobilize a small subnetwork of accounts to reinforce whatever needs doing
 6. They will subvert genuine, well meaning users to act in their interests 
 7. Invariably they will accuse whoever they perceive as an enemy of things they themselves are guilty of.

Which is another pattern with Russian subversion: they ALWAYS accuse their victims of their own crimes. This comes from an old Russian adage that the thief screams loudest to “hold the thief”.",r/propaganda,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTMkx5RnFDWTFSRjZfZTBzbDVrbS1acHFvbDRLSlhGOUVLQTEyZFNZd2hmOFU0TnpQS0h4ellXdW1aYi03aDJ6Z21vMWlaYk4xdHhuaE1kNy1tLVh6VHc9PQ==

No, it indicates a wild goose chase. Democrats also hate biological weapons. So, if there were a situation where there was concern that Democrats were uninterested in pursuing the existence of a biological weapon program in Ukraine, the ramifications of a dynamic like that would have significant spillover in militaristic and counterintelligence strategies that would be extremely harmful and reveal significant vulnerabilities.

">Why make it partisan?  

My point exactly. 


>How do you know it's a ""wild goose chase?""  What's that assertion based on?    
  

Because interest in it is partisan where if in fact Ukraine had a biological weapons program *and* Democrats were uninterested, there would be a much bigger problem. Rubio is on the Senate Intel committee and has been for awhile -- he knows better. 

>Nuland admitted and dodged the question to the degree she could under oath,

There's only so much information that could be discussed without revealing classified information or information that she has no idea of because there is no evidence of it that she cannot disclose in Congress. It's often that very dynamic that is used (despite the rules of the game being well known) to portray it as some sort of conspiracy. 

>Truth is, we have no idea, and it's just a matter if you want to believe Ukraine (unwise), Russia (unwise), or US spooks (also unwise). 

While the United States has a track record of lying and misleading the public, *everyone in the world* has a vested interest in knowing if Ukraine has a biological weapons program. The United States has a lot of customers and while the United States has lied to the public, when they lie to other nations, the stakes are often much more significant.

"These arguments are ignorant.

First of all, things like foreign aid and military aid are worth every penny - every time. On top of everything else, it buys you a lot of influence

Secondly, the US isn't giving money to Ukraine. The US government gives money to American weapons manufacturers, so they give Ukraine weapons. It's just corporate welfare. 

Ultimately, what difference does it make to you, if the US spends money to do covert ops in whichever country or uses it for Ukraine?

"> Our economy is teetering on an edge right now, sending billions to other countries seems like a terrible idea.

That is exactly the point. the US isn't sending money to other countries. Passing a Ukraine aid bill doesn't actually give them dollar bills. It's money that the government invests in the American economy. 

We're not giving them a check and telling them ""to buy whatever you want"". We're forcing them to buy OUR stuff.

Of course, you could say ""We shouldn't invest so much into the military-industrial complex! We need to invest more in education, healthcare services, or other sectors that benefit the average Joe"". And that's a totally valid point. But it's not an economical argument.

> it's adding billions to our national debt

So what? Debt doesn't mean anything if the economy is growing at the same rate. But on top of that, the word debt doesn't mean anything to the US because the Dollar is the global reserve currency. If the US runs out of money, they can just print more (like they've done many times already)

It's also important to note that the biggest creditors of the US debt are domestic investors - not foreign countries. One sector's spending is another sector's income. So if the US government doesn't take debt, that means that the private sector is taking debt (because it must all zero out)

If the government reduces their debt, it means that the private sector has accumulated more debt in return",r/propaganda,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTRFJIZ253azBIdnc2UnBjR1owTEhlLXlkY1VJNk9fSm04TzRDeUVWcHpTaXBlOHNnaWVtVEdtSnJBTERzb2JBeDVtV3NCV2pZdVhzMHc3WjBaX1UyMkE9PQ==
"that's pretty much all it does, by way of the military industrial complex. I do not see how in any way it benefits Ukrainians at large.

Ukraine has now placed the private firm Blackrock in charge of its recovery fund, meaning any monetary aid sent to Ukraine is going straight to blackrock, a US private firm. 

Unless the US becomes a wartime economy, it cannot even come close to russin shell production, and this war is being won with artillery. So even if the aid is being recieved in a way that can be directly beneficial to the war effort, which is already a big if, then there's no way it could allow them to win anyway.

Ukraine's average age has risen massively, its youth wiped our or left. It is engaging in conscripting people by kidnapping them off the street, and blocking the accounts of those who have left.

There is no way I can see how this money benefits Ukraine (unless you mean ukrainian elites), it's only really beneficial the US MIC, which is a big reason the US is doing it.

If you'd asked me a few months ago if we should be sending military aid, and if it was doing good, I would have said yes, probably.

"> We're not giving them a check and telling them ""to buy whatever you want"". We're forcing them to buy OUR stuff.

However, the exact same aid bill includes billions for Israel. And, with Israel we have a special deal where a percentage of the aid we send them is basically just a paycheck that they're allowed to use to support their own military industry instead of our own.

Yes, unfortunately, that's a problem. Israel policy doesn't necessarily follow logic and reasoning. Mostly due to religious reasons.

Your interpretation of the economy is called ""Austrian economics"". This ideology believes that the economy is like a household budget. You have money inflow and money outflow and you need to make more money than you spend - otherwise, you'll get into a debt spiral.

But most of today's economists don't believe this anymore. According to them, the entire economy is just ""made up"". Everybody makes up money to represent the value of their country. So it's not like a household budget. You don't need to earn more than you spend, because (except for money that flows outside of the country) everything remains part of the system. 

It's a circular flow: People provide labor to earn money, they spend money to buy things from companies, companies pay taxes, and the government uses those taxes for things that the economy cannot create by itself, like schools, police, military, health care... Generally, things that don't make (or shouldn't make) a profit.

(at least in theory)

So, the US dollar has value because it represents the United States. People believe that the US economy will continue to grow and that their military will protect them from unforeseen events like wars.

Creditors believe that the US will definitely pay back their debts to them in the future, and that's why they lend them money. And there is no reason to believe that this will change in the future. Of course, they might be unforeseen events, but you can't plan for those anyway.

Obviously, that's what all the politicians already know. Even the ones who constantly fear-monger about debt. But they're disingenuous. If they were sincere, they wouldn't hold any stakes in the US economy - but all of them hold stocks and bonds. Generally, it's an argument that is always used to explain why it's a bad thing to use government money to help the people.",r/propaganda,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTdHpZaHZYRTFDQkpHX2psUmRMbWpaaVFRcUZydWZoTDM1RXI0dlpxVWRWUjVMWjJ4SFFkbWVBbGFBend4aWQxRHR1bDd2RExkTFJKYURlQlFPaW5OSmc9PQ==
