"To get a good study in this, you would probably need either a massively multiplex PCR or NGS set up and a lot of people willing to be nasal swabbed every time they have symptoms. If you got enough people to tell you their exact symptoms, exact start of the symptoms, known exposures, you could probably slowly delineate a little better. However, I also hypothesize you would have a lot of viruses detected during allergies that we don't think have effects, convoluting the results.

For context, I have had moderate allergies since about middle school, yet despite knowing myself fairly well, I still miss the early symptoms of colds far more than I care to admit, only realizing it's a cold 2 or 3 days in and I get the thick phlegm starting or deeper chest symptoms. Conversely, as a provider I used to see young military members who move to a new area and are convinced they are sick with something terrible because they have had a ""cold"" for 3 weeks, but you put them on allergy meds and they are magically healed, because they really had an allergy trigger or new allergy they didn't know about.

"Glad it helped! I can't take total credit as I'm sure I picked it up from someone else along the way.   
There are many different formats for resumes & as you get more work experience your education becomes less important than your experience, so it makes sense to lead with the most relevant info first. Remember you want to stand out (in a positive way) & make it easy for the hiring manager to pick you.  
  
Personally I have never been told that this format is not professional. I've had multiple colleagues adjust their format in line with mine & while I haven't gotten every job that I've applied to with it, I've had a pretty good hit rate.

"I have degrees in public health and environmental health. I love PH but honestly, job pickings are slim indeed. It's a grind and often involves longish stints with low pay in the NGO world.

On the other hand, both EH and H&S have plenty of job opportunities and defined career paths. As you said REHS or ASP. The cool thing is, every area needs EH inspectors and H&S professionals, so you're not locked in specific regions.

"Thanks for the kind words.   
Sure, WES is a service that assesses your international academic qualifications/transcripts & essentially adjusts your GPA to make sure it aligns with the country you are applying to (e.g. Canada/US) for better or worse. A bit of a quality check & adjustments of your GPA to make sure that. you are on a level playing field with local applicants. So unless you have any international education you won't need it.  
  
For example, in the UK at my school it was incredibly rare to receive a grade >75%, in fact a distinction was awarded with an average of 70% & it was not uncommon for most of the class to have grades in the 50's & 60's. WES then evaluated my transcript & assigned what those grades would have been in the US/Canada on a GPA scale which were much higher #'s on paper than if I just converted a 65% to a GPA.   
Hope that helps!",r/publichealth,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRkllNUZFOEdHWDR4SGUyRXZvbEJfXzkwb1BId0pXU2U2OXJrTi1BSFZEeExHTnc3VG44YnVJbDhsM2h1aVJJSG1SYzBGQUh5SzVoV3RHWklEQk1fU2c9PQ==
"Yes, 100% this. I have a background in patient care & would argue that it is incredibly valuable as a PH person to understand the frontline context & day-to-day challenges of frontline workers to then develop tailored solutions to those issues (e.g. related to infection control, data quality, quality of care, etc.). In my experience, some in PH like to analyze clinical data, report on it, & criticize clinicians for issues without understanding and trying to address other root causes of those problems. I'm not saying clinicians aren't part of the problem but it is often much more complex than just 'person A did/did not do X'.   
  
Working in admin you will likely identify data quality issues (clinicians generally receive training on their charting from a legal standpoint not from a 'how this could be used for population health' & why free-texting every cell in a chart is problematic for data analysis, etc.). If you're engaged & intellectually curious I am sure you will identify gaps that you could propose addressing, and just by working in the healthcare space there will be more opportunities to network that might lead to something down the line.  If research is of interest suggest co-applying for grants with the surgeons to address some of the identified gaps.

"So I am in the consultant world working for state programs/clients and not many public sector employees can keep up skills or pace wise for private sector. That's not to say there aren't any, but in my experience (multiple states now), those usually already had an analyst background from somewhere else besides public health. The data science folks at these locations usually don't understand the need for flexible analysis data sets and/or don't understand the database or data sources themselves.


For example, I have worked on projects that shouldn't take more than a week to get a minimal mockup using actual data for review or feedback, I was given months. So imagine the contrast between their in house teams and my work at our early project meetings as someone who gets dropped into environments and have to pick up data nuances and legacy processes quickly.


So when people in public sector say X amount of time of experience, it really doesn't mean much unless you have products/end points to demonstrate your capabilities.¬†


I will say that you should be more self motivated in learning new things or more specifically different ways to do things. Most health departments I have found need a lot of hand holding just to articulate what analytics product(s) they actually want. So your technical ability is nice, but when someone says I want to know about this or understand that, you should have or be working on a framework in your head that's at or near your capabilities and suitable for the given project.¬†",r/publichealth,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZN0hubnA0TWh5WkxZMXU1aFhEVkcwdThOSzJGaWxJWkNLbFRPekFDMk5SRWV1eEZRTDZuUkNLR0JjdFNJYzRQZXJ5eUdwejQ3VG5FWmpxdVhaSi01eGc9PQ==

"As it happens, I work in the medical laboratory field. I've worked as a phlebotomist, lab assistant, and as a tech for 10 years. I just finished up my BSPH a few years ago and am trying to figure out what I'm gonna be when I grow up l.

You could potentially try and get on with a state lab with just the micro degree, but more often than not most labs want the Medical Lab science degree/certification. Someone else had suggested getting on as a lab assistant and seeing if you could get trained up. Depending on the area you live in, this could be a good option, but you won't make very good money to start (just to be brutally honest) and depending on where you live you might be required to get additional training or certification (I.e. California, New York, and I think Florida have certification requirements for phlebotomists/lab assistants). However, the laboratory field is an older field, there are a lot of techs that are reaching retirement age so there are a lot of facilities that are willing to train on the job or pay for tuition to get the degree/certification. Since you already have a bachelor's in a science field, you could probably do the MLT/MLS cert program in a year and take the exam. I know there are online programs like UCinn, Weber State, and UND that could be options as well if you can get a job at a local lab. 

I recommend you look at the following websites to learn about MLT/MLS certifications and trainings. The ASCP is the gold standard for certification, but I have yet to work at a lab that didn't also accept the AMT certification as well.

"imo a health comms specialist should be pretty well versed in theoretical models about health comms and behavior change; be an excellent plain language writer and a decent information designer; have a strong command of the CDC Clear Communications Index and be able to use it to score existing material, and effectively create new material that scores very highly on the CDC CCI. Bonus points if the HCS is able to do pretty good user research / audience research, and has a pretty good grasp of communications strategies in a specific topic area, and has a good grasp on how to evaluate (even roughly) the effectiveness of health communications work.",r/publichealth,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhX0YzZ1hGSVY1WDZrcXE4ZUpmOG5MZE4tNlpWYncyUUtEbmMxVVdUemZqZks2WmFzUGg1MkN6LUtEazRBY256M3hmWU5WdnpBRm5aeElibGlEUnRMZlE9PQ==
"I'm a health comms specialist. 

I help develop press kits for medical journal articles, new federal policy, and social media roll-outs for disease or treatment updates. At this level, it really helps to have an MPH to comprehend the data and research that we communicate. Though, as a research coordinator, you seem to have this covered.

At my old job at another organization, I had the exact same title, but used almost no public health expertise. I did some demography and GIS research on vaccine uptake, but it was mostly developing social media, print, or video projects, much like any other marketing jobs.

Both of these jobs are in government. Most health comms jobs will be in healthcare or pharma marketing, which are more traditional comms jobs.",r/publichealth,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhWkxETGpaRzd4aExWVnBTanZyVlZmNDVpeHVoTnNOeHBPMnBqamhxV1kwQXpENWk5WWpVS0ZvVWhYeUpMOVFrNXhESzd5aGtkcVUzMXJXLVFlaUpMUnc9PQ==
"Commenting to offer a different perspective, and some productive suggestions. I'm in a similar position, except I have about 5 years of PH experience. I cannot stop working to pursue further education, I'm on the fence about taking $60-100k in loans for an MPH, and I also cannot accept an abysmal stipend 1/3 of my salary for 5+ years for a PhD. So I thought about DrPHs.

Here are some suggestions from well-respected and established institutions, CEPH accredited. I.e, not ""sketchy"".

[Penn State](https://med.psu.edu/drph/apply) requires supplemental courses, or passing a PH knowledge exam to matriculate for a DrPH.

[Tulane](https://sph.tulane.edu/drph) requires a similar supplement as Penn State, offered for ""outstanding candidates"".

[UNC Gillings](https://sph.unc.edu/hpm/hpm-drph/) has a one-course requirement for non Master's applicants, this one is more leadership focused than the other two, which may explain the difference.

So no, it's not a deal breaker, but you will have to show that you can handle the curriculum. One thing I have been doing is independent research, and publishing in highly-regarded peer journals. If you have colleagues or mentors who can give you a side project for this, this can bolster your application. You might consider taking additional certifications or courses in statistical languages or analysis to show your commitment.

Hope this helps!

*Soapbox moment*: we are in the field of public health, which arguably would make people aware of inequities and disparities at large. There are very talented, smart, and capable candidates who simply did not have the fortune of financial or domestic support to aid their path to higher education, and who currently, may not be able to do that now they're in a well-paying role. 

Many years ago, MPHs were designed for PH professionals who have **worked** before pursuing higher ed, now they're just money-makers which has led to this oversaturation in the market of people who haven't worked a real PH job, while folks who have dedicated their careers to this profession are passed up because they don't have a piece of paper. 

Don't let what other people who haven't walked a mile in your shoes tell you what is and isn't possible. They say it isn't possible because it hasn't been done. You *can* do it, you may just have to bolster your application to do so. Good luck!",r/publichealth,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhcnp1ZUlEdEhIcnpOX0JSYU4xRFFOYlg5czkwOVZyUTFMT0lLT3hCZXJtNWhUdm55YUpsNWN0VWpid0dvUWFqck5uRzEwUWVNV0ZQQWdCM3ZGeE5nNmc9PQ==
THIS! I 100% agree. I‚Äôm not able to afford an MPH and have tried to avoid it because of that (and still paying undergrad loans). I truly just want to learn. I wish it wasn‚Äôt so incredibly difficult. Thank you for this inspiring message. Good luck to you as well.,r/publichealth,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhTEUzNnRpWnlRTXRPRXpWdk9rX0JlSGQ1TURLdVJkMUFwVlI0c0RRVmpxSG5ZaUtNXzY5WHFUUFc3ekxpcWpJZkN5V2Q2ZEJnLS1QUmFjSVBjU3JpdVE9PQ==
"The project I‚Äôm working on is across several states (I don‚Äôt manage it, but I get to see some of how they filter the bots).

Our survey is in increments, so it‚Äôs a screener, then the actual survey. If names, emails, and other personal information doesn‚Äôt match up between surveys, the participant is kicked. IP addresses are also looked at - if they‚Äôre in a really weird location based on our target population (like we‚Äôre looking for Arkansas, but someone pinged in France), they‚Äôre out.

If they can‚Äôt actually tell, then they reach out to the participant.

They have some other ways to weed out folk, but I‚Äôm not entirely sure what those methods are.",r/publichealth,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhdlMtYTJ2QnJwSGp2MnpFV2UxbEpjdVZlYWhqNU5LLV9aU0ZsM1JGVGducnFEbnd1c2d4UFpCX2dDOFB4bFBfY3dQZzlORUNjRlRjVndaMWwzcDdqbUE9PQ==
