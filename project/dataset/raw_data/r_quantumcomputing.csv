"> I am in my late 20s doing PhD research at a prestigious lab running superconducting quantum processors, and in my view I will be very lucky if I get to see an actual fault-tolerant quantum computer of millions of qubits during my lifetime.

Where would you say QC in 2024 is equivalent to in time to where classical computing was?

I would say we're not even yet at the late 1930's level of computing yet. As in 1940 is when the first British Bombe was installed, that was an electro-mechanical computer designed to crack the German codes. I think it's obvious to even casual observers of Quantum Computing, we're not yet at the 2024 equivalent of that for QC.

So is the current state of Quantum Computing at the level of the early 1930's? Or 1920's? Or not even that? Maybe QC is only at the level of [Babbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage)'s [Difference Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_Engine)? If so we have the equivalent of another century of development before we can create the modern day equivalent of whatever an early 1940's [Bombe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombe) would be like.",r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTM21JOVR2OWI0dEYzMmIxeEc0RVRQUzlfRWpFVExKdmJ6MHhvTnVIUDhCb2t5M2RwcGNSNlUtQUVfeTZBWDZuX2MzVWlDOW8ySU52SWJXdWhxSmFqd2c9PQ==

"Most of the examples of a quantum advantage are purely theoretical. For example, some prominent examples of quantum advantage include Grover's algorithm, Shor's algorithm, Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, and more. These algorithms have been proposed mathematically but practically building a quantum computer to implement one of them is difficult.

There are some experimental examples that have claimed quantum advantage as well, though much of this work is still controversial. For instance, [IBM claims to have demonstrated quantum advantage](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06096-3) in their noisy quantum computers compared to a classical algorithm. Others have disputed this, arguing that there might exist classical algorithms that can do this problem more effectively.

In addition, there have been experimental examples of quantum advantage for solving problems that don't really matter in any practical sense. Researchers will concoct a problem for the purpose of demonstrating quantum advantage and then implement it on a quantum computer. One of the first examples of this is work done by google demonstrating a quantum advantage using superconducting qubits.

"A good drinking game for anyone interested is to look up the latest articles on quantum “breakthroughs” and see how many use the phrase “highly scalable”.

In every situation I’ve seen this used, including in this article, it has barely been demonstrated in a tiny-scale form and there is no evidence on how they would scale. This is significant because there is no way that quantum computers could be usable if these schemes can’t be scaled.

This study in this article demonstrated a process with a one-qubit system and concluded that it could be scaled arbitrarily - I don’t think we need to dig back into our physics textbooks to say that whilst that is great marketing, it’s terrible science.

The article makes this point for me - they say that approaches researchers currently use to connect to quantum computers (for example IBM and Amazon Web Services (AWS)) are not scalable - however, they would also have us believe that the unproven system that the scientists are proposing, would be scalable.

The usefulness of the proposal hinges on the idea that it is not acceptable for the company hosting the quantum computer – e.g. IBM or AWS – to be able to snoop on the quantum algorithms being run.

However, people accept this with cloud computing (and remote access to supercomputers) which are used widely in almost every industry to store proprietary information and this is not viewed as a problem there.

To round it off in classic fashion the article states ""Quantum computers are poised to outperform the world's most Powerful supercomputers"". This unproven statement might be a good one to add to your 2024 quantum computing bullshit bingo card.

"Hi all,

I am a mathematics graduate at bachelors level due to commence my masters in computer science later this year. The university I will be attending have a vast research group in Quantum Computing and offer a masters level course in this field which I will be looking to take. Given how quantum computing is emerging as an exciting field in the past years and gaining more and more multidisciplinary attention, I am starting to looking into it, gain some knowledge and possibly consider writing my master thesis on some QC related topic (too early to say as I am just starting to delve into it). The reason I am writing this post is to get some of your insights into what concepts / themes of QC I could possibly narrow my interests considering my background in pure mathematics. Throughout my undergraduate, I enjoyed studying optimisation, algorithms and linear algebra. Additionally, I have also took courses on machine learning and artificial intelligence in my last year (Which I believe could somehow be combined to QC but I am not sure how relevant this is and how much I could expand on this).

"What problem are you actually trying to solve? Your question is confusing. It's like asking for an academic paper comparing the lubrication performance of motor oil versus ice cream. Published research on such a question is going to be scarce because it's not a question that comes up in practical situations.

Current quantum computers are a long way from being able to run even a small support vector machine. Even in a fictional future world where the hardware constraints disappear, it's deeply unclear that SVMs would be a useful quantum algorithm because they're specifically designed to help classical computers deal with classification problems. There's almost certainly a better quantum algorithm (again, assuming away hardware constraints) to solve the same problem set. On current quantum simulators, running non-trivial SVMs would probably take millions of times longer than just running its classical version, because they're doing a bunch of work to take a classical algorithm into quantum land and back again.

Quantum computers aren't magical accelerators to classical workloads. They work very differently. As far as current science tells us, there is no useful comparison between running the same algorithm on both classical and quantum. They require different algorithms.",r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTcFEyMFNGNXlhYjBuQ05kaFJjNzZMY2lzc1JRN0luSVM2TDZPLTAxSnRUemtWZUNLcjdjTkN0V0ZGVjlCNEhCVGNrc0tmUXNDRVo0SEJaYWNnOTF4Mnc9PQ==

"Hello everyone! I’m searching for a project that I can build out in Qiskit this summer to further my understanding of Quantum Computing. I’m an undergrad in CS, and recently took a quantum computing class aimed at computer scientists; it covered the basics of quantum systems as well as a few important algorithms (Deutsch Josza, Grover’s, Shor’s), ending with basic fault tolerance and error correction. The two main projects for the class were a Grover’s Algorithm implementation and a library that performed error correction and fault tolerant gates using the Steane Encoding. I plan to take a further course in error correction, but I haven’t found any good projects in that sector. The ideas don’t need to be strictly error correction though - my current idea is finding the ground state energy of a molecule, and I think working with pulses could also be very interesting, so any help is welcome!

"Hi! I recently completed my high school and was researching about what to pursue in future and I stumbled upon Quantum Computing and found it pretty interesting. I watched some youtube videos where they explained that QC is fairly different from classical computing. Classical computers work on bits (0,1) whereas QC works on a Quantum bit which is like a superposition of 0 and 1.   
I thought to myself that this thing could be revolutionising but for that we need to reach 1M qubits (I don't know what that means tho). It would take around 2-3 decades for QC to replace classical computer.  
This could provide me a work opportunity.  
So I wanna ask that how do I start QC? What are the job aspects? Where do I learn and know about this stuff?  
How will it affect my future?  
I have so many questions regarding this. I would appreciate some answers from you guys.",r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUSlIwOEdyYUVpNnJMeVdMMHBKWTVnUGhCbzd4VmNIcmh2akhGaXdwaEZQUzdFeFRxb3NOQmx1YlhTdTFPSENyZEZERV9weUVUVnhtTkR1ZnV6aDMtTFE9PQ==

University with a degree in physics, electrical engineering, math, or (less advisably) computer science.

If you are looking for a head start, there are lots of suggestions for learning resources available on this sub, but I don’t know how accessible they are for a high schooler.

"I think it’s different. We already can have “high level abstractions” and an actually a lot of QC programming is done in high level languages like python. But to understand what is happening I do think the circuit representation is better: you can have different gates on different qbits and with entanglement it can be a mess to keep in mind what’s going on by just looking at sequential code. And as an added point, the circuit representation is actually hardware agnostic: it does not care if your computer is photon-based or is made of cold-atoms. Every type of QC implements gates differently, and some only approximate quantum universality (the ability to implant any unitary operations)!

I do also think that when QC will be mature, since they are useful for only a handful of problems, we will just refer to what algorithm the computer is running.

I really don't know which to decide, I haven't applied yet. I will be joining in September 2025. But want to create a well structured decision based on a few perspectives.

"**Getting a Hardware/Research Job in Quantum Computing**


I’m currently a postdoc working on experiments in cryogenic temperatures down to mK for light dark matter searches. I also use superconducting qubits as single photon detectors.

I've been leading several projects (leading a small team of several students and Phds), from initial theory ideas through to publication. This includes everything from simulations and development to data collection and analysis. I would consider myself a full stack experimentalist.

"So first, the quantum computing unit of information, called a qubit, is not multiple states existing simultaneously. What is happening is more nuanced than that, but I won't get into it.

Next, the butterfly effect is a different phenomenon more related to chaos theory. That is, if you have a dynamical system, it could be extremely sensitive to initial conditions as well as impossible to numerically predict its future state (these things are related).

Your last question is interesting, though, because an advantage of a quantum machine is that it would be able to naturally simulate a quantum mechanical system.

"Using the roughest estimates possible as a teaching tool:

It is hard to use classical computers to simulate quantum matter because every time you add an electron, proton, photon, etc the amount of memory you need to store all the data doubles. Eg simulating 10 electrons needs about 1024 numbers to be kept in your computer's memory. 

Using a quantum computer, the hardware components are also quantum so it is kind of like the available memory doubles every time you add a qubit to your processor. E.g 10 electrons can be simulated with 10 qubits of memory, which hide the 1024 ""classical computer"" numbers.

"Given your background in CS, one path would be to position yourself on the programming side.

I'd probably recommend this over starting over in physics, as it will be a more more straightforward path for you and there are still plenty of jobs that require that skill set. You could also consider starting with some non academic certifications to get a feel for the field.

Its a bit hard to give advice right now because things are changing quickly. The field is getting more competitive, but also teams are getting bigger and do hire some people without PhD.

"|phi1> is a sum of terms of the form |x> (x) (|0> - |1>) / sqrt(2).

Consider how applying the oracle Uf acts on each of them (remember that Uf flips the ancilia if f(x)=1):

|x> (x) (|f(x) (+) 0> - |f(x) (+) 1>) / sqrt(2)

More explicitly, if f(x) = 0, this is:

|x> (x) (|0> - |1>) / sqrt(2)

if f(x) = 1, this is:

|x> (x) (|1> - |0>) / sqrt(2)

You notice a global sign flip if f(x) = 1 and no sign flip if f(x) = 0, thus you can write:

(-1)\\^f(x) |x> (x) (|1> - |0>) / sqrt(2)

This is known as phase kickback. Applying a unitary on |a> (x) |b> would make you think that |b> will be affected, but in the end only a global phase shift is contributed because your input is an eigenvector of your unitary. Here, any |k> (x) (|0> - |1>) / sqrt(2), with |k> in the computational basis, is an eigenvector of the oracle, and this is precisely why the ancilia has to be prepared in that specific state for the algorithm to work.",r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkamRoMW82bDkyZjZud203SlFEWVMyLWJpTnY1dDRkWTVZbDRiMDJUSkk4R0sycUo3VHE0ajgzcTVBanVVRy1YSy1KcHd5LWszZ25sS3VuWmh6LXZ1VnNLWVFPX0FQekthaWR4dmlTUkF0OWM9

Because, when I think of Uf as not a matrix but a circuit, whose top output should be kept as is:

>The top input, |x⟩, will be the qubit value that one wishes to evaluate and the bottom input, |y⟩, controls the output. The top output **will be the same** as the input qubit |x⟩ and the bottom output will be the qubit |y ⊕ f (x)⟩, where ⊕ is XOR, the exclusive-or operation (binary addition modulo 2.) We are going to write from left to right the top qubit first and then the bottom. So we say that this function takes the state|x,y⟩tothestate|x,y⊕ f(x)⟩

When your inputs are not in superposition states, the oracle behaves like a classical circuit. Otherwise, it's no longer safe to assume that there will be a well-defined notion of what is affecting or controlling what.

For example, a similar phenomenon of phase kickback can cause a control gate (such as a CNOT) to appear flipping the ""control"" bit without changing the ""controlled"" bit.",r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsYWxyQ21LZ2RhakRNMzJRRklSaVNSWTVONUFSbUZmWkxQUVZJQUw1cXJrLTRnb3VfQjZiTFJKTk5XQ0NqRVFrZi1US05aUGJQNTVNdVR0NFdfYjdYX0t6dXU1Y3RoTXE4MDBneFByOEdxQ0E9

"Quantum computing is in the same weird place as AI and other academic fields that suddenly receive a lot of attention and money from industry. There is a lot of very interesting, high-quality science coming out of universities and functioning prototypes that can perform small calculations. However, there are also some top professors getting involved with tech companies who are incentivised to promote QC as the greatest technological revolution of our lifetimes. In short, unless you are a researcher deep in the field it is hard to actually judge the practical, business case for a computer that costs millions of dollars but may be able to run some algorithms faster than a classical computer.

"You are not missing sth: e^{iAt} is one of the caveats of many quantum algorithms that is not emphasized enough. 
You can either use block encoding ``[A .\\\\. .]`` in that case you can directly map matrix elements to quantum gates or you can write matrix as a sum of orthogonal matrices which can be mapped into quantum gates.
Or you can use trotter-suzuki to get exponentiation by using terms in the summation A=\\sum_i Hi. 

For the resulting circuit complexity;
there are many more methods and suggestions but I do not think the overall complexity can go down from Omega(n^2) because if you have matrix with n^2 independent elements, then you have to have n^2 independent gates to represent that matrix.

Not about anything being worked on right now (at least I hope it's not), not even the semantic models. Not even self replicating agents. Not alignment, not interesting new cost functions.

"It's definitely possible to do this type of pivot (I used to study SWE within CS before pivoting to more theoretical CS and then subsequently QC), but it is certainly *a* pivot. Depending on your interests, there's lots of traditional SWE work that is needed to support companies doing quantum research. Take for example qiskit, it's a python library and it's written by a team/community of primarily software engineers. Knowing quantum stuff helps, but ultimately the knowing how to make good software is just as important.

That being said, that type of work isn't really the same as ""quantum algorithms"". Quantum algorithms is a lot more in-depth and you'd likely have to spend a bit more time getting familiar with both theoretical computer science, and quantum computing as a whole. If you haven't studied some of the famous existing quantum algorithms (e.g. Grover's, Shors, any of the early 'supremacy' algos such as Deutsch-Jozsa), I'd start there. It's quite different from how you have to think about classical algorithms, since quantum information brings about a whole new set of restrictions (no cloning, measurement alters state, need to take advantage of interference to see a speedup).",r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuY3Y5dks2SzNqdDJab0FSRGVSdnZvR0xvT3JmZDYtNGxJcWxBQllOSUk4UFg1Q2ZVV0RKZGpzbjdWanl5aThWV185X0xGVnBsVWVxcGplUmNsVlJIRTJBRFZ0Y1BBb21QZ2FIc1g4VEZoTEU9

"Hi there, I’ll be pursuing my Master’s in CS this year. I was wondering what kind of internships are helpful for having a career/job in quantum computing in the near future. 

A little bit about my background, I am a Python Programmer (Intermediate level) as well as a 3D Designer, I have done number of projects in Python and during my bachelors in Computer Engineering. However, I have no prior research experience, Although I do wish to get in an internship next year, and I wanted to start applying from now asap. But I am not sure if I have the threshold requirements for a QC internship. I just have some basic projects on my github in QC like building a random number generator or quantum coin flip. 

Can anyone list down some companies that have started hiring/opened for internships in QC? And also suggest me some ways to build my portfolio in around 15 days of time so that I can start applying directly. (I do not wish to say that I am assuming it’s going to be easy, but I really want some guidance and help here). 

Any certification/courses that I should do to start applying right away? Because I believe that even to get an internship next year, I’ll have to start looking from this moment itself.

"It’s a part of IBM sharing their progress as they go. And as someone who leads a product team at another quantum company I value the preprints that they share, and have been following the journey of Qiskit closely.

The default negativity on this thread is curious, but understandable given this is Reddit, but for those genuinely interested in quantum computing I’d encourage a little more appreciation of the people and work being shared.

LLM utility is both an obviously useful tool for quantum computing SDKs and frameworks, but also something to show sensible caution over. Preprints can help share this balanced take while the industry elsewhere is drowning in hype.

I’m personally interested in the use of LLMs and other forms of AI to explore circuit creation and synthetic data creation, both of which peers are exploring proper, but I’ve got 99% of my day focused on just delivering what we know we need to build.

"Hi everyone,

Im studying eletronic engineering in my first semester, but ive already have experience in a lot of the math and physics in the ""basic course"" because ive done a lot of Olympiads in high school, besides other university i have joined, but left it after some time.

Im saying this only because im really interested in this research area about Quantum Computing, but im not sure where i should start, not even sure if as an eletronic engineer i could work in this area, so im thinking of change my course to computer eng, i already have grades for this, but i need some advices.

So, if you were a student in some university and wanted to explore this area of Quantum Computing, which course would you do and where would you start, knowing the fact that you already know the basics of quantum mechanis ?

Since now, thanks for the answers. :D",r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvX1hNbl9jV0xJWFdRNGhFd3pkQzg4UnMzQ1A5UWZtQWR2eHBiSzVtNVJoa0dQNU9kWno5N0hSMW0tOGRyX3RGMjBzSXI2a3RVX0xZVFYxQjBmSzI1cGc9PQ==
"Admittance of my lack of knowledge is not a suggestion of my dismissal or laziness towards the subject.  I am a physicist as well as an artist, and I understand if you think I'm using ""quantum"" as a pop science term to leverage my art. 

I have worked with quantum computers in terms of hardware and am expanding to more computational aspects of quantum computing. My post itself was made to speak to others who could provide their own genuine passions for the field so that my project can highlight both the human and scientific aspects of being involved in a field where the advantage is yet to be fully realized. 

There's a reason why many collectives are creating artist in residence programs and trying to onboard creatives to work with quantum computing-- it's to reconcile the perceived gap between science and art, and why my project began. 

Perhaps the lack of concrete information due to privacy with my org is what made this suggestion to you, but I hope my message reads as a push for you to be true and honest about how you perceive newcomers to the field regardless of their background or identity.",r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvdDU5RjRnVkc0ZWRmVVZjUmJXejdNZkc2cmJzenFjVk4wWmxNcmNxdTJWQzAyZXVKd2hXWGVjN1oxVHVlY1BJWllwaUpJazFWLXZidGczUjU4UVFtTHc9PQ==

"> Remember, quantum particles can exist in multiple states at once, like a coin spinning in the air before it lands on heads or tails. This ""superposition"" allows quantum computers to explore countless possibilities simultaneously, making them ideal for tackling complex problems that involve a huge number of variables. It's like having a map of the maze and being able to explore all paths at the same time, leading you to the exit much faster.

This is a bad characterization of how quantum computers work and just generally not true. This describes something more akin to a non-deterministic Turing machine which is thought to be much more powerful than a quantum computer (if this were not the case, then QCs would be able to solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time). 

In fact this is [the tagline on Scott Aaronson's blog](https://scottaaronson.blog/)

The rest of this article reads poorly by telling the reader to ""imagine a future where..."" without explaining how these topics relate. Quantum computing may one day somehow help speed up ML processes, but I wouldn't hold my breath. QNNs and QSVMs don't really seem like they're a reasonable replacement for traditional ML techniques (although this is just my opinion). HHL might one day help with speeding up the matrix math used in ML but again I wouldn't hold my breath for this being realized practically any time soon.

"VQE suffers from a huge a number of theoretical issues (see barren plateaux) and there is a growing consensus that it will not be useful as a NISQ application.

Photonic quantum computers are certainly not cheaper by default. It is difficult to get individual photons to interact with each other the level required for information processing. 

Cooling is not necessarily the hard part about building quantum chips, and while may present a challenge long term for scaling up, has mostly been solved in the short term. Photonic chips will still required a great deal of cooling as certain highly precise components require a great deal of cooling. 

I know this doesn’t answer your question, but I hope I’ve provided some perspective.",r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2RnA2SXlMYWx1bGJKN2VLa0djUVBJS1RlV0hOT0lRRkhKNHo3V1ZESXRlMHhNNXFBTFJRdXhaRU1NQ1Q2WDk1N3htTEhEQ1JGZXh0WktlM0thRm1UQVE9PQ==

"Sure. You can operate waveguides, fibers, and beam splitters at room temperature. You can even fabricate on chip gates. Even non-local 2 qubit gates can be done. There’s good recent work out of Prof. Chee Wei Wong’s group, Andrew Wiener’s group, and Maria Spiropulu’s group about some of this stuff done experimentally. There’s also good work from a lot of Chinese groups like Jianwei Pan’s group at USTC. Christine Silberhorn’s group also has a lot of good photonics people. 

But the issue arises when you want to do measurement. You at least need LN2 temperatures for stuff involving APDs (which have way too many dark counts for people to enjoy), and 4K temperatures for most low jitter, low dark counts, high quantum efficiency SNSPDs. 

But then for some nonlinear waveguides like BaTiO3, there are may be some unfun phase changes at lower temperatures. Lithium Niobate is all the rage right now, but it’s not compatible with foundry processes (you have to build a dirty fab, or a fab facility dedicated to doing Lithium+semiconductor processing) as Li is a very very reactive element [Li battery fires used to be a concern]. 

For single photon sources that aren’t stuff like attenuating a laser into PPLN or PPKTP waveguides and the like, they need to be operated at cryo temps, and integrating them onto a photonic chip also has its challenges. For example, lots of quantum dots love to have photonic crystal cavities for Purcell enhancement. Then you would need a photonic crystal waveguide to collect the light somehow, etc. 

Also, what basis? There are a lot of basis you can pick for photonic QC. Each have their own advantages and disadvantages. Also On chip photonics can be hard to adjust the gate/circuit level stuff depending on the basis you pick. Like it’s not really trivial how to spacially shift optical components on a silicon chip. Anyways, this is probably overkill on detail, but everything has its issues right now.

Photonic QCs can get real expensive real fast. Tape outs are expensive (on chip optics aren’t trivial to make), sorption fridges and SNSPDs cost a lot, don’t get me started on the cost of really high quality lasers. Sometimes you want some erbium doped fiber amps, etc.

Compare it to superconducting. Stuff like Dolan Bridge or Manhattan process to make JJ isn’t trivial, but I would say this is easier than the much larger scale integration and careful fabrication needed for some photonics chips.

But, what I will say about photons is that no matter what platform you use for computation, you always will need to rely on the photon for communication.",r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2UHN2MEh1ZmRkMG5ZeVhmTW5uSlRlaXEzRm9wWWFJc21yanNXdXEyekhtZEEwSjJtR3BUQ3hySHhPMjU2ZFo4N1dYR3ViVTRtN1JxeFBXMC1wVHE4WFE9PQ==

I work on a team doing something like this and we were assembled specifically based on our skill sets and prior project exposure.

We’ve got an even mix but various depth of expertise of Physics and Computer Science on one axis, and Research to Commercial on the other. This is increasingly becoming the norm as the “quantum utility” era drives the funding that drives the research intentions that drive the papers published.

Every member of the team is expecting to have a conversational understanding of every other though.

"The idea is that superposition (the ability of a quantum object to be in multiple states at once) allows us to explore multiple different solutions to a problem at once.

Quantum computers have the unique property of exponential state space growth with the addition of more qubits. And when we entangle more than one qubit to another, we can better manipulate that 2^n search space, where n is the number of qubits.

Algorithms like shors algorithm combine a few of these techniques to effectively search for a solution in a wide range of possibilities simultaneously in a way that a classical computer could never do.

If you have time,  you should look up that algorithm and try to understand how it works. Many different possible answers to a sub problem are put into a superposition, and a QFT (quantum Fourier transform) is used to find the most frequent solutions in that search space in parallel.

Classical computers would take millennia to factor the numbers we believe shors algorithm can do.",r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4bDV3M3RJU1d6RE01dDljbXdDcFMzWHRoenJvQ2l5TTV6MHpHZ3dDaFNROGR0REwwNzZ4dGlXcjFkclFLQTRKc1RFYll4RTVtMmp1djQ5SFdFWnUzS3BkZXJhejFXbUxuNE9RZnNBcTNSSDQ9

"The idea of parallelism in quantum computing is generally widely misused and misunderstood, not helped by press releases, pop science, and lots of oversimplification. It is usually well intentioned, but is prolific enough that lots of conversations to people outside of the field start with explaining why quantum computing is not just ‘trying every possible solution at the same time’.

What they often mean is something like: I have a function (a unitary operation) that can operate on quantum states e.g. send |x>|0> to |x> |f(x)>. This also works in superposition e.g. send |x>|0> + |y>|0>  to |x> |f(x)> + |y> |f(y)> with a single application of my function.  Wow my operation is operating in parallel.

These superposition states are easy to build, consider the Hadamard gate can be used as H|0> = (1/sqrt(2) )(|0> + |1>). This creates a uniform superposition over the binary strings of length 1: 0 and 1. 

If I used a Hadamard gate on every single one of my (originally |0>) n states - I can create a uniform superposition over all binary strings of length n. Then just apply my function and I’ve explored every possible value of my function in parallel, wow an incredible speed up - it would have taken me 2^n applications of my function to do this classically.

Except I haven’t really. The crucial concept that’s missed is how I get information out of my quantum state. When I measure my state, I collapse my superposition and project the quantum state accordingly. In the case of the above - I’d get to read out x and f(x) as values, but just for one value of x. As my state was in a uniform superposition, the x I get here is a completely random binary string. 

In fact, it is well known (and proven) that for a single measurement of my quantum state - I can only get at most n bits of information out of my n bit state. The quantum state contains vastly more information than that, but we’re limited by our ability to read it. To get more information out, I need to repeat my entire algorithm again and measure. In the example above, I now have to start hoping I don’t read out things I’ve already measured. The way I’ve set up this problem, it would currently be better to run it on a classical computer.

The difficulty in quantum computing is that we’re working with probabilities, and to get useful information out e.g. which x minimises f(x), you’re going to need to find a way to maximise the probability of reading out that specific x.

Broadly, there are three parts of a quantum algorithm: initial state preparation, state evolution, and measurement. To get theoretical advantage, you need to consider all of these parts, and ensure that none of them are going to cost you the advantage. In the ‘parallel’ explanations, nearly all of them neglect measurement.

There are some problems where we’ve managed to create theoretical advantage (usually by exploiting some kind of structure or pattern in the problem itself) e.g. Shor’s algorithm, HHl, Quantum Amplitude Estimation, Quantum Signal Processing; but these are not without their own problems. HHL for example, solves Ax=b faster than classical - but all advantage is lost in having to measure and readout the solution.

The standard resource to recommend for qc is Nielsen and Chuang’s “Quantum Computation and Quantum Information” which is a fantastic textbook requiring some mathematics background.

"How do I make the most of my time in a M.S. in Mathematics program to prepare for a QC career?

I have a BS in math, I am working fulltime as an actuary and enrolled in a part-time MS in math in January. It should take me a little over 3 years to complete. I have already read several books on quantum computing written at the undergraduate level. I want to eventually work in quantum computing. Probably in algorithms rather than hardware due to my background.

I am taking every course that could be relevant to QC - Number Theory, Abstract Algebra, Graph Theory, etc.

I reached out to the physics department of my university to see if there was any quantum-related research projects a math graduate student could participate in, but no luck so far.

"How to get into masters or phd in quantum computing with a computer science background? (In Canada)

Hi! I’m a software engineer with 10+ industry experience and my background is in computer science, I didn’t have any physics in my studies (bachelor or master). I’m trying to apply to masters or phd in quantum computing and most of the programs are just rejecting me due to lack of theoretical physics (UofT, Waterloo, Quarmen etc). What will be the best option for me to get into study? Get undergrad in physics and then apply? Get some physics courses (which would be the best option for me personally)? 
For some context: I work full time and have 3 kids, so I am very much reluctant to go into undergrad physics first, that’s why it’s hard for me to decide and asking for help from the community. 
And my ultimate goal is to be a quantum algorithms researcher and develop quantum software to run in quantum computers. Want to have some sort of formal education to be able to apply for jobs in the field too (applying now, no luck, getting rejected due to no relevant experience).

"the exciting part of a new computing paradigm is that we don't yet know what it can do. classical computing has been around long enough that we've figured out very useful ways to harness its power, which has changed the world. now that quantum computing is on its way, we have to figure out what kind of things we can do with it. we know it's great at optimization and simulating nature, so we can optimize supply chains and simulate drugs or new materials. but we have barely even scratched the surface of what is possible. the race now is to find algorithms that are practical and possible to run on near-term devices. the problem today isn't how many qubits you can have, we could make a chip with a million qubits tomorrow with the semiconductor tech we already have, but its error correction. just like classical computing went from using faulty vacuum tubes to the fault tolerant transistors, quantum computing needs to have fault tolerant architecture, its own ""transistor moment"". once you can trust that there will be negligible error, the sky becomes the limit. if I were you, I would totally be hyped. it's like we discovered an alien cube and are just trying to figure out what its useful for, the answer could be literally anything. as of now though, its going to be research and deep tech companies racing to find fault tolerant architecture. I would say that a bonafide ""chatgpt"" moment is probably a decade ahead though, but its best to get in now and ride the wave up. but i know that people rarely have the patience for something that takes that long. i think the saying goes ""people overestimate in the short term and underestimate in the long term""",r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1M1NQRUlaRWhUb05EYnRVV1ZsYnU0ZnBHSzB4NHdmR1BrVjFUTkZIWDdOc0UtMFk5dE5pVFB0cEhfSUhBSnFpS1F2TDMyMEF1VHo4aXJIeFh5NmFMajNEak9XSDJjWEpuOGJWbEJzLUdaVUE9

"> random is random

That is absolutely false, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation#True_vs._pseudo-random_numbers . The study of randomness is very complex and is critically important for several areas in computing, particularly cryptography and other areas in cybersecurity. In fact, generating pseudorandom and true-random numbers is an entire subdiscipline (I know personally people who have done entire theses on developing/benchmarking PRNGs). Companies invest significant time and resources in coming up with  [novel sources](https://blog.cloudflare.com/randomness-101-lavarand-in-production/) of [generating entropy](https://blog.cloudflare.com/inside-the-entropy/). 

Quantum RNGs can be high quality sources of true randomness, which are hard to find. Whether or not they are used now is irrelevant, since companies are and have been looking for new high quality, high throughput sources of true randomness. Implementation obstacles can be worked through, especially when there is motivation to work through them (which there obviously is since companies like Toshiba *are* spending money on doing this research).",r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1NkVXT2ZnUzJtdHJQZnE3N3hoczJKRDh0Qk40bkJ6V0dLeF95LTBqYndNVlhib1l0VHJOWTFaV3lPb2tFWTN5ck9MZ2VqY1BRNGJvR0I0amhXeUp2QlBSUFFCOU1Ma29qZkRxbUFKUlU3WHc9

"No, they are completely different technologies. IBM is working on what is usually meant by quantum computers (together with a lot of other companies and universities and whatnot).

Quantum annealing relies on mapping a problem to a Hamiltonian (sorry for the jargon, think of it as an “energy landscape” in which a ball can roll around and find a minimum) and changing that Hamiltonian so that the minimum you find corresponds to the answer you are looking for

I don’t know what you mean with “read out pattern”. A qubit can only give two answers: 1 or 0. If you do the exact same experiment multiple times, yes the statistics of the cases you describe will be different

"The hardware. And more specifically for ""noise"", the superconducting hardware.

The winner of this early era of hardware (in my opinion) is going to be those using the universal elements themselves: trapped ions and neutral atoms (IonQ, Quantinuum, QuEra). There is significantly less overhead in their systems than a superconducting system both in terms of error correction needs and the actual physical manufacturing and footprint of the system. 

I'm all in on IonQ as an investment. I think their all-to-all connectivity of the ion chain, their high coherence times, low error rates, and product roadmap puts them in a strong position to win lots of contracts over the next few years as quantum hardware with high fidelity grows in demand.

Then my hope is there is a synergistic effect - more available hardware makes more applications and uses of the hardware, increasing demand for their hardware and a feedback loop of application + algorithm development on increasing hardware demands.

"First, and I say this with kindness, please use paragraphs. The impact of what you are writing is far less given most people will skip such a wall of text. 

As someone who works in the industry building these systems, I have to pull you up on the claims that it's only noise holding us back from having large-scale qubit systems. That's not true. A big issue right now is the connectivity of the qubits, the nature of the control systems attempting to do interconnects, and the difficulty in maintaining optimised settings in the generation of the starting state, the operations, and especially the measurements.

As things scale up we have to keep solving these problems in new and challenging ways. I've been talking with a chip designing in the classical space who showed me how they are essentially gluing stacks of transistors on top of each other to get around previously impossible to solve limits in quantum tunnelling effects, and it's so inspiring to see such cleverness being possible.

But for us on quantum systems, it's extremely hard at every level of the stack, and noise is just one of many many problems to solve over time. And we're not even sure how effective these theoretical algorithmic advantages really prove to be. Just this month we're seeing debates between specific vendors about whether certain algos work better on their system or the other's. It's important to understand these real-world performances. 

Be excited but be informed. And be patient. It's going to be a long time yet, and we're doing the best we can.",r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2dDNYejlyVE53TzRGRE05ZEc4bXp3TWJ0Q251VjNTOTY2Ukd2ckxib0VSQ21YQkt6b0NGMFNvblhYSGFJNGMxVEtjWmgzRlVidXp2WmM2R0syQVFDTVE9PQ==

"So actually just knowing the qubits are entangled is not enough for that first statement to be true, there are lots of ways for qubits to be entangled. In general if measuring one can tell you any information about the other, they are entangled, but that will not exhibit this exact property. The type of entanglement that satisfies what you've described here sounds like the [Bell state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_state) phi+.

For your 2nd question, since the X and Y basis are orthogonal you will get a completely random result for the 2nd qubit. Assuming the Bell pair 1/sqrt(2)(|00> + |11>), measuring the 1st qubit in the X basis will ""collapse"" the state (actually the idea of ""collapse"" depends on your interpretation, but either way the math works out) such that measuring the 2nd qubit in the Y basis will project to |i+> or |i-> with equal probability.

To see this, observe that 1/sqrt(2)(|00> + |11>) = 1/sqrt(2)(|++> + |-->). Proving the prior is left as an exercise. If we measure the first qubit in the X basis, we get either |+> or |-> as an outcome. That leaves the remaining qubit in exactly the same state as the first, either |+> or |-> depending on measurement outcome. But since |i+> and |i-> have the property that |<i+|+>|^2 = |<i-|+>|^2 = 1/2 (and similar for the ket |->) you are left with random noise.

"Yes there is a metric where we could call this efficient: It's polynomial in the dimension.

We are taking a 2^n dimensional operator and reducing it to 2 and 4 dimensional operators, which requires an exponential number of gates. But that's because we are stating this problem in terms of number of qubits. If instead we stated this in terms of dimension d, we would say that decomposition requires O(d) gates, i.e., its linear in the dimension.

It's a technicality, but I think it's important to realize that the input of this hypothetical algorithm is exponential in size and arbitrary (e.g., perhaps stated as a 2^n x 2^n matrix), and as per usual, if our input is exponential in some variable, most likely the running time (or memory complexity) will be at least that as well.

"One thing i can say is that if you try to design a quantum circuit with some  unitaries that apply to 4 or more qubits (such as k-fold multi controlled rotations), they are NEVER implemented at once on real hardware, and neither they are in quantum simulation environment (like Qiskit, etc. ) actually (maybe with the exception of the CCX Toffoli). They are always decomposed into an exponential number of SU(2)s and CXs with the number of qubits. This might seems ineffective. Well in fact, multi qubit controlled operations that rotate a target qubit's state depending on all possible states of all other controlled qubits in the register (see Uniformly controlled rotations) would be much harder and challenging to implement experimentaly since, for one thing, gates are applied to qubits via microwave pulse sequences and to generate the precise pulse sequence (which would be more complex as more more qubits are implied in the operation) that would have the effect of the multi controlled rotation, long coherence time for states resulting of the complex interaction between matter (qubits) and light (MW signals) must be  achieved. This is because we dont want our state to decohere as we are performing the multi controlled operation. Evidently, NISQ devices are not expected to support long and complex operation. Rather, ppl in the labs have implement pretty performing SU(2)s and CXs (while CX are yet more demanding due to the entanglement property of the gate which has to be traduce in pulse sequence), with quite low errors rate. So.... All this to say, we decompose the k-fold multi controlled operations into an exponential # of SU(2) and CX because it is still more efficient (in term of pulse design, the sequences to apply etc) and less prone to decoherence errors to do so!",r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3SFVkQ0xIbHhUVy1LbU03TzhEUkxpOTg3dk1qLWNzZ1o4eElmMHNVbm5ENVRqYTFzZUZVQnJOR01uTVpjQzdhMXktR2lzTzlvZVpwUkhpYk1JaVpuVThvSzY0azdJRzBndVF0TDhkS0t6ckE9

"The point is that you need the signal to be strong enough to measure at room temperature where you have a background noise because, well, you are at room temperature.


This is reddit, so I'll not go through all the math but a good rule of thumb is that you need 60-80 dB of amplification to detect signal in the few photon regime. 


Now the challenge is to do this without adding more noise. If you just added 80 dB of amplification at room temperature, you will amplify both signal and noise + the noise coming from the amplifier.


So you want to amplify with as low noise temperature as possible. A JPA is lowest noise allowed by quantum mechanics. A HEMT at 4K is also good. Together that's typically 60 dB. Then you need a LNA at room temperature with at least 20 dB of amplification. If you don't have a JPA, then more amp at room temperature is needed",r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3OGdnTjhYUkhpNVFiblZTMnhwdkQyVVhMRW1GeHIycHFyTUFJSHJ6OXQ2TjNzMkIxLWtQSVBaNlhNNTlndjc2R3FmNFpab29LM1p5bGNDZnotbV91VXc9PQ==
"The brown stuff is not a LNA (Low Noise Amplifiers ) but they are attenuators.
Cryostat is like a fridge meaning it as a specific cooling power, so you cannot pump in large amounts of signal into the qubit because the released heat would damage the cryostat. But at the same time you cannot generate the really small signals required for qubits at room temperature without any noise. 

So you include attenuators, but attenuators not only attenuate signal but also add thermal noise photons from the level they attenuate. This means having all the attenuators at the baseplate will be best from noise perspective. But it would mean that a large amount of heat is produced at baseplate. As a compromise it is distributed about the different cooling levels.

Similarly amplifiers also add noise when they amplify signal, so it's better to do it at the coldest temperature. But TWPA (parametric amplifier) actually functions at the single photon limit, so minimal pump signal reaches it.As far as I know, the TWPA pump signal is not attenuated as much as control and measurement signals. This pump signals also produce some heat. This means that all the amplification like TWPA,  HEMT cannot be done at baseplate level. So the second stage amplification is moved to 4K where there is higher cooling power. But once you do that, you again  amplify at room temperature.",r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3Y2Z3VkIzWXJ3VXFQNlJ4SENhaDZIWmRoVkFDa0hRaTk0OV80RHlrNjdQNGVXLUdUOW04V0RZcjRtTXBGNmx3MHMwNVlpYk45VDJoUnZRandWZk95NWc9PQ==
"Hi, thanks for answering. So if I understand correctly, the noise at room temp, or the other stages, would just overwhelm the output response? So if we only amplified at the end our signal would have been lost?

"Like the other commentor mentioned, those brown things in your diagram are not amplifiers. I'll answer the case for both devices since we're all not sure what you're asking about. 

We have attenuators at different stages to suppress thermal photons going down. However, these attenuators work by dissipating the photons to heat, which means more thermal photons (at a different frequency) for the next RF component on the line, as well as a higher thermal load for the cryogenic system at aby particular cooling stage. That's why it's distributed.

For LNAs, it can be shown that any amplifier must necessarily add thermal noise (at minimum half-photon) in order to amplify a signal. This noise corresponds to the temperature of the amplifier. However, we cannot dump too much energy into the JPA as it will start heating up the other components (as well as other engineering and practical reasons). Hence we use a cascaded amplification scheme.",r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3aUlpX2ZVWDNKc1BsTEx0MlM5R3M0dmVQWGtLNnhmZ3BrR0gwcmQ3aVNXaWRFc09KZE5yMW1nSWtTaGxpTDVBR3V4azFMM2Y3Q0FVdkxxaVBHY1V2YVFzZUxEdGRmM0N4Z1hONG5BVzBOYms9
"> So if we only amplified at the end our signal would have been lost?


Yes


> Would similar logic be applied to the attenueators of the RF signal going in?


Yes but with slightly different point. On the input lines, you need to make sure that (thermal) noise at room temperature does not cause noise at your device. So again, you need something like 60 to 80 dB of attenuation on the input lines (and things like eccosorb filters to filter infrared light, but that's a different story)",r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3eXJQblNqSFlQZEFFb1Q2eWNJVlU5dWJmX3oyVTg4ZHE2ZmloV0hRbk03LXNkNWpRR2hCZGduZDMyQkQ2NWVKdE9oUUxVd05pVHFiNDZQS3p2RWxzQ2c9PQ==

"These answers are super on point haha. But you can model the signal going to a different state as a beam splitter/combiner with the signal at one port and thermal noise at the other port, and the combined signal at the output. Amplification/attenuation at each stage allows you to amplify the most signal compared to noise.

"JPA or TWPA only provides a 15-25 dB gain, this is a low gain from a typical 1st stage amplifier, thus, 2nd stage LNA may contributes a sizeable amount of noise. Thus why not use a LNA at 4k, 4K HEMT is hot, so lets place it at 4K. 
- after 4K, your room temp LNA wont affect your SNR anymore. If your 1st stage amplifier can be good enough, like 40-50 dB, you can go all the way to room temp LNA.

You’re right I am unfamiliar with connection between the two, I was referring to cryptography which both parallel , so idk

One of the big allures of quantum computing is the ability quantum cryptography . Advancement in this field would break current cryptography rules because they kind find other routes than a brute force method, to my understanding . Is that incorrect ? 

I know a little that period finding is more efficient using QFT but my understanding of the math is limited so feel free to correct me if I say something dumb.

"There are no room-temperature SQUIDs because SQUIDs are superconducting and there are no room temperature superconductors. The instrument you linked to is a Quantum Design MPMS. It's a magnetometer, used to measure the induced magnetic moment of a sample in response to an applied magnetic field. The SQUID is a Superconducting QUantum Interference Device and it's used as a very sensitive detector of magnetic fields. It is kept at very low temperature (probably around that of liquid helium), but the chamber the sample is in can vary from 1.9 to 500 K. The instrument is, thus, useful for measuring magnetic properties of a material over a wide temperature range. Instruments like this are the workhorse of many condensed matter physics laboratories. I don't know how much this particular instrument costs, but it would be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

"Matrix multiplication by unitary matrices are trivial in quantum mechanics. Any standard operation on a quantum system is in effect a unitary transformation. I'm not sure about general classes of matrix products though. 

There are quantum algorithms to do basic (scalar) multiplication, but the suffer from scalability due to the high overhead of logical ancilla qubits needed. I suppose a simple extension to matrix multiplication would involve extending the logical qubits to d-bits (bigger Hilbert spaces), but don't quote me on this, I'm just thinking off the top of my head. 

Very high dimension matrix multiplication can also be done in multiplexed photonic systems, which is kind of quantum and way more scalable, so you might be interested in that.

"Matrix multiplication is trivial on quantum computers. If you have circuit 1 which represents unitary matrix 1 and circuit 2 which represents unitary matrix 2, to multiply these you just do circuit 1 and then circuit 2 (or vice-versa). The problems you’ll run into are  

1. You can’t directly access the matrix you’ve created. You can make “observations” about it (ex observing a single entry, computing a quadratic form with the matrix) but you won’t have access to the whole matrix as a classical observer

2. Block-encoding, or creating efficient circuits to represent the unitary matrices you want to multiply. If your matrices are unstructured or random, then these circuits are crazy inefficient. If they do have structure though, then you might be able to create some slick circuits. This is what my research is in

"Hi everyone, I am an 18 year old with a strong interest in pursuing a career in quantum computing. I have completed [Pearson BTEC Level 3](https://qualifications.pearson.com/en/qualifications/btec-international-level-3.html) in Information Technology (Vocation training equivalent to grade 11 and 12) instead of traditional Grade 11 and 12 education (Worst mistake in my life), which means my background in math and physics is limited to Grade 10 level. But after completing my vocational training, last month, I have been revising Grade 10 level math and physics, because in the past 2 years, I forgot most of the stuffs.

Given my situation, I'm looking for advice on the following:

1. Which specific topics in mathematics and physics should I focus on to prepare for a career in quantum computing and for university?
2. Are there any recommended online courses or resources (preferably at the Grade 11 & 12 level) that can help me build a strong foundation in Math and Physics for my quantum computing career?
3. How can I obtain certifications or credentials that universities will recognize, given that I can't go back to traditional high school?
4. Any advice on balancing the learning of foundational subjects with starting to explore quantum computing concepts?

Any guidance, course recommendations, or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks to all of you for your help!

Some extra information on Pearson BTEC: Pearson BTEC is a vocational training program provided by Pearson. It consists of multiple levels, with Level 3 equivalent to Grades 11 and 12. The entire program spans two years (I took the Extended Diploma, so it lasted for 2 years), during which they teach programming and other IT-related subjects.",r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYMWQzS29BbWdNdVNKcVIwMzlKN1ljMF85dDRFZWFCWkJYYUlidmJZZVNPd2J1WF9ZQ0QyWU1aRXQ1eWxwVXB0SEpPMlZaa2VVZGRlVzhYMk5PQzc0clE9PQ==
"No, I mean the code for basic multiplication and addition of real numbers. Like an Abelian group.

This is just a bitwise classical replacement for an AND gate.

I.e. in order to do so, you must use quite a bit of width as you want your qubit readout (say 1 byte of them) to read of a functional number. You need a QFT, some QRAM, etc.

This makes it into quite a beefy code.",r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYbmlSWmlEXzJ5TFFpNUxEMXFreUgtVklhRVJlb2ZSZ1FxZVFqZFdZVzJ5YUw3NW9aV1g3cXFNdU5wZFNjNkVIemNsb2NpTjdSdEJfam12WWljTUE1YWc9PQ==
"I can easily take the example that someone else made with the classical AND gate. As a counter example. 

First off, that Toffoli gate, as nice and universal as it may seem, is not the gate run in the hardware. In reality this code is not 2 operations deep, but probably 3 or more swaps, and 10 rotations or so. Because that is what has the best resulting gate fidelities. 

So let's assume that a real compiled code is 14 gate operations deep. IBM boasts a circuit speed of 1400 clops, so that means this code runs in 10 milliseconds.  This will never be all that much faster as that is not how the physics on the chip work...

The traditional AND gate requires 2 transistors sequentially, the MOSFET switching speed is about 30 nanoseconds. Meaning the classical AND gate 60 nanoseconds. 

This makes this example gate, which I did not choose myself, about 166000 times slower.

You CAN code anything from a classical computer on a quantum computer, but it is NOT without extra cost. It is NOT universally better.",r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYeXhMRElNb25YSktuUEpQZkpvWXMxY21sUFlib0lBWGlrRDBBamNMZXd4ZE02cTRheHFqTVNxdzAtUU1EbmY2Zk1UOWVnN1drQXNTaE5NSHpCeHcwS3c9PQ==
"If you measure a qubit, then you collapse the state into the measurement outcome.


230 ns is abysmally short. Great science to get anything to work at room temperature. However this is a qubit at GHz frequencies. If you need qubit fidelities that are respectable, operation times most be sub-nanoseconds which are impossible.


For initialization, your feedback loop should also be on the order of a nanosecond. Practically impossible.


The biggest issue though is that they did not have individual qubit control. Everytime is done over an ensemble of qubits similar to NMR experiments in the 90s. For any feedback to work, you need individual access to individual qubits with hard fidelity. They are nowhere near that",r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYMlhyYXM2S09zMHluRGN5bEcyUVVfbm1JWTZtLUZaS1ZsRUlNSkFsS0NJbjNDRF9tUHN5MzJBTlVYdUh2eWJwUUdvYlprbWZXSVNqUC14dFRsOU1NZ2c9PQ==

"I think the confusion comes from the fact that many learning literature propose Grover as an algorithm for ""searching in an unordered database"", and refer to the database as a blackbox; even if the definition is not incorrect, IMHO it's counter-intuitive in explaining what Grover does.

"Usually, the ""dissipative"" version of Hamiltonians are [Lindbladians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindbladian). They're pretty complicated when working in continuous time, but luckily for any fixed time t, the evolution of a Lindbladian corresponds to some [quantum channel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_channel) in the same way that evolution by a Hamiltonian for a fixed time t corresponds to some unitary. Furthermore, by [Stinespring's theorem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stinespring_dilation_theorem), any quantum channel is can be described as a unitary applied to a larger Hilbert space with some ancilla registers that get traced out. In summary, you can simulate quantum evolution with dissipation for a fixed time with plain old quantum circuits, but you do have to do some math to figure out which unitaries correspond to the evolution.",r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMERDLXRzTndyM2tuVjFSVWRLSTBWQlU0UDctekQ2Y242czFhSG5JUGliZVFpVnB0Vk9NdDZsSU1IaUxMZjRmdjZ1ZHI2NzJwZkZ6SDZ2bEVzbk5zWXc9PQ==
"There are several ways to do it, though it is hard in general assuming you were able to map your Non-hermitian hamiltonian onto a lindbladian you can follow the prescription in https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11962 . Generally your non hermitian process may not be something you can map onto a lindbladian in the usual sense, but you could map it onto a pseudo lindbladian on an enlarged space. The technique is called pseudomodes however you are most likely going to end up with unphysical parameters you cannot put on to a quantum computer and would need to do something along the lines of this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15240

In practice though most popular non hermitian Hamiltonians you encounter come from a lindbladian, they are usually an approximated form of linbladians where you neglect energy conserving jumps and you could use the first prescription :)",r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMGlUREpWVDVLM0tvZktYV3g1S2pPWVQyNG5rWnA5ZU9LTDBZSzZsY3hfYTZOYnJsaV9LWW12RHVlZll3REVweEdZTlVfdVA0d1UtYU5mOEZnazhnakNuSUZodDRqelVQN0F1QVJpbFhWUmc9

"Superposition is a mathematical term wherein two solutions of a linear differential equation can be added. Here, it's kinda the same, so it's purely a mathematical artefact, but for physical intuition, you can imagine it to be a new state that can be interpreted as 0 and 1 at the same time, and the coefficients accompanying the terms are related to the probability. In your case, when Hadamard acts on 0 or 1, it creates a superposition of 0 and 1 (one with the same phase and another with the opposite phase).",r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhaGxhNzZVVlRYMXEtQlZBRUhUbW53aU5yb2FHdkIwTWxzTTJHSXJ1SmVuX3RGY2t2TFRmUXdpeDhtdS1aZDBTYWViOW1hNHR4NUt2NEd4T0JmYXI0WWc9PQ==
Quick dumb question: how does this happen in the SC architecture? QM says energy is discrete so there is this JJ which causes anharmonic potential separating out |0> and |1> and uses this as the 2 level system. When we say one applies H gate to get |+> but nothing can be between|0> and |1> so what's happening there?,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhZk1pcGtfcmRoN3BNZDNwZUk5M0ZTaGF5YlZ2M0xOb1N3UjhmNGRvMXFiZEJFbk5TLWVISHBXZkNSd1VZMnJtRnp3X3JMYjFTRzlHX0xBRkFLZjQ2LWc9PQ==
"Both are sort of true. There is a little bit of both states in there, but the state is neither |1> nor is it |0>. There are infinitely many superposition states, but all of them have some overlap with |1> or |0>. 

As an analogy, if you travel at a 45 degree heading towards the northeast, are you going north or east, or both? Are you traveling exactly north, or exactly east, or neither? 

There is a direction (in this analogy, a state) which is not exactly the same as the directions North and East (|0> and |1>), and yet is a little bit of both (superposition).",r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhc0tPQ3dsX0dxSkgzZzg3TWFhYm94REMySlFSX3prLVRXMXB4TnlNMk81ZU5JbEZlNjV3MjlWNHBwejl3X0VWUzJyeGdaMGZsS0o4THo5X0hJTmtXR0E9PQ==
"Microwave pulses are applied to the qubit in such a way that it has a 50% chance of being measured as either 0 or 1. It either absorbs the discrete amount of energy or it doesn't, and you find out which happened afterwards when observing. 


The state before you measure is a superposition, which doesn't have a good physical interpretation. It can only be understood probabilistically, so what is called the ""energy"" of the superposition state is really just the average value of the two energy states.",r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhQ0U1bHVaRlZUSTJSbmtLd0xtVmtLLUJiYTMtQlBJN2pncmtMOGN3ZFJlSG9qcHlLaFBGSTh1T05WU05lLTAwZVFyWkhhaHYyaGRPSHRxTG5BU2FQQ2c9PQ==
"In this case you create the gate with a microwave tone whose frequency matches the frequency difference between the 0 and 1 State.
