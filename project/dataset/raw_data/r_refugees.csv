"Hi everyone! I’m posting this for a friend who doesn’t have Reddit. She’d like your opinions on the piece linked above. Here’s the context:

“I wrote this story for an online publication about motherhood and that it’s been hard to write because of the woman’s refugee status in the story. I don’t want to write anything that would harm the refugee community, but leaving out the woman’s status also felt white washed and fraudulent. After writing it, doing edits, and having in depth discussions with fellow writers about it, I gave it to my editor. She decided it’s best not to include the woman’s refugee status at all. But I feel uncomfortable that this choice was made my a bunch of white people who may just be reacting based on issues with white fragility. I’d like input from the actual refugee community.”",r/refugees,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSQXNscC1RakY5ajlhUTRxZm5yaFktTXRmdER0dUpTZHZjc19YMUNDNk9kX1ZyMTd1N0pRbGhwLWZoeW12YnBkdnE2YXd5NWtaa1NWNjJ4Qk5rZVdQcGc9PQ==

"How would you know somebody's citizenship status just by looking at them?  This woman could be a refugee, an immigrant on a fiancée visa, a skilled tech worker on an H visa, or someone with temporary protected status.  If this is a true story, you had no way of knowing.  If it's fiction, your narrator is leaping to weird conclusions. 

In this story, you are perpetuating some of the worst possible stereotypes about refugees---that all of them are Muslim, that they are mentally ill or violent.  None of those things are true.

The only thing we learn from this story is that the author is a privileged white woman with some deeply engrained prejudices.   Also, the trauma plot is super, super tired.",r/refugees,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSSjNGOGxqbEhHTVhXREE2dDFzQWRsSS1OcFJTcE5xeGZxd1VYbDhncldtWnlXSXFCdkUxeGF1c0RFMF8tUE9lT0U0RUJqeXFyTGNMMmJSWFJEWERlMUE9PQ==
"Honestly, as someone who is neither a refugee, nor white, nor Muslim, I felt extremely uncomfortable reading your story.

I cannot begin to fathom how difficult nearly losing your child is. But your characterization of the refugee woman rings extremely hollow.

1. You included her refugee status off the bat, meaning that is her primary identifier, based on your internal biases (and yes, your gut linked her behavior to “refugee” — if it had been a white person who happened to be a refugee, would you have made that assumption?) 

2. You pontificate on her (possible) trauma — your act of sympathy is using a refugee stereotype of trauma-induced violent mental health issues. It’s an attempt on your part to pardon her actions, but it’s analogous to a hard boiled detective in the 1950’s noir film going “the dame went hysterical, it’s the nature of women to be emotional, bless her poor soul, but she really can’t do that.”

Honestly, unless you go and interview her (if she is willing, and able to consent), you aren’t in a qualified position to tell this story in a way that wouldn’t harm refugees; you simply don’t have the general knowledge or specific awareness of the refugee person involved. As a result, you’re filling in the holes with stereotypes; harmful ones, at that. 

It is still your story to tell— you lived it— but be aware that you can and will cause damage to another vulnerable group. Imagine the 1950’s hard oiled detective telling the “hysterical dame’s” side of the story as well. 

I appreciate your intention to seek guidance, but sometimes the guidance is to defer writing it, until you overcome your own prejudices through actively educating yourself. Alternatively, re-write, anonymizing the woman. Refer to her as “a woman”, since you can’t in good conscience provide full characterization from the refugee identity.

Last of all, I’m sorry that you were subject to having you and your son threatened with harm.",r/refugees,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSWHNDemhEV3ZYM1JjMThpZkNqS2xJWC1OR0M0VjVzU1B4MElwUnpkQ2FENVhvUFgxbU1nQVhQNmh3OTVTYW5WZld3VVRaemhXTjJVaDlOeS1MbUs0aUE9PQ==

"I just moved from Ukraine to the US. One of the biggest issues I’m having is places in the US assume we are fraudulent and blocking new accounts we open. 

PayPal is now accepted in Ukraine, so we’ve just kept using our Ukrainian banks. We have an account in hyrvnia and one on dollar, so it’s easy to transfer money to ourselves. 

Also, opening an account depends on type of visa as well, so it really depends on the bank. Different ones want different IDs. 

I opened a US bank account with Lili. It’s online and easy. Works for me. Maybe a “prepaid account” might work, but in our case, it’s been easiest to keep our Ukrainian bank. PrivatBank.

"No need to apologize.

I’m not an expert, but here are some of my thoughts. 

The US is huge. Ukraine is one of the largest countries in Europe and Ukraine is the size of Texas, if that gives perspective. I think because of the size, lack of public transportation, and affordability…refugees and immigrants often end up in major cities. 

Larger cities tend to have more resources, yet more people. There could be a select amount of resources available and depending the amount of displaced persons…it may be more or less easy to access those resources depending the situation. 

I’ve noticed that “red tape” could also be an issue. Sometimes if resources require a lot of time, energy, documents required from the person needing assistance…it might seem impossible and they look elsewhere.

I also think freedom of speech has advantages and disadvantages. People publicly voice their opinions and that can be intimidating and overwhelming for people that need assistance. Maybe a person would not ask for help because they fear of becoming a meme or publicly humiliated. 

With that, I’d say the US is far from united. There are so many groups of people in the United States and it seems that a lot of them are relying on each other to feel safe. Makes sense. At the same time, It also means that a lot of people are more likely to help people that look like them. 

Capitalism seems to have taken a turn for the worse as well. Nothing is for free or given out of kindness. The government, charities, and even religions have become more like businesses. 

When we arrived in the USA, the amount of ads was overwhelming. It feels like they scare you into buying things you don’t need like insurance. IMO, I’m not going to pay a company to possibly pay me for something that may never happen. It makes more sense to me to put my money in a savings account. 

Anyway (I got sidetracked), it’s like the US tries to keep people (usually POC or low income) in debt. So, I feel like displaced persons that truly need help aren’t sure who to trust or don’t know how they can access the resources available to them.  

Some other things that come to mind: racism, language, culture

Again, I’m not a professional or have no real data supporting my thoughts. I’m just assuming and basing off of my experiences so far.",r/refugees,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSejNTX0FjaVBhSFFGUVNILTZ4dXZhekN0X0t2Q2l1alY2UXRUNDB0QU9UdmhWeVJjWE5meUtRbVExQ1F0ZHNqbXM4ZzdWVWRzdnBlRGViTnJjR1VXakE9PQ==

"The primary reason?  It's not a priority for the people who would give the aid.

For some, they are struggling to put food on the table themselves.  So their priority isn't other people.  Others the priority is to the people already here.  Others it is a priority for those they consider need the help the most.  For others it is a priority to give to those who will also keep our citizens safe.

I am big on helping displaced people and I think that we as a nation can help a whole lot more and still help our own citizens, but like it or not we are not a bottomless pit of money and 300 million people including children and people all on welfare are going to have a difficult time taking care of 100 million displaced people if we had to do it all on our own.  So I think it is ok to validate some of those fears of making displaced people the top on the priority list, but still help others to understand what is going on and encourage them to help despite those fears.

I think the second reason is a lack of knowledge.  You don't have to spend much time with government leaders to find out that even those who are liberal often don't have a clue as to what happens with displaced people.  Or don't understand the differences in refugees versus asylum seekers versus parolees versus illegal aliens versus sponsored etc.  Or don't understand the security processes.

Well, this is a pure guess, not based on experience: I will bet you that they would not be willing to accept your interpretation of your documentation. They probably will, however, accept the documentation itself.  They just would want to provide their own interpreter to make sure that the documentation is exactly what you say it is.",r/refugees,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSSk42dG5SUDRkV2lwQ2pZaDhySG5idko5bHFwYjRBY1djM0NQdUsyMHJINDcwMGJhLVhHaC1lWGVvbjNhUV9SX3lVSjJsTnBUTDdHb0NsNFgyeU40MkE9PQ==
"I have two thoughts.

1)  Have someone else review and verify the translation of your supporting documents.  Even my wife did that and she was the vice-chair of her Linguistics Department at the college in her native country where she was employed to teach English.  She also served as professional translator and interpreter.  Still, she had one of her subordinates verify the document translation.

2) I would absolutely ask for a translator for any interview unless you are completely bilingual.  Let someone else that is more bilingual than you worry about getting the translation/interpretation correct so you can completely focus on formulating the most truthful and accurate answers in the language you are most comfortable in.",r/refugees,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJST0Zwd0VyUEpheG8yOFFjS05ZLWtTdUljN2c5QXNzRDFBYVJDRS1TMnJSVGdfb21BdDhxWVlsUzVoeXliZENXQlpUSUxicE9rZ0RtMDlURFItWnNpeGFDMkI0Sjlzcm9uWHVnZjlackFEcXM9
"In Poland situation is morally difficult.

Refugees come for Belarus from all around the world.

They are in poor health and mostly DO NOT want to stay in Poland.

So - in theory - there should be no problem in accepting them.

BUT

1. Accepting them would mean that MORE people would follow
2. Each of those people PAY regimes in Belarus nad Moscow to get there.
3. Those regimes USE that money for weapons and waging WAR ON UKRAINE

So we (Poland) are in sittuation where letting refugees from Belarus in = paying for massacre of civilians in Ukraine.

CURRENT APPROACH

Building the wall was not meant to STOP migration but to make it harder to avoid capture.

After capture you are either deported OR detained for months/years until YOUR COUNTRY accepts you back (no Germany). And od course data gather ( so even if you somehow get to EU you are deported).

**Current approach is built around killing hope that going through Belarus would EVER result in building life in EU.**

"You have a better reason than most ""asylum seekers"" right now. More than likely, you'll be let in. But you won't have a court date for like 5 years.

You also won't be able to work for a year. But you'll be safe — which is your main priority. Our asylum process is designed to protect you, not help you get a job, which is why most migrants come here.

If you want safety, then we have what you need. We'll feed you and shelter you until you're able to work. It is very difficult to get deported from the US even if your asylum application is rejected.

As an alternative, Mexico is underrated for asylum. You can begin working much quicker in Mexico than in the US. But you need to stay in the safe areas of Mexico.

Jobs in Mexico pay less but the cost of living is cheaper. Americans are actually migrating to Mexico to escape our cost of living. It's at crisis levels. Ideally, you want a remote job in the US while living in Mexico so that you have the American income with the Mexican cost of living.

Canada is an option too but they are stricter than US and Mexico.
