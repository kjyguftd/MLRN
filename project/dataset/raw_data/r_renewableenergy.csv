"Public utilities are not doing us any favors because the potential savings are never sold as a benefit; too many renewables projects are presented as still needing more infrastructure, additional expenses, and regulatory hurdles that never translate into savings on a utility bill.

I've converted my home, removing all fossil fuels and adding solar to meet demand so that in the middle of a heatwave, I'm still feeding back to the grid while running A/C, powering an EV, and using the induction stove.

However, our local utility companies are now charging nearly 50% more than five years ago to compensate for their natural gas-powered base-load systems while wind power is coming online in the region. 

As if the rising bills weren't enough, the pressure to go all-electric adds another layer of financial strain. The promise of cost savings with renewable energy is slipping further away, making the transition to a more sustainable energy feel like a distant dream.

Many people believe ""drill baby drill"" is a good idea. In that case, the selling is based on the false notion that cheaper gas will result. Instead, it will accelerate the consumption of the easiest-to-recover oil, leaving us vulnerable to future shortages of cheaper oil. With this policy, demand continues to rise, and the domestic supply steadily becomes more expensive. Eventually, more affordable oil will only be available from foreign suppliers, and the dependency cycle will worsen.

">Researchers in Spain have investigated the potential of using photovoltaic (PV) or photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) systems in microbreweries and have found that PVT systems can cover more energy demand but have a longer payback time.

A PV system has an efficiency around 20% for turning light into electricity.  A solar thermal system is 70-80% efficient at turning light into heat.  The solar- thermal system can be knocked together out of standard plumbing parts, glass panes, and black paint.  The PV system has to originate in an incredibly sophisticated factory.   It is strange to contemplate that the product of the incredibly sophisticated supply chain that leads to PV modules is so much cheaper to connect that it has a faster payback time, compared to highly engineered custom plumbing.  Perhaps in the near future, the skillset for this specialized plumbing will be widespread and the implementation will be cheaper.  Or, perhaps heat pump water heaters will be so efficient that it will outcompete solar thermal at this scale.

"They’re using clever language to make it seem like they’re running entirely on renewables all the time. They’re just using Virtual Power Purchasing Agreements (VPPAs). In order for a solar/wind plant to get financing, they need a guaranteed rate from an offtaker (in this case Amazon). 

How it works:

Amazon will agree to pay the solar plant 10 cents per kWh (for example) for every kWh that the solar plant produces

The solar plant then produces energy when the sun is up and sends it to the grid. There are no wires directly attached to Amazon’s offices or data centers. Amazon pulls electricity from the grid just as it would have without the financial agreement with the solar plant. 

If the solar plant produces 1,000 kWh in a year and Amazon uses 1,000 kWh in a year then Amazon claims that all of their energy needs came from renewable sources even though they just pulled from the grid.

Even though this is greenwashing, VPPAs do provide stable financing for solar/wind projects that might not have gotten built had they had to rely on selling their power into wholesale markets and competing with other solar/wind projects when it’s sunny/windy out 🤷‍♀️",r/renewableenergy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXbWQzdWVLTnU1T2VFQlBvQ2tsdnpsSzdrTkw4WXFRNktnTnpXX1FiLWxmS1liNS1ySEJNR0VqNWRGZ1dFT0lRUDI4eU9zQkJSUk1xaUFkN2lRVnNOdzhHd09ybzBFVGhUYkxCR0RHQmlwNU09
"I realize it's fashionable to shit on Amazon, but in their report, Amazon explicitly says they use a combination of onsite renewables, direct investment in renewable projects, and PPAs to contribute to their goal.  It's not exactly greenwashing when they tell you what they're going to do, then do that thing they said they would do.

It's reasonable to question whether PPAs are effective, but renewable energy developers have attested to PPAs being vital to securing financing and making their projects viable.  Big tech (and other) companies have different core competencies than power generation companies.

"I agree that PPAs have been crucial to the exponential growth we’ve seen in renewables deployment, but when Amazon adds a datacenter to the grid, it’s still adding energy demand that wasn’t there to begin with, even if all that energy is “offset” with solar power.

Let’s say Amazon builds a 200 MW datacenter in California that consumes 200 MW at all times throughout the year. They also build a 1000 MW solar plant in California. For simplicity let’s assume the annual MWh consumed by the datacenter equals the annual MWh produced by the solar plant, so all of the electricity of the datacenter is “offset” by the solar plant

When the sun is out, the solar plant sends 200 MW to the datacenter, covering its load, and send the remaining 800 MW to the grid. When the sun is out, the 800 MW being sent to the grid isn’t replacing power that would’ve been created by fossil fuels, because California already has enough solar during the day. Then at night, there’s 200 additional MW that have to be produced by fossil fuels because of the demand of the datacenter.

When fossil fuels are the main source of energy for the grid, adding marginal load results in dirtier, less efficient power plants producing more energy. Adding additional flat load to the grid results in increased emissions even though all the electricity is “offset”",r/renewableenergy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXNnlvYXo1VWhjek5kcVNoNTRuQktOR0ZGckh1SHZpT1EyYXhRTnZaYnhxdEx1cm5FakNiZ1MzbWk0VnRBMUZCelBMcFF4alc2VmRjVm8tWExmM2ZHZWU0SkNpemc2RDk1RzF6UkhhMDllVWc9

"""International dumping"" accusations require lower export than domestic prices to be valid.  I'm unaware of any valid ""international dumping"" accusation against China.

National (resource) security requires domestic/peaceful sourced abundance.  US does this with food, energy, steel subsidies to some extent, but the lobby political structure focuses on oligarchist profit boosting, and creating global scarcity through war/threats.

The US does create food abundance with subsidies in one of its few remaining export sectors.  Canada is far worse in its supply management (dairy) and protectionist policies, but it can be argued, that better quality is the result.

Steel/iron is not geopolitically susceptible.  Too easy to produce anywhere.  Like batteries and solar, lumber and other minerals, cheap steel is a stockable commodity that provides massive industralization/construction boosts compared to expensive steel.

Instead of false dumping accusations for stockable goods, buy all of them and store them strategically, including funding domestic production capacity/subsidies from profit in selling them to US manufacturing/construction.

Instead of warmongering insecurity, security requires cheap stockpiles and production capacity if there is ever a threat to those stockpiles getting depleted, usually only due to warmonging evil.
