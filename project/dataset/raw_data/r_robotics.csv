">General AI for all environments and any hardware? People are having a hard time mastering 1 environment on a very controlled set of hardware.

Counter-intuitively, this is how deep learning works: it requires enough diversity and complexity, before it can generalize well enough.

Exhibit 1: [ImageNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageNet), which was the largest image dataset that spawn the computer vision revolusion. Its size was the reason it all started to work.

Exhibit 2: [RT-X aka Robot Transformer X.](https://robotics-transformer-x.github.io/) I quote: *""We assemble a dataset from 22 different robots collected through a collaboration between 21 institutions, demonstrating 527 skills (160266 tasks). We show that a high-capacity model trained on this data, which we call RT-X, exhibits positive transfer and improves the capabilities of multiple robots by leveraging experience from other platforms"" and ""RT-1-X models outperform RT-1 or Original Methods trained on individual datasets by 50% in the small-data domain""* - essentially, with added diversity of tasks, performance on individual tasks improved.",r/robotics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYd1E0N0N4RGQta05pOWYzczRlRGFfT0dnc0NFblNzb0NRS0tTb200eDVMMDU0YURybVZPUXcxVlpYZlNJNWlhQXVFdkhuemFVMDUwb0RIbS1WMlU4ZWc9PQ==

"Not sure if this is a troll post based on the dodge background…  also not sure if you mean ‘control’ like how to wire and code or what is the best conceptual approach.  If it’s wire/code you’ll need at least one other component to drive the servos (it’s not recommended to power servos straight from the arduino board as it can’t provide enough amps).  You can either buy an i2c servo controller or a servo hat or something similar.  As for coding, just ask chat gpt to do it for you! I use it all the time.  If it’s a conceptual control question, you could try accelerometers (sounds complicated) or a bunch of potentiometers that read angle of your joints.

"Yes, you can buy a simple ""wall wart"" 6-volt DC adapter power supply. A 5-volt one is fine too, but the motors will move a little slower. A switching supply is more compact than a transformer-based one. You just need to figure out how much current you need. The best way to do that is to hook it up to the battery and measure it with a multimeter while operating. Probably around 2-3 amps will be good, if the servos don't stall. Alternatively, you might be able to use a 2.5 A USB adapter.",r/robotics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZMDVqWTNBemZxNEg4VW9rU1lUUWZxNnZkakhxdjQtZG1IRG9PT2lvaGswekFSS1R6THVpOTVVcmx1ZXR5TndZMVdzS0xVZFpRLS03Q01kdHI2ZTRxLVE9PQ==

"What you will actually be working on will determine which things are gaps or unnecessary. There are lots of topics within robotics and calculus/kinematics/dynamics only apply to some of them.

That said, the kinematics course that I took in my undergrad, as an ME, was a biomed engineering graduate course. The dynamics exposure I got was simple planar or rotational RBD which was not terribly useful since it gets way more complex when things become 3D.

"Your best bet is not to use batteries... there are tons of christmas lights that are powered via wires, there's very little reason not to just run a cable to it. 

Draining a battery isn't going to kill the motors or servos. Probably. Unless you really abuse the battery and it catches fire. 

2x 6V 2000mAh getting drained in 30 minutes means you had 4000mAh of capacity... Draining it at 2c would kill it in around 30m. That's 8A average. That doesn't sound right. To me, that means you are not sure the actual power draw or the capacity for your 2x 6V pack was not 4000mAh. 

So you can do one of two things. For 4 hours, you should calculate your average draw, and then get 4x that draw in battery capacity. So if you draw on average 1A, then you need 4000mAh to last 4 hours.

Or you can plug it into the wall and use a 6V supply rated for your peak (not average) current. That would be basically summing each motor's max draw (or if you want to get fancy, group the motors into which ones will be on at a given time, and size the supply for the maximum of each of the groups - since not every motor is on all the time). Then it just doesn't die.",r/robotics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZNjFXQU1VSklyR2t5clBHOGQ2U0R0TWFDMG53Ynl3OF94S1Qzb1FnYXdJZWVOTjZHR3hhLXM1WUJhSWRlMFU2Ty0xeDg0ZUFuYWN3QnZ0T2dvczN4RGc9PQ==

"My advice, unhappy though it may be, is to curb your expectations somewhat. The idea discussing jellyfish tentacles and such IS a great one, but it's going to be QUITE complex to do. You won't be able to do more normal styles of kinematics on it (forward/inverse) because all the things you've likely been taught (making assumptions about your classes, apologies) will have probably assumed rigid linkages with specific pivot points.

What you may want to do in that vein is start with ONE tentacle, possibly even slightly oversized, and get a design that gives you the flexibility you desire but also can be characterized in some way so your control system can make a prediction about how to get from A to B.

Bonus points, if you really want something interesting with that approach, find a way to design your control system so that it can have a length along the arm specified for where to consider the end effector. Namely, imagine the difference between trying to place the tip of the tentacle, vs placing the space five inches further back, because the tentacle length at the tip is curled around things.

Bonus bonus points, if your software/hardware can utilize different lengths of the tentacle for different usecases and switch between them dynamically.",r/robotics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNadHZpTndrT2xaRjNoM091QkY5MFMzWHBJdS1JcUw0RVdLeHVoQ0lwNi1PYXRjSzJ4TlZKTmc1bEh3eGZhUjdHRzhVcnpvZ0oxSUxfOVRIYVg5TVBDYkE9PQ==

"Very tight tolerance and factory calibration.
Each axis has an encoder that is accurate up to 3,4, of 5 decimal places (1000th of a degree or better!)

Before a robot is shipped from the factory, it is mastered using specifically designed jig, and the encoder values are saved to a master file, usually paired to the arms serial number.

If you look, most robots, especially large industrial ones only claim repeatability up to .03 to 0.5mm. (remember each joint is measure to the 1000th or better.)

This is important!  Repeatability vs Accuracy! 

Most robots are taught using dead reckoning, which replies on REPEATABILITY. 

You move a robot to a position, and TEACH that position. The robot will then return to that position within the given Repeatability tolerance. 

Accuracy is more like, Here are specific measurements, go exactly there. Accuracy is not typically used in robot systems.  Even in most vision guided system, there is a frame of reference taught (dead reckoning) that reduces the area in which the robot needs to be ""accurate"".

The robots come from the factory with some default mastering either by a jig or vision (as another person stated above).

It really comes down to what the application calls for. For example, welding typically requires more repeatability than say palletizing boxes.

i am not going to mention all the things now that has to be done in the future, where complete different environments require new challenges.

the high price tag you mentioned is an argument...let me tackle this one, too:  
cell phones and even smartphones were incredible expensive when they came out first. only privileged and wealthy people could afford one. but they quickly became affordable, not just by mass production but by smart marketing strategies. instead of selling the devices, they were given away almost for free, but with a contract attached. in that way average people with income were able to afford a mobile phone. i see something similar coming for personal robots, not only will people consume them, they will make money out of them as well. if personal computers can provide a potential income by creating software for it then why not robots as well. the software market for robots will be magnitudes larger than the software market for computers we know today. now you certainly want your software to run not just on one specialised model only. thats why i bought a standard PC and not an apple or commodore computer.

look at the current market for cars. they may look different to you but basicly the same technology is used - standard tires, standard wipers, standard lightbulbs, standard engine oil, standard fuel(where to refuel a car that runs on methanol or ammoniac??). there are some exceptions, of course. but these are not to the advantage of the enduser.",r/robotics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaU1FnaDVHR09xcTBNdlVZTlN3dlpPNUJZaXRIY0xOUjZIeUFRZUdVSjhGZHBEdGhOekx1alI5dTBTMUlYcks3dEZvN21aMEFEY2xfTTNheG94Uy15d0E9PQ==

"The answer to your question is less technical in the robotics sense and more of a socioeconomic discussion in my opinion. 

The general public is quite hesitant with respect to robots taking jobs from people. The coffee shop employees would likely feel that their jobs are directly threatened.

I’ve also seen that even highly skilled technical workers are hesitant to interact with robots due to being uncomfortable around them. 

Robots are also expensive capital purchases. I’m not sure what the ROI on one of those would be in a coffee shop. 

The only technical reason I can see for not having robots in coffee shops as you describe is maintenance.

What's your concern with using aluminum? Misumi makes extrusions that go as small as 15 or 20mm square and don't need any special tools other than a chop saw to cut it to length.

"You will most likely want to use aluminum as your metal of choice because it is strong and lightweight. 6061 is a common alloy and is used in a wide variety of applications. 

An aluminum tube type product might do what you want. I’d strongly encourage you to prototype with 3D printing first since it’s cheaper and faster to iterate on designs than metal based prototypes in my experience.

"Bilateral teleoperation is a concept that involves two-way communication where both the operator and the remote device send and receive feedback. The operator controls the device remotely and receives sensory feedback (such as force) from the device to adjust their actions.  
  
The two arms are virtually coupled to each other, allowing either to act as the master (the haptic interface) or the slave (the manipulator) in the system. We are not using a force sensor at the motors but are relying on proprioception.  
  
All the code is here in the examples folder: [https://github.com/PCrnjak/Spectral-BLDC-Python/tree/main](https://github.com/PCrnjak/Spectral-BLDC-Python/tree/main)  
  
Each arm uses a 2x Spectral micro BLDC driver + a gimbal motor. Then those 2 motors are connected in a daisy chain to the can adapter that is connected to the SPI of the Raspberry Pi. On the PI we have an rt kernel that gets data from the joints at 250Hz it then sends that data over UDP to to the other arm that has the same setup. Data is then processed a bit and the formulas that are described below perform all the magic. The latency between 2 arms is around 4ms on the local network. In the future, we will test the same setup to work over the internet on long distances. From the testing on the local network, we noticed that you can get RTT/ping of 20ms and still have good performance.  
  
We are using these formulas, we got them from Ben Katz's paper, the creator of the mini cheetah quad.

"You have to use the Tesla approach:

The first model will be a $100k unit that will appeal to the rich, and give you enough press coverage to attract enough investors so you can build a cheaper model for the mass market.

It has to have enough real features so it replaces a human servant or three. Clean dishes, take stuff from the dishwasher to the cabinet, do the laundry, fold clothes, clean the house, do yardwork, walk the dog etc. Guard the house at night or when you are not home. All the mundane stuff that is easy for people, but takes time. And is currently very hard for robots.

A great benefit of a robot is that it can work 24/7, which is 168 hour work weeks instead of 40. (It should be able to swap its own batteries with the other set that is sitting on the charger. )

For anyone who has a big enough household so they actually use hired help, a functional robot will be cost effective quite quickly.

It is far simpler to make a machine that can load the desired cup onto a turret, and deposit the exact amount of whatever liquids or solids have been loaded into the machine from the suppliers.

But it's even easier to hire people to make coffee, and people tend to prefer human to human interactions, rather than poking pictures on a touch screen and having a coffee whizz out.

"Counter: why not just grind beans, boil water, and make your own coffee at home? Or why not just get a Keurig? It's hard to get much more efficient than pressing a button on a Keurig. It's cheaper too.

Answer: because human interaction is actually large part of what you are purchasing when you visit a cafe. It's what many of these brands are built on. As a barista I'm encouraged to learn people's names and ""get to know them."" Really, unless I'm making something very elaborate, I'm paid to stand in front of, really, a fancier and more expensive Keurig, or a blender, or shake things together with ice. I also clean, because it's a restaurant and bugs are nasty.

"hey, I think the best way to approach this is NOT TO BUY A KIT! 

why? A kit comes off as expensive and there might be so many components included in the kit which you might not end up using them at all. It can also create confusion especially for total beginners, I can't imagine staring at relay modules, transistors, IR sensors, diodes and a bunch of motors all bundled up in one box while I haven't even lit up an LED, this can quickly overwhelm someone. 

You want to choose a project e.g a line following robot controlled with an ESP32 and a bunch of sensors, then note down the components required as you watch over a tutorial, then order those components as a bunch. You'd save money, and also the kids(age 14+) would develop an engineer's way of thinking, project-based, modular, saving up on costs and only going for what's necessary - it also makes it simpler to learn robotics imo. I have mentored highschool kids in a robotics competition and it was so hard for them to do anything because they were all staring at these ""starter kits"" with all sorts of components. They were very basic components but the theory behind even an I2C LCD module can get you scratching your head.",r/robotics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnazBrX0NsRXV5REZuX2MtVV9BRWk2cjE3eWlYQ0hzV3Q5Wm5waHhnOXpuTDk0d1AxM0w3SVNodHZOUkNVQnZ3bmVVYWFfTF93aFh5YjV1d3pZYm55Znc9PQ==

"I know there's no solid definition of what a robot is, but I've always liked to think of it as an automaton that can react to external sensory data.

In this case, I think it's just picking stuff up from a programmed position and doing some programmed moves. Not a robot.

However, put a camera or some sensors into the mix, and it could be a robot. If it could detect that the milk level is low, it could do a ""steam milk"" subroutine.
