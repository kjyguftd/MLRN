"US don't actually need to put nuclear missiles around RUssia and China - all they need anti-nuclear system. 
Because nuclear missile after launch spreads its warheads on some stage. So to counter-attack, its counterparty need either 1 ether 12 (for example) AAA rockets. Since they never launched alone on WW3, so there is big difference between 10 nuke rockets or 120 warheads. Anything of it needs 1 AAA rocket. 
So before this peace keeped by parity. But now when Russia and China are surrounded by us military bases, parity fails.

"Regional intelligence operatives have intercepted a huge amount of Russian soldiers in Ukraine‚Äôs calls to their families back home. The Russian dudes there want out and there was/is no morale or resolve to fight among them. These men are pawns in the game- part of a long history of male expendability in great power military competitive games. They were lied to about what they were even doing (they were told the build up on the border was a training exercise, and got tricked into doing war crimes against people they would otherwise view as ethnic/cultural kin). I think a good regional strategy is to help the Russian soldiers surrender, and the biggest hurdle to that is that they will face the real threat that their families and loved ones in Russia will be persecuted for their actions. Either way, this is much more viable to induce de-escalation than any sanctions the US or western allies could impose on Russia and Russian oligarchs. Even sans troops (which he is certainly running out of), Putin is likely to just switch to an air-dominant campaign (as we are already slowly seeing) to continue the offensive.
