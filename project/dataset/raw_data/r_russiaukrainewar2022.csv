Therefore he revels in the opposites. He wastes his people's lives like they mean less than nothing to him. He pushes propaganda designed to convince people that the truth cannot be known, and has done this to his own people for a long time, creating a post-truth political climate.

"main thing is that he does not need to convince his people that his opponents are monsters, Russians are not a political nation, Russians can kill Russians, Ukrainians, Poles - it makes no difference and hey will ALWAYS be anti-Western. There are two types of slaves: 1) slaves who fight for freedom, receive human rights and, as a society, build their country. 2) Slaves who could not get freedom and rights, what changes their logic of action, is first envy of the more successful (they also want to live well, all the stories about spirituality are nonsense) which develops into hatred and the desire to destroy (read about ressentiment and ‚Äúmorality of slaves¬ª if you want to understand what motivates them).
That is why they always choose to destroy other countries instead of taking care of their own country.

when they deliberately show their war crimes, this is part of the war with the civilian population of Ukraine for demoralization, like a missile strike on children before the NATO summit, he says ‚Äúlook, all these values ‚Äã‚Äãare lies, no one will help you and I won‚Äôt get anything for it and I will continue to kill¬ª

"I have no doubt the West retaliates. But I think it‚Äôs just that - retaliation. US Intelligence got caught with their pants down in 2016 with Russian disinformation campaigns that had been ongoing for years and was part of a larger - and so far successful - strategy to destabilize the U.S. and its western allies. 

Russia has a head start and seemingly have the edge in disinformation because they‚Äôre using our values against us. They know the government can‚Äôt legally silence free speech, so their bot and troll armies flood social media in order to spread propaganda almost entirely unfettered. On the flip side, Russia tightly controls and severely punishes dissidence, so any Western-led propaganda campaigns really can‚Äôt take hold and spread organically like they can in the West.

Putin knows he can't win on the battlefield.
