"This is amazing. 

Highlights:

  
- But Blackstone's principal claim — that sounder investments have led to higher returns — is difficult to square with the ongoing decline of commercial real estate. It's hard to fathom how BREIT could have bought so many properties at the height of the market and yet somehow been selective enough to have dodged all the post-pandemic downturns suffered by other funds. According to BREIT's own numbers, data centers and student housing make up only a small part of its portfolio. And many of the data centers Blackstone says have already created so much value for the fund aren't even up and running yet — they're still in development.

  
- The alarm bells over BREIT go beyond whether Blackstone is overstating the fund's value. BREIT has said that through June of last year, 100% of its dividends were funded by cash flows from operations — the money produced by its real-estate assets. But that claim is more than a little misleading. In the measure of cash that BREIT highlights, it doesn't subtract the expenditures required to maintain its properties, which is standard for the industry. In its own fine print, in fact, BREIT does provide several other measures that are more analogous to how most REITS define cash flow; by those measures, the fund has never been able to cover its dividend from its cash flow.

  
- The future of BREIT could also send shock waves through Blackstone's bottom line. In 2022 alone, SLCG calculated, fees from BREIT generated 13.3% of Blackstone's total management fees and 12.6% of its performance revenue. If BREIT and its sister fund, BPP, are forced to slash their NAVs by 50%, the ensuing reduction in fees would wipe out over 15% of Blackstone's fee-related earnings — earnings that Wall Street, in contrast, is expecting will grow by 15%. According to Blackstone's financial statements, it's already anticipating it will have to pay the University of California $564 million in BREIT stock — an expense it doesn't count in the numbers it highlights to Wall Street. If BREIT craters, it will also be difficult for Blackstone to live up to Wall Street's expectations for its long-term earnings growth, which depend in part on its successful expansion into the retail market.",r/securityanalysis,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTUkhiYnZBMFpDMS13VG5rVkxzZjMzYTZ5MUZrTDBFTG9JbW5IUGgxUks5TXRNWkpQclh6TG5USFVDaUs5ODNKdFU5S0JRZl9mOEF3QUdXOU1Zd1RBbllXcldNRmZmQUN3TndvRlVLcXdDWGM9

"I used [https://youtubebuddy.streamlit.app/](https://youtubebuddy.streamlit.app/) to summarize the video:

In the video, the speaker, Lyn Alden, discusses the complexities of the global financial system, the history of money and banking, and the reasons why they are considered broken. Here is a summary of the key points mentioned in the video:

1. **Global Currencies and Inflation**: There are over 160 currencies in the world, and the money supply for most of them increases rapidly, which dilutes people's savings and wages. This dilution often benefits corporate interests, bankers, or corrupt officials at the expense of the public.
2. **Central Banks and Inflation Mandates**: Central banks have mandates to ensure prices continually increase, which goes against the natural deflationary effect of improving technology.
3. **Political Polarization**: In wealthy countries, money concentrates in fewer hands over time, and government debt increases, leading to political polarization.
4. **History of Money**: The video explains the evolution of money from barter systems to commodity money like gold and silver, and eventually to paper-based credit systems.
5. **Banking and Credit**: The concept of banking arose from the need to facilitate transactions over long distances and among larger groups of people. This led to the development of paper-based credit systems and eventually to fractional reserve banking.
6. **Fractional Reserve Banking**: This system allows banks to lend out more money than they have in reserves, which can lead to banking crises during times of mass withdrawals.
7. **Central Banks**: Central banks were created to support governments during crises and to mitigate the impact of fractional reserve banking crises.
8. **Gold Standard and Bretton Woods**: The video discusses the international gold standard, the Bretton Woods system, and the eventual move to unbacked fiat currencies.
9. **Petrodollar System**: After the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, the petrodollar system was established, which required oil to be sold in U.S. dollars, further entrenching the dollar's role in global trade.
10. **Currency Failures**: Many countries have experienced hyperinflation or high inflation rates, which erode the value of savings and wages.
11. **Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)**: Governments are exploring CBDCs, which are digitally native and centralized versions of fiat currencies.
12. **Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies**: The video discusses the emergence of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as decentralized digital currencies that offer an alternative to inflationary centralized banking ledgers.
13. **The Future of Money**: The speaker suggests that the future of money could go in two directions: further centralization with CBDCs or a more decentralized, open, and transparent system with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
14. **Call to Action**: Lyn Alden encourages viewers to share the video, read her book ""Broken Money: Why Our Financial System Is Failing Us and How We Can Make It Better,"" and consider the potential of decentralized, open-source money to improve the financial system.

The video aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how money and banking work, the historical context of the current financial system, and the potential for cryptocurrencies to offer a solution to the problems of centralization and inflation.

I had a similar reaction. I read her book ""Broken Money"", and struggled once she suggested that Gold was somehow ""slower"" than bitcoin because it's not a ledger system like bitcoin.

"By the mid-1980s, the whisper that “Boesky is buying” could move markets and provide the lubrication that corporate raiders and others needed to pull off a deal. Never a raider or a banker himself, Boesky became a sought after ally of financiers like Michael Milken who were eager to keep the deals flowing, even as the mergers became more misguided and the bonds sold to finance them became junkier.



In November 1986, Boesky pleaded guilty to conspiracy, unravelling not only his own myth building, but also the careers of Milken, against whom Boesky provided evidence, and others. Milken’s investment bank, Drexel Burnham Lambert, collapsed soon after.



In the wake of the Boesky trading scandal, Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission passed new rules that defined insider trading for the first time, leading to an era of increased enforcement and providing a road map for future investigations into Wall Street malfeasance.",r/securityanalysis,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUTVhPNGpmQnJMMWJrWE1DMUNwQWFlR3R5aFdtQVpvU3BSSG9FOHVHODBRQWZDNGMzTjlNZTdoZlBhcTJnc3ctaXl0TzZVdmhQWG5aYmVIUkwtbXBYRThMZ21NMHE1QjJtZmxJN0pXNWpraTg9

"Fundsmith is a great example of a marketable, scalable, open ended strategy. However, like all many open ended strategies there is an inherent liquidity bias. In a post-Woodford world this has to be at the forefront of every large, retail, open ended managers mind of course. Smithson, although an unfairly timed comparison given the lag of the small/mid cap sectors vs. large cap, offers a look at the strategy without the liquidity bias ( [currently trading at an ~10% discount to NAV](https://i.ibb.co/gjdwMgr/smithsonvfundsmith.png) ).. or at least that is how it is marketed. Fundsmith has [managed to grow AUM despite outflows](https://www.trustnet.com/news/13411490/investors-sell-fundsmith-and-baillie-gifford-funds-in-the-first-quarter-of-2024), which shows that liquidity is not an issue at least.


The key man risk with Fundsmith is very high vs. Berkshire and its not just because the fund takes his name...  but his more colourful behaviors - those mentioned in the article as though they are charming antics, are actually the most significant risk for investors.


One thing I would be curious about is the performance of a portfolio which follows Fundsmith's process. It would arguably hold a lot more Japan vs. Fundsmith which would have likely helped performance this year. Would it be better to just buy the top 100 stocks that return as an output of a pretty simple screen (obviously the future assumptions are the tricky part of any screen) than pay 90bps for Fundsmith to, as they put it, ""do nothing""?

"Thanks for posting, this was an interesting read. I'm broadly sympathetic to the idea that Live Nation may be enjoying certain monopolistic advantages, but there were a few points in your piece that I wanted to push on a little bit. Would love to have a discussion with you on these points, if you are interested and have the time.

1. The compensation package the CEO received in 2022 actually covers the next five years. Obviously he received the cash component in 2022, but the stock awards vest over the next 5 years based on performance. Look, he's obviously extremely well compensated on a cash basis alone, but it's misleading to say something like 19% of the firms operating income goes to the CEO, because that's just one years operating income against 5 years of compensation. 

2. On the discrepancy between the AOI they message to investors and the profit margin they focus on with regulators, the main difference is ticketing contract advances and D&A expense. These are real expenses that should be considered in their discussions with regulators. I can see why this feels like they are talking out of both sides of their mouth, but fundamentally it's because the two audiences are interested in different things. However, if anything I feel AOI is the more misleading number as I definitely see how games can be played with the ticketing contract advances to inflate AOI - however, this is not an issue with profit margin.

3. Evaluating the impact of FASB pronouncements and disclosing such evaluation is just business as usual and not necessarily a red flag. It's good to take a fine toothed comb through the disclosures, and there could be something here, but at the end of the day this is circumstantial and could easily be nothing.

4. Profit margins are substantially higher internationally because Live Nation's low margin concert/venue business is negligible internationally. Here I will just quote you: ""In the U.S., Live Nation has a giant capital intensive unprofitable division of putting on concerts."" In my view, confusion around reported numbers is not enough to allege ""shady accounting"" or fraud as we should have a very high bar for these allegations. 

5. EU/US price discrepancies are observed across product categories, with the common denominator really being the large and growing wealth disparity between the two. For example, the average vehicle price in the US is something like $45k, but only $30k in Europe.

• Salesforce is a pioneering force in the CRM and cloud computing industries, offering a comprehensive suite of products to enhance customer relationships, drive business growth, and improve operational efficiency.

• The company has grown to become one of the most influential in the technology sector, revolutionizing the software industry with its innovative SaaS approach.

• Salesforce operates on a unique subscription-based revenue model which has contributed to consistent revenue growth and financial stability. Its vast global customer base exceeds 150,000 with a revenue CAGR of 23% since 2016.

• According to IDC, Salesforce holds a commanding 22.1% share of the $65B CRM market as of 2023, far ahead of Microsoft at 5.7%. The CRM market is projected to grow at a 14% CAGR through 2030 driven by trends like hyper-personalization, AI/automation, and robust social media customer service.

• Some risks to monitor include significant insider selling by executives like CEO Marc Benioff over the past year, totaling a net $7M across 439 sell transactions vs only 6 buys. However, Benioff remains the largest individual shareholder with 4.3% ownership.

• The article presents both bull and bear perspectives on Salesforce without making an explicit recommendation.

"Corporate structure question:

If company A is the sole managing member of company B, despite A has only a minority (<50%) membership interests in B, is A still considered having the controlling interest of B?

"Here’s the BREIT Story in a nutshell: They’ve reported an annual return since inception for its Class S investors north of 10% with real estate investments that have a gross current rate of return of less than 5% on their cost.  They’ve been buying assets at a 4% cap rate, paying a 4.5% dividend and reporting 10+% returns. And nobody has called bullshit.



Attracted by marquee name sponsorship, high distribution rates and the promise of non-correlated returns, investors poured large sums of capital in. At its peak, BREIT was raising more than $3 billion in new equity a month and approximately half of BREIT’s investors elect to reinvest their shares, which reduces the amount of cash that must be distributed.



Blackstone is very clear in their marketing materials that distributions are primarily paid through subscriptions, borrowings and asset sales - and not necessarily from recurring cash flow which is typical for listed REITs.



If you’re an investor, you’d like to think you’re buying new real estate, not subsidizing fellow investors who want their cash. But that’s exactly what you’re doing. Newly sold shares, together with reinvested dividends, is cashing out investors who have elected to redeem their shares at NAV and receive their declared distributions in cash.

  
NAV is Inflated Because They’re Using Unrealistically Low Cap Rates



By taking BREIT’s current NOI and dividing it by the NAV, investors can compute the implied cap rate on BREIT’s portfolio as they are valuing it – and compare it with public REITs. Interest rates have moved 200-300 basis points in recent months, and in public markets elevated cap rates have driven a 25% decline in values. A recent analysis of two vehicles in the non-traded REIT space concluded that both funds are being valued at implied cap rates of approximately 4.0% when publicly traded REITs with a similar property sector and geographic are trading at an implied cap rate closer to 5.75% . **Applying that 5.75% cap rate to BREIT would result in a reduction in shareholder NAV of more than 50%. The current valuation of roughly $14.68/ share should be closer to $7-8/share.**",r/securityanalysis,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFV3RZV2hwV3lvTUstR0hIN1VHQ3hnUmxyYVBTTGtpaTQtOWV4MFhaOHpURGlZX3J2Qzd2NzhDblU4Q2VLdUVMX0QybVdFOWFKNG5jYWVzMEtWSGJaNHN6cnNFamU2R21ORk5yUTE4bnlVbVU9

"The flow of capital needed to make Nvidia’s valuation work boggles my mind. 

Analyst consensus puts 2026 revenue at ~$185B, which will be about $165B in data center cards. Just the cards. Total US oil and gas capex is ~$120B annually.  At the current rate, Google and Microsoft each may soon have higher capex than the entire US oil industry. 

And that only gets Nvidia to 30x earnings at ~65% operating margin in 2026.  Which plays into the temporary surplus multiple idea. If you assume margin compression with similar earnings/cash flow multiples, the numbers get even more staggering.",r/securityanalysis,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNONVJpNFNrQTJ0M0Y4QWowYUpmdEJScFBIR3RxREpOR2psTjRZb2lNNDBFSkV4ZjZWVFprajlDWE40T09iSmxvZ0JEQzF3bDg2NlpmT0pMVVBmZ0dNMlE9PQ==

"Yes, thinking about it in terms of economic interests and voting interests is the right approach. The voting interest is what will determine who holds the controlling interest.

Paramount Global is another great example. Shari Redstone controls something like 77% of the voting interests in PARA through her control of NAI, her holding company. Yet she only owns something like 10% of the economic interests of PARA. Despite her low % of economic interests, she is the controlling shareholder given the disproportionate amount of voting shares she holds.

That brings up a second point – often when you see these differences between party A holding most of the economic interests but party B holds most of the controlling interests, there are two different classes of stock that accomplish this. One class often only entitles a holder to a single vote, or no vote at all. While the other class is considered a supervoting class. That’s the case for PARA. It’s also true for LVMH.

To your example, I haven’t read the proxy or further detail on the A and B stock, but that appears to be the case here. So while the public float holds 100% of the A stock, the reason they are not controlling shareholders is because the B, which is majority held by the Founder, are very likely supervoting shares.

**Stepping back, in terms of control, in your example, it’s clear that control folds up to Mr. Peterffy.** He controls IBG LLC through his control of IBG Inc, which he controls through IBG Holdings LLC.

**In terms of economics, the economics also mostly go to Mr. Peterffy** (through his 75% membership interest in IBG LLC, which is where all of the OpCo assets are held – and thus where the cash is generated and distributed from.)

So sure, the public float has 100% of the economic interest in IBG Inc., but that only equates to 25% of the economic interest in the actual OpCo businesses / cash flow. 75% goes to Peterffy, who also controls the entire structure.

On your last point: *“if say company C holds the majority membership interests in B, it'd mean C has the majority voting interest in B, does that not make C having the controlling interest of B even though A is the sole managing member of B?”*

Not necessarily – just because C holds the majority of membership interests in \\[company\\] B does not mean that C has the controlling interest. These membership units could be purely economics with no voting power, which is what the footnote implies, although I haven’t dug into any other filings.

The footnote reads as though IBG Inc holds all of the control of IBG LLC, but remember the control of IBG Inc is held by Mr. Peterffy. **So whether the control of IBG LLC is held by IBG Inc or IBG Holdings LLC is almost irrelevant… because it all boils up to Mr. Peterffy holding control.** 

Hope this helps!",r/securityanalysis,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQR3BGWWhTbHFGVnhHSWstWW1lYXZ6dTIxNTBTdEZGTE5nV3JZVTdoczNjN21BNWVXN2JQVzNzWWxhZU1GbzBsT2duTldBZHlvaVdpOHpyS2VueUpweHc9PQ==

"In 18 months we start seeing orders coming in or at least some yield improvement on guys coming out. 

The market will have to price INTC like a true profitable IFS, which alone I think is worth $100 billion.

So - it's obviously not worth as much as TSMC, but  a sum of the parts valuation, like, the fact that you have this stable leading edge fab in the US, like, that's got to be worth 100 billion.

"Thanks for the explanation! On this point of yours:

>Not necessarily – just because C holds the majority of membership interests in \\[company\\] B does not mean that C has the controlling interest. These membership units could be purely economics with no voting power, which is what the footnote implies, although I haven’t dug into any other filings.

Are you suggesting membership interests can be either economic or voting interests, or both? You seem to suggest the 75% membership interests Peterffy has in IBG LLC are purely economic. My understanding was membership interests necessarily include both economic *and* voting interests.

The other clarification I'm seeking is the definition and impact of ""sole managing member"" on control/voting. Based on the IBKR example here, it seems that sole managing member implies control but not necessarily the main beneficiary of economic interests.",r/securityanalysis,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXbWdNN05DN1ZoS0pNVWc2aF80ZE40THZpdEFFT1I5YkNKZVRlTWxkcHhsUWtiVXN3R1V4anlJbVl4aDljTnUxU0FGVzVuUFRJcVV2MWkyWXdETEpqX0E9PQ==
