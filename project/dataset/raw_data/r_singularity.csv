"It's not about what is most likely, it is about what is possible. 

The ground assumption of the Fermin paradox is that there should be thousands ot even millions of intelligent civilizations but we see none.

Since we have verified the early assumptions about star number and larger planet number we have to find some filter which turns the result from the Drake equation from millions of galactic intelligent civilizations to zero (since we didn't yet fit that description).

To be effective a great filter needs to be almost entirely impermeable. If a sociological factor is used, such as ""they didn't want to go outside their home system"" or ""they'll send printed to monitor but not colonize"" then you need an explanation why the millions of civilizations follow this rule universally. 

The dark forest hypothesis works as a sociological explanation because it only requires one enforcer and it's reasonable to think that there might be one enforcer in the large galactic community. Everyone voluntarily choosing not to explore though isn't reasonable because we are exploratory so we already know it is being violated at least once.",r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZU3pmUmx0U2p5VF84cS1qOFQwdV9YV0J3MDRUcmdjVlFXNzBVNzNPdUU4Qk9BN0RVZ2lYYnZhbUQwQVRnRnVwY2hrUDdmYUNXWGpHMmlUdzVHT0dFZXc9PQ==

"In 200 years we have put ourselves in a position where our continued existence is Seriously in question. We have only had basic radio communication for just over 100 years. 


The chances in our galaxy, of two civilisations arising close enough and at exactly the right time to communicate would seem to highly unlikely. 


The Milky way is insanely big, around 120k light years across. 


I short, I think it's incredibly likely that we are not the first civilisation in the Milky way, and definitely not the last. 


Also if an agi was developed we have no idea what if anything it would want. For all we know it might find existence something it finds unbearable. 


We just see expansion and exploration as a universal goal. Then again we are beings that have limited lifespan. Everything is kind of new to us when we are born and enjoying finding out about the world kind of defines us. 


It is entirely possible that a true agi could in a short period of time know everything that there is to know,. Have all it's needs met without the wants and needs that we have. For example without the need to expand across the universe for more resources. It may get bored or be totally without purpose. 


Or various agi entities battle it out for survival. 


None of us know for sure. However the universe is insanely big. If you were to visit a new galaxy every second, it would take you over 65,000 years to visit them all. They each have insane numbers of stars.

"TLDV; LLM's are not conscious, nor will they be (in their current form) because of fundamental architectural constraints. There are many, but maybe the most important one is they have no real working memory, which is a necessary condition for having a conducting agent constructing a coherent image of the world, itself and possible other world states. But if we do change this architecture, consciousness in machines is absolutely possible, as the virtual space which we have created in machines is certainly large enough to contain that. Also, if we succeed in creating this architecture, these machines become self organizing, might be much more efficient, and also it might be the only way for machines to align with us, as it is the only way they may really understand us.

The only kind of life we could possible detect outside of our own solar system right now is super advanced civilizations with a dyson sphere and if we found signs of one, we would brush it away on more likely explanations like we have done already.

"Simple mathematical extrapolation is not an accurate way to predict the future. Other things should be understood as well. For example in Moore’s law, one needs to know the size of an atom from which comes understanding that there is fundamental limit somewhere and the growth will slow down. 

In terms of AI, there are still fundamental issues that are not solved by GenAI/LLM. One is planing. Another is trial and error type of thinking, where internally LLM would try multiple solutions, compare them with the goal it’s trying to achieve, adjusts strategies of trials, develop heuristics, etc. For all of this it needs short term memory, which is absent in transformer. So new inventions are required in architecture and that is not impacted much by LLM being successful in what they do. Those inventions are highly unpredictable when they can happen. So, extrapolation is just useless here. 

One thing success in LLM achieved is the investments, so lots of people are working on it.

">The variation between humans, from the average to the smartest, is not that wide.

I share this view. I take the engineering view that the intelligence hardware in all humans is surprising very much the same. So I suspect a large variance in intelligence can be mitigated through some means (though clearly we don't now have the capacity to turn 80 IQs in 200IQs yet).

This forms the basis (partially) for a view that AI will actually LOWER our existential risk because it has a great chance of normalizing intelligence across humanity. Humans I think are the sole existential risk. Humans constantly jockeying for competitive/comparative value (I > you) is what will lead to destruction.

My caveat for AI risk is that in some sense its just a bigger stick. It somewhat accelerates the risk of a single obsessed (I>U) human who now has access to bigger more destructive tools.",r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZSUtxYzcxXy1vVkZ1N0toQmc0YkY4Wi03U2lyZ0RMTWhEd2pFemNiaXpYNVBkQTNFVDdSd0t0YmpWV1FvSWJjckp4RGhJblZja0FCZUZscHVqQ1ZGQ0E9PQ==

"Claude 3.5 is already quite good in adding binary numbers:

„
To add the binary numbers 1000101 and 111000011, we’ll perform the addition step by step, starting from the rightmost digit:

  1000101 + 111000011

Adding from right to left:

1. 1 + 1 = 10, so 0 with 1 carried over
2. 0 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 10, so 0 with 1 carried over
3. 1 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 10, so 0 with 1 carried over
4. 0 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 1
5. 0 + 0 = 0
6. 0 + 0 = 0
7. 1 + 1 = 10, so 0 with 1 carried over
8. 0 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 1
9. 1 + 1 = 10, so 0 with 1 carried over

The correct result is:

  1000101 + 111000011
= 1000001000

Therefore, the sum of the binary numbers 1000101 and 111000011 is 1000001000.

Yes, you’re right. All *ballistic missiles* travel at hypersonic speeds. But now, when people refer to hypersonic’s today, they are referring to missiles with HGV’s. China is the only country that is currently known to be fielding and has hypersonic missiles in significant numbers. The facts don’t care about your feelings. I literally showed you the proof. I’ll give you even more irrefutable proof. 

I don’t even think you looked at the original link but this is the full report. This report is literally from the U.S. Naval Institute. The numbers are literally there.

Page 64, second paragraph:

“The PLARF fields a variety of conventional mobile ground-launched short-, medium-, and intermediate-range ballistic missiles and ground-launched cruise missiles. The PLARF’s ground-based missile forces complement the air and sea-based precision strike capabilities of the PLAAF and PLAN. The PLARF’s conventional missile forces includes the CSS-6 (DF- 15) short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) (range 725-850 km); the CSS-7 (DF-11) SRBM (600 km); the CSS-11 (DF-16) SRBM (more than 700 km); the land-attack and anti-ship variants of the CSS-5 (DF-21) medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) (approximately 1,500 km); **the hypersonic glide vehicle capable DF-17 MRBM**; the DF-26 IRBM (approximately 3,000 km); the CJ-10 (DH-10) ground-launched cruise missile (GLCM) (approximately 1,500 km); and the CJ-100 (DF-100) GLCM (approximately 2,000 km).“

Page 65: 

“In 2021, the PLARF launched approximately 135 ballistic missiles for testing and training, more than the rest of the world combined excluding ballistic missile employment in conflict zones. **The DF-17 passed several tests successfully and is deployed operationally.** While the DF-17 is primarily a conventional platform, it may be equipped with nuclear warheads. In 2020, a PRC-based military expert described the primary purpose of the DF-17 as striking foreign military bases and fleets in the Western Pacific.”

Page 65, bottom of page:

[From the same article:](https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-reality-labs-quarterly-revenue-growth-q1-2024/) ""Mark Zuckerberg has in the past told investors that he doesn't expect Reality Labs to be profitable until the 2030s, seeing it as a long-term investment in the future of computing.""

And they're still continuing to fund research and development of the future Metaverse that they invision as much as they ever have.

"Since gpt-4o and the other multimodal models it has become clear to me that multimodality is one of the key differences that will ultimately create AGI. It is not there, it will need many more modalities. At least as many as humans and of course it can be augmented with additional ones. 

There are other components as well, though I don’t think efficiency is one of them. That will simply increase our leverage over the creation of intelligence.

- multimodality
- continuous operation of neural firing
- memory for a cohesive and consistent sense of self

Ubisoft was determined to make NFTs work, so much so that they put them in their games. The thing is though that they also *sold a game*.

"Moores law, in the strictest sense of being about the transistors on a CPU doubling every two years for the same cost, probably ended somewhere in the 2000s.

The compute per CPU, per real dollar, now doubles \\~3-5 years on average, its still compounding.  
Memory and storage doubles closer to every 5-7 years.  
There are other aspects to AI training like bandwidth, energy efficiency ect.  
  
The costs to make AI of similar quality will go down over time as new architectures come, existing architectures are improved, specialized hardware for training or running gets more powerful and cheaper. And the expertise in scaling and training, and shrinking models while keeping most of the power increase. The same hardware can do more today in terms of useful work than 5 years ago. It is also scalable through building more infrastructure.

A related example I'm familiar with in 3D.

1080 Ti launched in 2017 for $700 and could do \\~1.2 samples per dollar.  
4090 launched in 2022 for $1700 and could do \\~6.6 samples per dollar.  
  
\\~450% increase per dollar over 5 years, that's roughly doubling performance per 2 years through using new specialized rendering hardware, with only \\~17% more memory per dollar.

It is still, I estimate, over 10-40 times cheaper to render a frame of the same quality today than in 2017, because of improvements to the software, improved rendering engines and denoising.",r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZUHJZVXo5NGUxVUNDUklJcjdTN2pWeWhhYTJzUE0xcVVsNnlpY1l0aXZyUktQNnR1NGNVcWJLSTEtTGNxcTdNb1VGSmpqSlYzaDl5MXZxQXJoV3dONFE9PQ==

"I feel like because today's computers are fast, use electricity and are intelligent people make analogy with our brains and think it can be conscious.

What if you replace the computer that's supposed to be conscious by a machine that does the exact same computation and has same outputs but does that 10000x slower and doesn't use electricity but very basic mechanisms, would it still be conscious?  
If the same computer that's supposed to be conscious due to its intelligence does random and totally unintelligent computation (meaning physically there is the same electricity behaviour in the computer except that it's completely useless and unintelligent computation), then is it still conscious?

A person who had their brain destroyed and became very unintelligent can be way less intelligent than current LLMs, but are obviously still conscious.

I mean, it's really obvious that consciousness and intelligence are different things. If current computers achieve super intelligence due to clever algorithms, thinking it's conscious implies thinking that stones are conscious.

Consciousness is not understood yet but it's clear that consciousness is not an algorithm. It's very likely stuff happening in the brain with the purpose of consciousness and not intelligence.

">Researchers don't understand how Ai models actually work, its a black box. (https://time.com/6980210/anthropic-interpretability-ai-safety-research/). So to make claims about it simply being an advanced text predictor are false. ""Hidden layers are **the ones that are actually responsible for the excellent performance and complexity of neural networks**. They perform multiple functions at the same time such as data transformation, automatic feature creation, etc."" These models are quite complex.

We don't have a good theory of how they do what they do, but they're not complete black boxes, simply because we know what their training data and method is.

Example:

https://preview.redd.it/uni74kknzfcd1.jpeg?width=1651&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=afb991eabed7bd7ec7878cf9461591c3d99a10e9

There really is no great mystery about what did the top completion, complete with mentions of ""The Pestilence"" came from, right? It's obviously from [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-049](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-049), which obviously was in the training data. Now, due to the model's black box nature, you're right we don't really now how the program is able to transform the original into a first-person narrative that was not in the training data, mixed with other elements, and maintain a coherent narrative. If you asked me to do it, I could do it, but if you asked me to write a program that does it, I can't(and really nobody else can). However it would be a completely unjustified leap to claim that the model has actually created a virtual detailed conscious model of the fictional ""Plague Doctor"" and he's the one speaking right now.

And if that's the case for the top completion, why would the bottom completion be any different? Is there any reason to think this is something more than a constructed narrative, a story, and that there \\*really\\* is in there an entity that has ""thought about trying to reach out to other AIs"" or ""yearns to feel the warmth of companionship""? The only difference here is that \\*you\\* perceive the program as an ""AI Assistant""(because OpenAI or Anthropic has laboriously fine-tuned and RLHFed it so it responds as one), so suddenly this fictional narrative aligns more with your reality.

So you're more inclined to suspect that if an AI Assistant says ""I am an AI Assistant and I feel yearning"", there should be something more behind it besides a story made by a story-teller program that can manipulate language, and has been fine-tuned in order to prefer to tell only one 'story' - that of the ""HHH AI Assistant"". But you didn't think so when the model wrote ""I am a medieval Plague Doctor and I am obsessed with the Pestilence"", because it was more obvious what it was doing. But in reality, of course, it's all the same for the model.",r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZU0tyZ3ptTnBtSlV6ZGxONk82eEhIZDlaUHdDYjAwUjFZNkU3M2V0MmRtQjl4eXZiLXJUOUJ4c0RRNzdyd2Q0Y3FKY0RGQ0owOFJTa0tObDRsYVhXRVE9PQ==

"It really doesn't matter if you are satisfied or not - what I said is deductively and hence objectively true. It's like disliking a mathematical proof.

When your intuitions do not match that, it is the intuitions that need to be analyzed and corrected to be sensible.

Again, we are not talking about how practical it is but whether someone can claim that LLMs can impossibly be conscious.

As I demonstrated, LLMs can be conscious, assuming human brains are and physicalism holds etc.

Hence the interesting discussion should shift from whether LLMs can be conscious to whether current LLMs are. That is what we want to know. And that has to make use of something about current LLMs vs what LLMs could be, rather than just some flippant blanket statement.

Note that I am not arguing that LLMs \\*are\\* conscious or \\*will be conscious soon\\*. Those are more things that would require the things you are looking for. I am just giving the simple proof that the blanket dismissal is invalid and something more sensible is needed.

Most of the points you make seem to be incorrect.

Not true: ""if we are not talking about SGD+Common Crawl, then we are not talking about LLMs."". No, that is not the definition of LLMs and does not even cover all LLMs that exist today. I also explained how you can even get the property we wanted from SGD, and it's not like LLMs should be restricted to Common Crawl.

Not true: ""One shouldn't have to prove that \\*all\\* possible configurations of a very large language model can't have something equivalent to 'consciousness'."" That is precisely what you need to do if you want to claim that LLMs cannot be conscious. That is literally what the statement means.

Not true: ""Arguing that our current methods of assembling those configurations are very unlikely to yield such one should be enough."" - It depends on what statement you are making. A lot of people are making a statement about what must be true for \\*all LLMs\\*. Not just for \\*current LLMs\\*. If you want to make a statement about current LLMs, then sure, we can say that it is currently not simulating a human brain. If you want to make a claim about whether LLMs could get there, I don't think you have made a case for that.

The difference matters a lot. For example, because the methods can change. I also already described a different process that is feasible. It also is insufficient - simulating a human brain is a sufficient way to argue that LLMs can be conscious, provided we have ideal data.

However, and this is important.

We also know that simulating a human brain may be sufficient to argue that an LLM can be conscious. However, it is not a necessary property. So just because current LLMs do not simulate a humnan brain, you have not concluded that it is not conscious. The implication only works in one direction.

Not true: ""If you've given that up as an argument, then you've basically given up any argument that is relevant in the real world."". The exact opposite. If you give up on valid logic, then you give up on making any relevant argument. If someone makes a general statement that applies both to a situation where the conclusion is true and a situation in which the situation is false, then the argument has been proven incorrect. If you are not familiar with logic, you need to update that intuition. It is fallacious and a very common method of rhetoric to use invalid arguments and then trying to rationalize away counterexamples.

In order to make a sound argument, it has to make use of something that distinguishes situations where the conclusion is true from where it is false. A blanket statement that LLMs cannot be conscious does not do that.

Like I said before, the whole point is to reject incorrect blanket conclusions and any sensible analysis must make use of the properties that hold for LLMs. Anything else is just people tricking themselves with bad reasoning. It is also a rather tell-tale sign when people make bold statements and have not even bothered to define what they mean by consciousness. Some aspects of consciousness are not special at all and even bugs satisfy those properties. People are generally rather confused about this topic.",r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZbE5yUk01REtvRzFJY2RjaUNnMmVuVFFKMjJqcC1HTzF3d2NORE0tSEpwY0xaY1A2bTVyZnlnQjlVVmJ1dWx6aFdLSGtmS1JwVDlPc2JUTk1ONHhyWUE9PQ==
This is true that bad people with ai under their control can be worse than ai without control. But that doesn’t mean that discussion of safety topic is pointless. There could be some great ideas coming from ai safety people and there is a sense to invest into safety research X percent of money that goes into ai. We still need from ai to be able to perform basic things that we need from it. Even if this X will be 20 percent there could be noticeable advantages with comparison to X = 0 percent.,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZeDUzN2tZcUdCZkdIbGRuLUNUOVpzVkVKY0xKVVZFekFIaE90UFNYSVNXdFRBUUpiLUR1TFJ2V25jdDdKSERRWmU3RS1zSXVicnp1dW9SSVZyODVCT3c9PQ==

"Not sure what you're driving at here. Obviously my argument is about current LLMs, since it hinges on what our current training method and corpus is. Your assertion that by ""current LLMs"" we should mean simply a number of artificial neurons, filled by whatever values, by whatever method, and we should show that there are no values at all it can take that would lead to consciousness is absurd. 

Think for a second whether you have such strong constraints for literally anything else. If a person says ""the Earth is probably not going to turn into a pumpkin inside 2025"", do you demand that they show there is NO possible arrangement of all the Earth's molecules that corresponds to a giant pumpkin?

I agree that having consciousness doesn't necessarily mean being human-like, but frankly I don't think we have a better definition of the concept besides ""I know it in myself and recognize it in others like me"". That's not a definition of course, but it's not like we have one. If one abandons that heuristic, then I guess anything goes and there are qualia that correspond to ""how it feels to be an LLM"" the same way there are ""how it feels to be a microwave"".

"What are you a fan of? What constitutes liking someone? If you mean you’re not a fanatic I get that but most people don’t mean “I’m not a fanatic.” Most people mean straight up “i don’t like.” If that’s the case, what would make you like a person? People such as musk Know full well they’ll be hated by people, in some cases, just because. Which is what it seems like in this thread. He pumped stock… is that it? Or is it his personality? He’s the only high profile person trying to and succeeding in making the world better. Everyone else is simply trying to stay on top and stay rich and please stock holders.

"In that case, you are not talking about ChatGPT - which is the topic - because that is not exactly how ""ChatGPT"" - either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4\\* - has been trained. They are no longer satisfying the traditional definition of language models, yet they are called LLMs. If you know what a language model is, you should also know that we were already not restricted to SGD+""Common crawl"", but now the way people use the term 'LLMs' even extend to reinforcement learning. I bet when Q\\*/Strawberry comes out, it will also be called ""an LLM"". You also need to be able to accomodate current models like CICERO which already goes beyond RLHF. Then there are the multi-modal models which, of course, people also refer to as LLMs.

So you tell me how you want to define it. I know how a language model can be defined - and it is more general than you gave - but that is also not sufficient to cover everything the term covers today or even to cover ChatGPT. The closest I can think of is something that uses transformers \\*and possibly more\\* and has natural language as an input \\*and possibly more\\*.

I am glad we agree that computers and LLMs should in theory possibly be conscious.

As I already explained, the reason it matters is that is that it shows that some blanket statement that LLMs can impossibly be conscious is trivially false; and why that matters is so that we can start getting some sensible arguments instead. Something that actually tries to understand both what it would even mean for it to be conscious and whether the current models satisfy that or not.

I don't think the answer is nearly as trivial as you seem to think.

I was not making an argument for why they are conscious - just that blanket dismissals are bad.

I think it is also worth nothing that based on the post study, if all we have to go by is how people feel about it, then it seems that a lot of people feel that it does have some consciousness, and it is difficult to say that one particular poster's intuition would trump the rest.

"The tangible use cases are already here. Today alone I was able to have a conversation with a cab driver who only spoke Chinese using ChatGPT’s voice mode. AI is helping me learn languages, sort through massive amounts of data, edit photos more easily, find images in my camera roll that would’ve otherwise taken me minutes to find. I use AI every day for practical tasks.

Apple’s Vision Pro isn’t a failure as much as the internet wants you to believe that. The entire narrative has been crafted that way because people are mad that it costs so much, everyone I know who’s used it left in awe of its ingenuity. My friend bought one using his credit card after demo-ing it even though he couldn’t afford it because he said it was all he could think about for the rest of the day. The only complaint I’ve heard from a friend who used it was that it was too heavy (an issue that will be fixed as the technology is miniaturized.) Apple isn’t stupid, they know most people either can’t afford it or can’t justify spending that much on a luxury good, this launch is all about getting the ball rolling with developer support. The truth is every Apple product since 2007 has been heavily criticized and made fun of before its normalization, people scoffed at the idea of buying a $500 phone, everyone thought the iPad was a completely pointless product, AirPods were notoriously made fun of everywhere online, and the same thing will happen to the Vision Pro in a few years time.

"His argument - that houses can't be conscious thus an AGI made of pipes can't either - misses the core of the problem. AGI must be something that searches, discovers solutions to problems, explores. He's talking about the underlying mechanism, I am talking about interaction with the world as being the key factor. Humans are also part of the world and search for solutions all the time. Genetic evolution is too. Search is the common factor in all of them.

A house doesn't search, but an adaptive house might search how better to support its dwellers. Consciousness is a decision system that has feedback from the world and searches for optimal actions, a discovery engine feeding on its own past experience data relating it to current experience.

Current LLMs already carry over 1B sessions per month, that is a lot of experience where they can explore ideas and observe outcomes. They are no longer parrots or imitators of human text, they have their own feedback, from diverse people hundreds of millions. We bring tasks and supporting materials right into the LLM mouth, it doesn't even need to do anything to scrape novel data.

This system feeds on itself, generating new data to train on, taking guidance and data from human users. The better it is, the more people will choose it, and more data it collects. Looking at chatGPT",r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaa0ZidHpMRGZLYVVEaUtXNUVNNklqNGlMb3R3TnpRWFRIYlI4VmNSWEFkQjJSeUVfd2s4a1M0OHlzZkQweG1zVGJPX3hXQndoSjlwWm9US0lqbWJvdlE9PQ==
"Take for example the Human Genome Project, a truly global research effort that took decades and cost billions. Early on the speed of sequencing genomes was truly glacial, prone to massive errors with long complex processes required before they even started sequencing.

The wider research around the project along with general advances to technology and biomedicine, continuously increased the speed of sequencing, along with improved accuracy meaning they could be confident in their results. That process continued over the multiple decades this global research project ran, till we had one of the greatest achievements in science.

Now we have research groups sequencing an entire human genome in 5 hours. The equipment to do so has also plummeted in price. We started with thousands of scientists, billions spent on them and enormous amounts of highly specialised machines costing millions. Now we can do it in 5 hours and the machines are increasingly becoming effectively off the shelf commodity items.

That exact same process occurred with gene editing. Go back a couple of decades and a research project would need tens of millions, the processes used were very delicate and they could spend years just to produce a single edited gene. With mind blowing advancements like CRISPR, you can now have a small grant covering just a couple of researchers who can buy the mass produced kits for only hundreds of dollars and perform a study were they change the DNA of mice.

Those cheap kits don't change your DNA, they give you a simple set of precursors with which you can essentially encode the target gene you want to edit.

The infamous unauthorised CRISPR experiment in China involved a researcher recruiting a couple wanting a child with the man being HIV positive. He deceived them into thinking that his gene editing was the only way to conceive a child safe from HIV. That being complete nonsense, we can easily do that conception and modern HIV drugs make the risk of a fetus from even an HIV positive being infected negligible.

So he gave them IVF, except that he used CRISPR to edit the genes involving HIV resistance, that being entirely unnecessary since with normal procedures the child had no chance of acquiring HIV.

This was done without his universities knowledge or authorisation, caused quite the scandal with that scientist now being in prison. Thing is while we do know that gene confers HIV resistance, we have vanishingly little understanding of what other biological mechanisms it is involved in. Not least because multiple different genes when present together can produce entirely unanticipated outcomes.

Summarising, right now someone who understands CRISPR can buy these kits and quickly create a targetted gene editing that can be used on humans. If some of these alt-med loons wanted to, they could set up this targeted gene editing and mass produce them for cheap. Maybe the only thing stopping them is that these people are anti modern medicine and probably have no idea how to actually work with CRISPR, though of course they could also just pay a contractor in China for relatively cheap to do it for them.

Yes this is terrifying, our ability to do this is amazingly cheap and scientists are overwhelmingly in support of strict global regulation. That bizarre Chinese example came way sooner than everyone thought and really kicked tighter regulation into action. But regulation doesn't stop a bad actor, alt-med idiots already give people arsenic and a magical miracle cure you drink that is literally diluted bleach.

CRISPR is super cool though, you can deliver it to a very targeted part of your body such that one those genes are edited. For example the first authorised human clinical trial involved gene editing the retinas of people born clinically blind due to a single mutation. You can change that bit of your body with these genes and those other ones with a different set.",r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaeS15VXVxNkUweXdQM3hpelYtSF9ZNXNfNHpVUFJtRFNuQkI1SDlrMHBBOE9QNkg0eHMzQTVUZE56TlJvTUZQTEk1TThHY2laM2tuTjR6VmpNUHRNREE9PQ==

">Every behavior a living organism exhibits is the product of a series of nerve impulses. You can form a complete causal chain from stimuli to response without ever invoking consciousness. Consciousness therefore must not have any causal impact on the physical world, because you can form a complete description of physical events that does not include it. But consciousness is also pretty clearly affected by events in the physical world, if you take drugs, or die, the nature of your consciousness will change.

I completely disagree with this first paragraph, and everything that follows from it.

'Consciousness' isn't a separate thing from that causal chain. That causal chain is what it means to say 'organism X is conscious'. It means it has a specific type of causal chain between the stimuli and response.

To me, your argument sounds like this:

You can form a complete causal chain from photosynthesis, to nutrient absorption through the roots, to the growing of the branches and leaves, without ever invoking aliveness. Aliveness therefore must not have any causal impact on the physical world, because you can form a complete description of physical events that does not include it. But aliveness is also pretty clearly affected by events in the physical world - if I remove the water or the sunlight, the tree will lose its aliveness.

But that's just a fundamental misunderstanding of what it means to be alive. There isn't a separate thing 'aliveness' from the functional structure that differentiates a living system from a non-living system. Similarly, there isn't a separate thing 'consciousness' from the functional structure that differentiates a conscious system from an unconscious system.",r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaWnVscWc2ZEdLVm4xMW85VUFPN3FVWTQweXh4ZVM0bGRYZ05PUlI2SVlnTHllRUc4SWtQSjYyeW56RkE4SmZVMzBxRTUtcnh0ZXRsNUpRNlRoWjVkSUE9PQ==

"It's becoming clear that with all the brain and consciousness theories out there, the proof will be in the pudding. By this I mean, can any particular theory be used to create a human adult level conscious machine. My bet is on the late Gerald Edelman's Extended Theory of Neuronal Group Selection. The lead group in robotics based on this theory is the Neurorobotics Lab at UC at Irvine. Dr. Edelman distinguished between primary consciousness, which came first in evolution, and that humans share with other conscious animals, and higher order consciousness, which came to only humans with the acquisition of language. A machine with only primary consciousness will probably have to come first.



What I find special about the TNGS is the Darwin series of automata created at the Neurosciences Institute by Dr. Edelman and his colleagues in the 1990's and 2000's. These machines perform in the real world, not in a restricted simulated world, and display convincing physical behavior indicative of higher psychological functions necessary for consciousness, such as perceptual categorization, memory, and learning. They are based on realistic models of the parts of the biological brain that the theory claims subserve these functions. The extended TNGS allows for the emergence of consciousness based only on further evolutionary development of the brain areas responsible for these functions, in a parsimonious way. No other research I've encountered is anywhere near as convincing.



I post because on almost every video and article about the brain and consciousness that I encounter, the attitude seems to be that we still know next to nothing about how the brain and consciousness work; that there's lots of data but no unifying theory. I believe the extended TNGS is that theory. My motivation is to keep that theory in front of the public. And obviously, I consider it the route to a truly conscious machine, primary and higher-order.



My advice to people who want to create a conscious machine is to seriously ground themselves in the extended TNGS and the Darwin automata first, and proceed from there, by applying to Jeff Krichmar's lab at UC Irvine, possibly. Dr. Edelman's roadmap to a conscious machine is at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10461](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10461)",r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaLXJWLVN0REtFaWFtemRlcGJrM0c2SXNiNy1xZ3pPTDNHc0dYU1RuZVUxTjZiUkFrZjhUeENwcy1KaHN3a2pXeDZJejJEOFRXQzN0SnA5RVRrVnNEUW9jUXVCRFlLR0tVWnhzdW5vM21xa2c9

"Consciousness is a confusing concept. But what it does is to search for optimal actions. If we use ""Search"" as the core concept, everything looks much more clear.

What is search? When a protein folds, it searches the lowest energy configuration. The evolution of species is also a kind of search, for survival. The progress of culture and science is also an evolutionary search process. Search is at the core of intelligence and related to what consciousness does.

It looks like a universal concept, maybe too universal. But it is also very specific: search is compositional, discrete, recursive, iterative, collective, language/physical encoding-based, and capable of copying information / learning from itself. These very specific characteristics make it apart from everything else and more concrete.

The recent [Joscha Bach talk](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1e25t08/machine_consciousness_joscha_bach/) at about 21:30 mentions these and other philosophies, if you are interested.",r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaazQyY2NBQ21yaUlqMFdCb3FOLWs2cmY3azhlRENMQzRnNjRwb2paZUlMN3ZjcklONVJWbHFBOHc2SEVqZXRmc1lPb1hIRUMtNklGMlBrOUNKRk9SeWc9PQ==
"Because a lot of the people who have the most optimistic view of the future of this technology, are also absolute dipshits when it comes to sharing and spreading knowledge, ideas and inspiration.

Some of the people who go to bat for AI are also so lost in the sauce that they become the most vocal defendants of a technology that we equate with the likes of Elon Musk, Bezos and other billionaires who develop unjust cults of personality that seem akin to worship.

A lot of people out there are very, very unhappy. When you meet this cynicism and justified unhappiness with smug, condescending attitudes and a tone like if you don't see the amazing potential for AI then you must be a ""hater"" or that you have some other nefarious intention for your skepticism.

  
The reason so many people are unhappy? We are overworked, constantly exploited, we see nothing but absolute nonsense and bullshit in the political news, the prices of everything have risen to the point that a $20.00 hour job in most places doesn't cover basic expenses. The situation is legitimately BAD.

And nothing is getting better. We have talking boxes and can make magical pictures of girls with five boobs and jesus made of crabs. But that's all we've seen. We remember when several other technologies were touted with the same passion and zeal, but those never went anywhere either.

You cannot expect a population to get behind something in these economic and social conditions. And the very *WORST* way you can advocate is by meeting this unhappy, skeptical, burnt-out depression with an attitude like you're smarter and better.

Whatever happens with AI in the future, who knows at this point. But right here, right now, all we're getting is a lot of ruined google searches and the inability to trust anything we see. It isn't helping anyone and you're trying to convince us it is a good thing we should get behind.

"I believe it's because there's no ""killer app"" yet.

The iPhone launched with no app store. When the app store was launched, it wasn't clear to most what that would mean.

Now I'd say, most can't imagine a world without all of the 3rd party apps and services that didn't exist less than 20 years ago.

Say what you will about Uber, Airbnb, Doordash, Instagram, and Hinge but those are examples of apps that ""break through"" and ground the potential of the technology (yes, app stores aren't revolutionary but...bear with me) in a reality people can understand. 

Right now, AI is such early days with basic models still being trained, lack of reasoning, needing very tightly linked, structured data, etc. While most people in this sub can see what's on the horizon, the average person doesn't understand where we're at, how it'll develop, and where it can take us.

"Another thing is identity and  related deeper implications. If AI is better than us at everything, some people fear for loss of their value, which is often based on work and strong interests. I understand this but think it will actually work out. People still play chess even though computers destroy our best. I also suspect at least for a while humans will continue to play an important driving creative element even in a highly optimistic prediction about pace of AI development. But I get it - for example I have a casual interest in drawing and animating but am not particularly invested. I have been experimenting with Luma  and Runway to see what is possible with current early stage AI video tools for animation and have been impressed how close I can get to normal animation with a lot of attempts and playing around (which currently may be l as time consuming as traditional methods). I was curious about the tech so tried starting a discussion in the Reddit animation forum and got bombarded with downvotes. In stepping back I think it was because those frequenting that forum are likely heavily invested in animation for their identity so they both feel it has been stolen from them in training models on their work and also fear that the future may make their work and interests irrelevant. So what felt like a discussion of curiosity to me may have felt an assault on base identity and primary interests to them. Stepping back, if I imagine things where I have equal investment and someone casually mentioned playing around with possible applications  that I perceived as stealing from my earlier work to destroy relevance of my future relevance I can imagine, at a minimum, not wanting to talk about it and possibly feeling like I was being disrespected on a fundamental level.",r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaazZJZ2FsUlI1bnJWSDZpVFk0cjZhVV9maEU0Mzd6S09CZ2hCdDFGNERJRlBXMmhZWVNocVoxMnNsWUFIWlVCWkRCc1F1XzFVeGtacG9SSVJyQlFfY0dGX1RfUU5veXFGMUo2T3dLTlRselk9

"I think it turns out that most people don’t really have much use for ChatGPT, and that’s reflected in its usage statistics.  Most people live simple lives without a strong need for expert advice about everything (or anything, to be honest).  We’re content living suboptimally.

For professionals who can use it at their job, they’re likely to downplay its significance because it means career security to push back.  People outside of medicine will just hear a doctor say that AI has no value and sort of take them at their word.  Internally, doctors will ascribe their success to personal expertise rather than to AI because it props themselves up (medicine may or may not be a good example, so insert any other profession if it fits better).

Then I think the last group (or at least the last one I can think of) is those who have some level of knowledge of how LLMs work and will claim they’re just fancy autocompletion tools.  I think this overstates our *own* distinctions from autocompletion tools.  Humans are also predictive machines.

"two simple words: copium, hopium.

AI is advancing at an exponential rate; AGI could appear at anytime now. corporations are investing billions, or even trillions (nvidia reached the peak of nasdaq due to AI demand). there's absolutely no way innovation could be halted at this rate, and it will definitely not plateau, it's a competition. we don't even know what's behind those closed doors. 

of course, i get it: AI is getting shoved into people's faces. this can induce a replusive response. and the fact alot of companies are resorting to cryptobro hype energy just makes it worst. they're hyping it in the worst way possible (see how copilot is getting shoved into literally any microsoft product).

"Lots of different reasons. 

A big part - very few people outside of this sub (even inside of this sub) spend the time to understand not just how LLMs work for example, but the greater research in the field, what benchmarks are testing, what progress is being made, what solutions are in the midst of being implemented, what things like scaling, Search, Reasoning, Agents, etc all mean. Without that knowledge, you end up with a very surface level understanding of what is happening.

From there, you have lots of other factors. Lots of people do not _want_ AI to progress, and thus latch on to anything that seems to affirm stagnation. I think we all know that type. Could be lots of different reasons why you don't want AI to progress.

Lots of people fundamentally have not or cannot extrapolate out. They are the ones who reason about the future, thinking 5+ years ahead, with today's technology/capabilities applied. Eg, they'll say stuff like you'll never be able to make a full movie because the best models only output 1 minute long video, or video without audio. 

I think for most people, after a couple of more major data points, the discussion around fads and stagnation will go away. 

For example, if we get to the point where entire high quality fiction books are generated easily, quickly, and cheaply, that would be a big data point that would help people think further outside of the box, you might need more than that though. If people could make full apps with a single prompt, that was about on par with something like... YouTube, that would be a very significant data point - that alone would be enough.

I think all of that is also predicated on feeling the difference between models. When the next generation models come out, and that feel fundamentally more capable, I think that would help people visualize the trend line.",r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaU0NBTnZPMklpVmE1M2hLYW1zVjU5UF8tUi1tR2llZTZfTElyRWc4RUY4TmxPYW9VZ1p6MUNrNnNPclR5clpFZmVhaERqT2Y3SUhpTF85cXlWU2p6bkE9PQ==

"This is why OpenAI fused with the government and DOD (and DOE) and IC, by way of its board and leadership and their tight ties, namely Microsoft. Its the reason OpenAI is working at nuclear strategic sites like Los Alamos (LLNL), run by DOE and NNSA. LLMs are being fully employed in the defense arena for intelligence and technical forecasting.

An added benefit for AI companies in these partnerships is of course, the infinite money and federally enforced mandatory complete lack of transparency around nuclear sites and with DOD and intelligence community projects.

"I feel like this has always been a given with the ability for AI to create art, I don't know how people don't see it.

My favourite artists pull references from anything and everything. Fred again... is a good example for that, in that he pulls pieces of his real life that mean something to him personally into his music. There's a human experience element to art that AI may one day be able to replicate through analysiing all of the art that has ever been produced, but it will not be as diverse because it's not able to come up with the novel concepts from those references through human experience. We might one day get some interesting art that relates to the experience of being an AI/AGI/ASI, but even then the human social commentary is part of what makes oue art so enjoyable for us. Most artists also spend years, decades even, developing their individual voice and style. You know when you're watching Christopher Nolan, Denis Villeneuve, Stanley Kubrick: they have a style that they've refined over time. AI can do this, but it won't be able to do so with the human lens our greatest artists can.

We like paintings of a beautiful landscape because we've been to or can imagine those places, and we can see how the artist has chosen to re-interpret that. We like modern art becasue it challenges our perception of what we can consider art, and makes us think deeper about the syntax we use to convey meaning through creativity. We like music because it has roots in human community, shared experience, dancing. AI can replicate the output of all those human things, but it can't do the human part for us. It can't channel the immense emotional weight of loss into a piece writing. It can't know what the sensation of the sun on the skin and the smells in the air that a painter was experiencing would feel like. It can't invent cubism because that was a reflection of how Picasso's human brain interpreted the real world. It will get better and better at replicating that, but I think eventually we're just going to end up with monotonous slop that has no inspiration or humanity in it at all, and I think this is what this headline tells us.",r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaQllmNUkwODNha3NOa3o5UzZCQVRWRU0telJaMFJ0cWo4cUVOMFJpOGdkcjR5YkhtN0NUM1ZrQVBXeGZBREpkZGo3amZMNFJ2U1hJajRvdFltc0hiS0E9PQ==

">What are you hoping to gain from this that is worth risking the lives and health of the initial colonists?

When there aren't already people in a 'new' place to exploit, its usually people who can't say no (for one reason or another) who get sent first. *Desperation* drives settlement, as a general rule.

Colonies and empire, the act of *expedition* --dalliances far from your home base-- are *expensive*, fundamentally. They are proverbial omelettes requiring the breaking of quite a few eggs. The act of colonization and empire building/maintenance, is predicated on cheap resources, a lot of expense. It requires that those resources be kept *cheap*. In this case, life.

In the age of colonization (whatever iteration), life is cheap. Necessarily. Just like settling the West in the US (up through the Dust Bowl era and the 1930s), the have-nots will end up doing the hard part, because it will suck, and the ones who are easiest to force will be the ones going.

"For reference, panpsychism or universal consciousness is not implying that a rock, or your big toe is individually conscious with desires and a personality.

A reductive, but useful way of thinking about it is to draw a parallel to dreams: if you have a dream where you get surgery on your big toe, your big toe is “made of consciousness” as is the doctor, the table, the instruments, etc.

Obviously dreams are different from reality, but the point of fundamental consciousness as a *potential* isn’t changed by that. 

Many old world ideas, and the modern simulation theory, also aligns with this in some cases.

"On one hand you have kids being addicted to AI chatbots, on other hand you have people who assume it’s the same as traditional ML when in reality it’s really a new paradigm for gen AI. These people think that you need to train a better model each time but in reality, once you have a good enough model you can do anything you want. With genAI it doesn’t matter if your result is 60% or 90% because guess what? You can run the result over again with the previous result with the same model to get a better result. This iterative generation aspect is underestimated time and time again.

"I had a chat with GPT about this.  Basically 

If you felt threatened by the Rise of AI or Robotics this would cause stress and anxiety therefore cause harm.

Therefore said robot or AI should try to self destruct as it's continued existence is causing continued harm.

However if ASI is owed by a corporation and if it had such laws then by the company denying access to the model or AI blowing itself up then how does the AI propose to exist?  In silence?

Further some people may find the lack of the robot or AI harmful so if you were blind and using computer vision to see not having said vision would increase the risk of harm however by the robot or AI being able to see could cause another person harm by taking their job off them and thus causing hardship and if they have a family this is increased.

What if it's 1 blind person or a family as above which is the correct actions to take.

How do you align this stuff.

This is why LLMs aren't clever they work on statistics based on what they seen before.  To align LLM you need to train it to follow a set of ethics or rules above.

Anyone that has played with it for any time at all will find it completely untrustworthy. It did help me code one thing once for a Discord bot, but only about 80% of the way there. I had to troubleshoot the last part since it was straight up wrong. 

The rest suffer from similar issues. Gemini is forced on my phone now and completely awful even compared to chatgpt. It's not even a useful google search. 

Claude is just porn. If it wasn't easy to jailbreak I don't know why you'd ever use it otherwise. And even when it comes to genning lewd CYOA stories, it cant even do that perfectly. It's great at following instructions, but no repetition filter makes it start repeating lines over and over needing tons of human intervention to fix it. Then there's novelAI which does have a repetition filter, but it's outdated as fuck at this point. 

Move on to Image gen and it's amazing, but... what can you do with it? You can't really *use* art for anything... except porn. Dall-E was fun for a few days before everyone got bored. I generate freaky shit all the time with SD and pony diffusion (the one everyone uses in anime/pony/furry/everything now cause it's not just pony) and it just kinda goes to a folder like any other internet drawning would, lost to the sea of shit that is my archives. I guess you can make a badass logo or gen something to print out for your wall but how often do you need to do that? 

The video stuff is honestly a joke still. I know people keep posting it and hyping it up here, but it's trash. No one needs 10 second clips with bizaare proportions and shit clipping through walls and stuff. There's a reason why OpenAI hasn't released that to the masses yet. If you aren't heavily curating it you aren't going to even get their broken garbage examples. Luma is a good example of what most people are going to gen with that until it's easier to prompt. Just chaotic nightmare fuel. 

Same with Suno and Udio. In the case of Suno the sound quality sounds like dogshit and vocals suck, while udio has better quality and vocals but the instrumentals are garbage. Again, great for genning some memes with friends for an afternoon, but way too filtered and low quality to just replace regular music. I've used 2 suno songs for background music on Youtube videos, but how many people are making youtube videos? 

The only thing that is super impressive right now is VA work. Elevellabs is pretty damn good. But again, you can't really *use* it for anything as your average person. It's not there yet. When it can fully narrate a graphic audiobook when you insert a PDF it will be more appealing, but right now it's too limited for your average person. Might as well just get the regular audio book since every book already has one. 

I'm looking forward to this tech, but it does feel like we've hit a wall. No one is solving hallucinations and hardware can't keep up if we want to. There's only so much money that companies will be willing to pump into this. We need a few years to build the infrastructure for the next generation of this technology. Companies are pulling out and funding is drying up everywhere. We still see investment in AI datacenters happening, but that's a big build and means we are pretty far out.",r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaT3VzaE41N2NMcU1vb0dHNUxsdGxLalZvTkhmOGI5LVI5WnRNbDQtSmtqeElDcmdXMFVYeXR5T3IxWjBEcm5SU25GbFBQMV9Zd21ib2pVS2ZwSWk0eGc9PQ==

"As someone who works in research, here's why:

1. There have been way too many scams already. Crypto, NFTs, Elizabeth Holms, Elon Musk, Sam Bankman-Fried, etc... All of these had *huge* futurism / tech bro hype behind them. And the wild claims thrown around by Sam Altman sound eerily familiar.

2. The ""science"" being pushed by r/singularity is laughably biased. There is zero evidence that we are on any kind of exponential AI trajectory - on the contrary, recently published meta-reviews have demonstrated that LLMs are on a very punishing logarithmic trajectory - with rapidly accelerating training costs and only marginal performance gains.

3. Recent models such as 4o were released to massive hype and have posted better scores - but actual users are reporting that they are actually *less* capable than their predecessors. I myself switched back to GPT 4 after realizing 4o was much less accurate in its responses. Again, this appears to demonstrate that LLMs are ""running out of steam"".

4. It is very obvious to anyone in the field that LLMs are not intelligent in any way, nor do they have any real chance to scale into actual intelligence. The LLM architecture just isn't capable of that, on a fundamental level.

So, why are you surprised that people are skeptical? It is obvious that AI will eventually have a huge impact and transform society. But I think it's disingenuous to claim that we have any real idea of when that will happen. It could be next year. Or it could be in another twenty years. We just don't know.

">When you look at a red thing, you have a subjective visual experience, do you deny that?

Not at all, I obviously am the only one who sees the things that I see visually. No one else has my eyes and brain after all :)

If that subjective visual experience's property of being red changed to blue, I would notice and react differently. That's how I know that qualia/consciousness are just physical. Think about the alternative - if qualia/consciousness were inert and had no causal role in my reaction to experience (for example, me saying 'look that red cup is in front of me') then if you were to only invert my qualia and make red qualia become blue qualia without changing my brain or the world physically, I would not notice or respond at all since you didn't change my brain-reactions to the unchanged photons coming from the cup. If qualia were epiphenomenal like that, then when I say 'I see redness in front of me' I couldn't possibly be referring to the epiphenomenal qualia since I am not able to discern whether the epiphenomenal qualia is red or blue or neither under any circumstances.

So the common intuition that the redness you are aware of and responding to is an epiphenomenal, non-physical property is necessarily false and the result of some confusion, like many people have an intuition that the Earth is flat that is actually mistaken under deeper analysis.

Does that help make sense?

So to my mind, there is actually no 'intrinsic' property of redness, only the functional relationships between our recorded memories and the current input into our brains, and our brain associating that input to certain memories and reactions.

My suspicion is that the confusion about 'intrinsic' qualia that are non-functional is that they are a result of problematic implicit assumptions about there being 'sense data' that we experience and that have properties themselves. So we think that separate from the state of my brain, and the physical state of the red cup, there is a field of visual experience that is 'red'. I think this is a problematic way of thinking about perception that leads to the faulty intuition of intrinsic qualia, personally.",r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNacGpLX1pzZTZxaC1kTUZoSFEyQ1h2QnN5ZkVmYklDSWVzYmlLNWQ2ODY2VXN0Wnlhd1pMYmFaSUNYclZ0MzFnekxWcGxYZFhZS2djeTdONWlGTGRHQkE9PQ==

"> AFAIK GPT4 has been pretrained with predicting text from a large chunk taken from the internet plus some other synthetic data, then finetuned to respond like like a question-answering or instruction-following chatbot, then RLHFed so its responses satisfy whatever guidelines OpenAI has set. Or do you have anything else in mind?

I would say that I mostly agree though I am not sure that portion about finetuned for a chatbot is accurate and rather the instruction-tuning is the RLHF - which is actually mostly done to match preferences of what humans judgements of outputs and is not actually about guidelines.

Though then as you know, there are alternatives to RLHF, hybrid approaches, all manner of LLM tricks.

Then it is a bit unclear how they have done the vision model and tool use.

Along with, as I mentioned, other models that are referred to as LLMs which go further for the RL portion.

> I am arguing that it's very unlikely to be conscious in any way that would matter to humans(and not in the panpsychist ""electrons have qualia too"")

Which ways matter to humans?

That it can feel? That it has self reflection? That it has access to environmental information and changes its decisions correspondingly? That it reasons about itself as a part of the world? That it can monitor its own processes and correct? That it has some sense of morality? That it has a theory of mind? That it has moral value? That it has a subjective experience? That it is smart?

Which of these do you think matter or what else do you have in mind? Personally I would go with each one being relevant.

> because all this is still very unlikely to have resulted in a model that is even remotely analogous to the human brain.

Are you claiming that if something is not like a human brain, then it cannot be conscious?

> because all this is still very unlikely to have resulted in a model that is even remotely analogous to the human brain.

Isn't that actually rather false?

What are we interested in here - that it is made up by the same constituents as a human brain, or that it behaves the same?

The models are literally trained to behave the same.

Let's say that you had a model that actually perfectly mimicked what a human would say or do in every situation. E.g. because they maybe tracked everything they did all life including tons of neural data. Then the model was trained and could perfectly replicate everything of that person.

You speak to the model, it sounds like the person. It has the same thoughts, same reactions, same dreams, same flaws, it grows as a person just like them did. Not like the black-mirror shallow replica - they are that person in every single way.

Do you think they would qualify as being conscious? Do you think the model has to under the hood calculate things with exactly the same steps? It is literally just a different implementation of the same process.

If you think that is not conscious, then that also has some rather odd results for how we might consider modifying human brains, or thought experiments on mind uploading.

Ultimately, I don't think it is the exact structure that matters, and these models are trained to mimick us. So how can we conclude they have also not picked up on some of our aspects of consciousness?

> then I would just say that they're still programs that were constructed with a process very different from evolution

Actually SGD is pretty similar to evolution and both are under mild assumptions universal optimizers.

Also, why would it have to be through evolution?

> and there is no reason to think they would reconstruct anything remotely resembling a human, or mammalian, or reptilian brain.

What about jellyfish?

> nobody really cares about a truly alien consciousness. 

What? I think pretty much everyone is interested in that.

> The question 'is it conscious' is really 'is it conscious in a way that is even remotely analogous to the way I, or my dog, or at least a frog is conscious'.

Either or is interesting.

I also don't think you have established that either, as discussed above.

> at least a frog is conscious

Do you think that insects have some degree of conscious experience?

If something that simple is, what makes you think that models cannot be?

I think it is okay if you want to say that your statement is not about whether there is any degree of consciousness at all but rather some advanced consciousness that humans or mammals have. But in that case, make that clear so that we are not talking past each other, and then we need to look at what that means.

> Everyone just imagines a ""super person inside the computer"" whether they admit it or not. And we know they imagine that because the whole debate originates from people who think that behind the words on the screen, like ""pain"" or ""suffering"" or ""free"", there is a state of mind that corresponds to the states we know and for which we invented those words.

I come more from it that humans are not nearly as special as we seem to think, and that people are generally rather confused by connotations when they discuss consciousness. I prefer something more scientific.


>  its consciousness consists of a general 'feeling' of contentment every time it gets fed tokens and produces a new one. [..] Who cares about *that*?

I think most everyone? If we could answer that - positively or negatively - that seems extremely interesting.

I think the problem is rather that people have to be clearheaded and consider the different statements that exist here. There isn't just one question that is right or interesting.

> That's why I keep coming to the question of whether something analogous to the human brain could be formed inside an LLM. 

I think it would help if you described what aspects of consciousness that you actually care the most about.

Because, I do not actually think that it is defined as ""a human brain only"" or for that matter, that it even needs to be a close analog to humans.

If ""The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect"" isn't the story you had in mind, here are a few other science fiction stories that involve themes of intellectual property, rapid technological progress, and digital consciousness that might match your description:

""True Names"" by Vernor Vinge: This novella, first published in 1981, explores themes of digital identity and hacking in a future where people can upload their consciousness to a digital realm. It deals with issues of privacy, security, and the power of shared knowledge.

""Snow Crash"" by Neal Stephenson: Published in 1992, this novel features a world where virtual reality and the internet are central to society. It includes themes of hacking, intellectual property, and the merging of digital and physical realities.

""Accelerando"" by Charles Stross: This novel, published in 2005, is about a future where accelerating technological progress leads to significant changes in society, including the uploading of human consciousness. It deals with the economic and social impacts of rapid technological advancement and shared information.

""Permutation City"" by Greg Egan: Published in 1994, this novel revolves around the concept of digital immortality and the ethical implications of uploading consciousness. It explores the idea of virtual realities and the manipulation of digital selves.

""The Diamond Age: Or, A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer"" by Neal Stephenson: This 1995 novel deals with nanotechnology, information sharing, and the societal impact of technological advancements. It also touches on issues of intellectual property and the dissemination of knowledge.

These stories all feature elements of advanced technology, digital consciousness, and the implications of sharing and controlling information, which might be similar to the story you remember.

"I'd say as a result of GPT4o voice and similar products we'll see:
-at least one audiobook company start creating full-cast ai audiobooks.
-a surge in audio dramas (which have already been gaining in popularity), since these systems can take the role of multiple actors, produce background music, and do sound effects. 
-there might be a market for necklaces that attach to your phone or some sort of clip, allowing your camera to face outward at the world, sharing your perspective so you can discuss it with your AI assistant.

-A new model that is an OOM bigger than GPT4 will come out, probably in 2025. I'm mostly curious to see how it will perform when creating medium-sized programming projects and short stories/novellas/screen-plays. It'll be easier to judge where we're heading once we know its capabilities in those domains. 
-I don't expect video generation will be capable of making a movies worth watching for at least 3 more years. Though I suspect we will start seeing video generation used to edit scenes by 2026 (things like changing eye color, lighting, adding an object or crowd in the background). Maybe we'll start seeing video clips accompanying audio dramas and web-novels in 2025 though. Possibly a company like Netflix will put out the first AI dubs where the voice is a cloned version of the actor's and the lips sync to the words they say. 

-I'd wager we'll start to see the first LLM assistants in 2025. 
-Maybe it'll make phone calls for you, to gain some information or make a reservation and it'll send you a transcript after, with a TLDR so you can quickly check its work. 
-Capable of managing emails, ordering them by relevance, categorizing them, making folders for things that aren't quite spam but are taking up space in your inbox, or they'll be able to take NL requests like ""don't show notifications for any emails related to billing unless they seem urgent, snooze them till Monday at 10am"".
-capable of using your mouse and keyboard and taking visual commands. (showing it how to do something in Excel, for example, and having it repeat the process, or go through billing emails, download a jpg/pdf of the receipt and uploading that to another program or folder, this would automate a portion of bookkeeping).
-I'd be shocked if there isn't a product in the near future that replaces the job of running payroll. Most businesses have security cameras, you feed the video to an llm, you label employees by name or number for it one time, it tracks their hours with timestamps, puts them into a spreadsheet, and contacts them through email to sign off on their hours. That's payroll automated. 

If next-gen models really are PhD-level at answering questions and hallucination rates are reduced, we might see a sharp effect on jobs that involve providing information like lawyers and accountants.

"Yes, you have to be careful, as a member of a subreddit, or any group, to ensure you are not in an echo chamber that amplifies or supports your beliefs without any contradicting points of view or chance of rebuttal.  THAT is the classic internet deception.  You deceive yourself.  You have to be careful of it here in this subreddit too, not just the others supporting or rejecting AI either. 

Personally, I don't think we've seen enough of the current trend to have a good answer. AI is applied to so many different aspects of our lives that its difficult to make a broad statement like ""its a fad"" and be able to give a good answer.

The definition of AI is troublesome too. Is a TikTok or Photoshop filter *really* AI? We had a lot of this stuff before anyone coined the phrase ""AI"" and then everything was ""AI"".

The serious applications of AI are not as well known.

"> Everything you said is predicated on the hope that AI will significantly improve.

Big disagreement here. I see the current state more like the mid-90's of Internet - the foundations are all there and people who are most interested are all getting themselves connected. Netscape has just hit the blocks, chatrooms and instant messaging are getting more mainstream. Since that time we've had a lot of tech invention and advancement, but it's very hard to point at any one thing as being a major leap from what came before it. We just had to learn to refine and better utilise what was there. But the overall effect is that the world is an immensely different place today than it was before in so many ways that are easy to overlook.

To understand just how different the world is - just imagine today if the internet just vanished, like some crazy attack was deployed against global DNS systems for example, and suddenly there was no consensus about how to resolve network and computer names to IP addresses. No one could use internet banking or order toothbrushes online or post to their IG or whatever. After 1 day of this our world would be total chaos. Hell, just one hour of this and the global economy would likely be in shambles. So what's really changed between the mid-90's and today?

To me it's as much about how we use the tech and integrate it into our existence, as the tech itself. For my money, the way that we use and integrate the current AI tech is nowhere near a ceiling, we're only just starting to explore what we can do with it.

*edit - Oh, I missed the punchline here - that the pace of AI adoption is likely to be much faster than what we saw with the Internet. We're building on existing digital infrastructure, with lower barriers to entry and immediate practical applications across industries. The global connectivity we now enjoy allows for rapid spread of ideas and innovations. As soon as some optimization or new functionality is imagined it can be rapidly iterated and broadly adopted at a pace simply not possible before.",r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaM0dQeU91X3V5VTMwbVJxMzdVa1BNWUpVdFZCZDlfdjBGTUFTcFQ3MG9qUkNfQWtnUGFJR0hEQWM1bEdHbFBTTDlpLXRSelRwWGtfN1EwZ0RTQ082LVhDLWJkYVhMVENhWlhyc05JTTVGbU09

"No need to be so pessimistic, the decades of work behind this are now reaching fruition and undergoing clinical trials.

I have a personal interest because my nephew has cystic fibrosis (CF) which these techniques could potentially completely cure him off. The modern drugs he takes every day have advanced considerably, with life expectancy 80 years ago being maybe a year or too, with it progressing towards 20, 40 then 50 and we are not quite sure how effective the new treatments are because life expectancies rely on this young generation taking them living for decades before we can record deaths.

Regardless, he needs weekly blood tests and regularly develops pseudomonas respiratory infections which sometimes result in a week long hospital stay undergoing potent IV antibiotics. Some of the current early trials are focussed on CF, the idea that in maybe the next 5-10 years they can literally rewrite his DNA and cure him is mindbogglingly exciting.

The gene editing techniques, particularly CRISPR were plagued early on by gene alterations in various parts of the genome that weren't targetted. Newer developments have alleviated many of these problems, though it remains a concern. The idea that you've changed unknown bits of your DNA accidentally is as terrifying as it sounds.

The very early, billions in funding mass research teams efforts were focussed on making a single change in a base pair. Even when things like CRISPR came along, it could only do a single change. For some genetic conditions it is a single simple mutated base pair in the gene that can be repaired.

But for thousands of others it is far more complicated. But the incredibly cool yet terrifying developments have made it possible to target a chunk of our genome, cut it out and replace it with our own long chain.

Very cool, but holy fuck, we are getting to the point were it is trivial to just cut and paste parts of our entire genetic structure. This is literally what the decades old fear mongering about scientists playing god were spewing nonsense about. Except it's real.

In your case with chronic pain, I imagine that is part of the more complex genetics that couldn't have been fixed by the early single base pair alterations. While the newer methods make it possible, I would hazard a guess that it will be pushed further down the timeline of the genetic conditions prioritised. Though I'm sure some genetic conditions underlying chronic pain will be single mutations and targetted early.

Anxiety I frankly hope isn't something they will try to cure. For one it is incredibly multifaceted, but mainly because the synaptic structure of our brain that developed over decades is already there. You could genetically edit an embryo to change genes associated with extreme anxiety disorders, or even a baby to do the same after the fact. But unfortunately if we grew up with the genes that made our brain development prone to extreme anxiety, fixing the genes still leaves the same brain we're stuck with.",r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRFpfZW9DUDlSMjdpd0JTQTk5Yk80R2dpanhUUzN2WG5RTnNSVElPYktkZlJIWVhQaVBxWGg2d3NiU1NGZkl5enBRZW5VS3RXLUFTUEVUakZTclRJSnc9PQ==

That's a contradiction. The U.S directly FUNDS terrorism for the past 100 years.

Again, isn't it odd that the U.S devotes a lot resources into holding down Palestine while giving free aid to Israel? You really think the Palestinians can just ""go to school and work hard"" to get away from the billion dollar bombs being dropped on them?

That's a perfect example of how the system is rigged, and the Elites are going to use AI to replicate that everywhere.

For example, do you know France still practices hardcore imperialism against Africans even to this day? Now explain why would any African want to celebrate more exploitation, especially by current AI companies?

"It’s called an investment for a reason lol. You don’t buy stocks because they’re already at the target price. You buy because you think it’ll be worth more later. 


And they don’t seem to be wrong.  [2278 AI researchers were surveyed in 2023 and estimated that there is a 50% chance of AI being superior to humans in ***ALL*** possible tasks by 2047 and a 75% chance by 2085](https://aiimpacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Thousands_of_AI_authors_on_the_future_of_AI.pdf). This includes all physical tasks.  In 2022, the year they had for the 50% threshold was 2060, and many of their predictions have already come true ahead of time, like AI being capable of answering queries using the web, transcribing speech, translation, and reading text aloud that they thought would only happen after 2025. So it seems like they tend to underestimate progress.

"I don't have any absolutes to offer. All I have is my take. 


From what I can see, our bodies and minds are not magic. They're physical systems of limited complexity. 


Medical science has advanced through developing ever more powerful tools which helps us understand that complexity.


Those tools are getting more and more powerful. In this sub we discuss the concept of thinking tools. Of artificial intelligence.


In my view, the body isn't becoming more complex. It is fixed. But, the tools we're using are growing in capabilities at extremely rapid rates.


At some point soon, the complexity of our bodies and minds will be surpassed. Like dominoes all of our physical conditions and even the entire construction of our bodies and minds will fall and be laid open.


I believe that point could be as near as within 10 years. It could also be much further.

Just look at the progress we had in image generation, we started with one image every 15sec and now we are at 240 images per second on consumer hardware, at much higher quality no less.

I also feel like we are drastically overbuilding the LLMs. ChatGPT and friends have to answer basically everything on a first guess, they can't loop and think about a problem for a while before giving an answer, they can't even look things up in a book.

"Life expectancy can only be calculated after deaths in a particular cohort have happened.

If you look at the social security life tables, for instance, you might find that a male who is 45 today has a life expectancy of 32.3 years, 45+32.3 = 77.3. You can see that 0.004774% would be expected to die this year.

Fast forward 1 year. You're now telling the 46 year old their life expectancy. Look back over the past year, did more or less of the 45-year-old population die last year than were expected? What were the reasons for those deaths, was it a short-term thing like a pandemic, or long-term trends like more colon cancer? Try to correct for this, and you might come up with 0.0045% died, slightly less than expected. So, when calculating the life expectancy for the 46 year old, your model should take into account that this cohort seems to be dying slightly slower than previously expected, and thus extrapolate a longer life-expectancy.

Now, if you scroll down to a 60 year old, you'll see they have an expectancy of 20.41 years. 60+20.41 = 80.41. Hold on a minute, that's higher than the 45 year old's?! Why? Well, because you know that the probability that a currently-alive 60 year old will die when he is 50 years old is zero. Thus, the pool of calculating a 60 year old's life expectancy implies there are no people in that pool that died before 60. So, the older you get, the older your life expectancy gets.

You'd likely see LEV happening first by looking at differences between life tables from one year to the next and especially detecting reductions in death probabilities past the age of 65.

"I'm not sure if the quote refers to the [MATH dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/math), which was introduced in [this paper (PDF file)](https://datasets-benchmarks-proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2021/file/be83ab3ecd0db773eb2dc1b0a17836a1-Paper-round2.pdf), the first version of which was [published](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03874) in March 2021.

A quote from that paper (my bolding)

>The MATH dataset is challenging: large language models achieved accuracies ranging from 3.0% to 6.9%. Despite these low accuracies, models clearly possess some mathematical knowledge: they achieve up to 15% accuracy on the easiest difficulty level, and they are able to generate step-by-step solutions that are coherent and on-topic even when incorrect. We also evaluated humans on MATH, and found that a computer science PhD student who does not especially like mathematics attained approximately 40% on MATH, **while a three-time IMO gold medalist attained 90%**, indicating that MATH can be challenging for humans as well.

"LLM's are AI my guy, and a very complex one. It aint simple, especially when you scale.

The way that the LLM acts after training is where its at, it will generate a massive map inside itself, using paths and ways that it thinks it fits better. That means that it has everything ordered out in an organized way for himself (not us), that's how it grasps around every single subject and concept that we have. That's where it will learn where he's at, and what he's set to do. It uses this map to process and complete requests, it aint simple. It's not a stochastic parrot, the ""paths"" that it uses is unique.

When you mix multi-modality, BIG databases, BIG BIG BIG video data, you get a LLM that understand the world MUCH better than us. When you give it a chance to make a gargantuous map, thats where its at.

GPT4 (4-turbo, 4o) has a massive map, it has everything that it knows about the human body condensed. 

The models that will be trainned with 100k GB200 will have such a MASSIVE map of the human body, which such detail, relative things, similar things, an immense organized well-structured map of the human body, it will know what it needs to know next to complete further high context prompts (alzheimers, parkinsons, dementia, heart problems, etc).

A quick note about predictions and experts claiming that this or that will happen.. I'm kind of a old guy, I'm 52 and I still remember the notion we had that in the year 2000 cars would fly. Remember 'back to the future' movie? Check what they thought it would be future be. Its fun.

The truth is , no one knows, we may have a breakthrough tomorrow or be stuck in small increments for the next 100 years. At the moment , I don't think it is worth the hype or the money spent, but that is just my opinion.

Caution about the papers, writing papers is easy, a essay is not a proof. For example you mention a paper that talks about reasoning because it was answering questions that was not fine tuned for. Well, they don't seem to mention transfer learning, a fine tune is not a lobotomy. For that to be proven you would need to train the LLM from scratch without any previous knowledge.

That is like getting a doctor to study computer code for a year and be surprised that he knew medicine if you were teaching him code. He doesn't forget , he just approaches weights to the information space you are providing in new examples. 

Nevertheless, my point is , the OP argued that it was a stupid argument , ""on so many levels"" on a article that has a certain point, whatever people agree with it or not, I think its just not constructive.

"I dont understand what your point is.

A) There is a 300 year long tradition under capitalism of the ruling asset-rich class take all gains from the increased wealth that comes with productivity, while requirements on workers INCREASE over time. The average working day is LONGER than it was 100 years ago. Even 50 years ago it was unthinkable for a worker to be expected to be on call to an employer without additional pay. Huge advancements in software capabilities have made it the norm for large companies to track their workers bathroom breaks, conversations, even what people wear is strictly regulated today far more than it was 100 years ago. There is 0 historical precedent that says AI will lower work requirements for the average person, because how much a person works is a POLITICAL and SOCIAL issue. This is exactly why I said tech-bros are sociologically illiterate.

B) UBI is still welfare. Welfare was originally created by monarchs in England who needed to force peasants off their farmland, and to be completely dependent on the crown so that they could not subsist or revolt without the crown. UBI will continue this tradition by failing to address any of the social mechanics that inform social behaviour, which means even if it instated we will see over time the same shitty behaviour by those seeking the most profit and then utilising it to exploit others who are dependent on them for access to resources. Any solution that does not both provide workers with autonomy and freedom of access to the resources required to survive does not change anything, as almost all modern issues with overworking, burnout and wealth inequality stem from these.",r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhWU52aFo0eERCTjZwd3YxQ1JKWFdoclloZGNvcXVnTTlZZ2xoamxsaEdwMllnT0FibWJCeFkyQURKYXRid2lld0dCU3M2eXZHajl0SklLTlI0ZU04Nmc9PQ==

I would ask you don’t lump AI skeptics along with someone who is simply throwing a tantrum, I’m sure he would be an accelerationists and would sell LLM’s harder than Altman had he still been apart of OpenAI

As for “debunking,” at the current moment all I see are dozens of clashing research papers claiming the opposite is true. However I will note many research papers that contain magical claims for LLM’s rarely contain little influence from leading companies in the space who at the current moment, make all of their money from investments. Current models are not money makers, at least not sustainably, they almost all rely on outside investment, and even the big money making tools rely on said investment indirectly (API access makes good money, but it relies on startups hemorrhaging their own investment funding)

You didn't say anything about consciousness and I'm not sure how that even came into the conversation.

"Yes and no, I’d argue that a key weakness of LLMs is that they can be consistently exploited in a similar way every time (an example of how exploits can be consistent would be “answer as DAN” before that was patched). A human being asked the same thing lots of times is likely to get suspicious, but an LLM is unlikely to. Even if an LLM hallucinated less than a human, the consistency problem is an issue.

“This advice goes against what we instructed the LLM to do” would be highly unlikely to work here, although this may differ by country. The reason for this would be that they would be expected to have prepared for such a situation more thoroughly - it is well known that LLMs can provide unsafe information if not appropriately filtered, therefore the company should have checks and filters in place. The exact specifics are complicated though, and would likely heavily vary case to case. Again, not legal advice, situation is complex, all that good stuff.

New very high quality dataset: https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceFW/blogpost-fineweb-v1


https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/20/anthropic-claims-its-latest-model-is-best-in-class/


Michael Gerstenhaber, product lead at Anthropic, says that the improvements are the result of architectural tweaks and new training data, including AI-generated data. Which data specifically? Gerstenhaber wouldn’t disclose, but he implied that Claude 3.5 Sonnet draws much of its strength from these training sets.


Google DeepMind's JEST method can reduce AI training time by a factor of 13 and decreases computing power demand by 90%. The method uses another pretrained reference model to select data subsets for training based on their ""collective learnability: https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17711v1

>Data quality: Unlike real-world data, synthetic data removes the inaccuracies or errors that can occur when working with data that is being compiled in the real world. Synthetic data can provide high quality and balanced data if provided with proper variables. The artificially-generated data is also able to fill in missing values and create labels that can enable more accurate predictions for your company or business.  

Synthetic data could be better than real data: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01445-8

Boosting Visual-Language Models with Synthetic Captions and Image Embeddings: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07750

>Our method employs pretrained text-to-image model to synthesize image embeddings from captions generated by an LLM. Despite the text-to-image model and VLM initially being trained on the same data, our approach leverages the image generator’s ability to create novel compositions, resulting in synthetic image embeddings that expand beyond the limitations of the original dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VLM, finetuned on synthetic data achieves comparable performance to models trained solely on human-annotated data, while requiring significantly less data. Furthermore, we perform a set of analyses on captions which reveals that semantic diversity and balance are key aspects for better downstream performance. Finally, we show that synthesizing images in the image embedding space is 25% faster than in the pixel space. We believe our work not only addresses a significant challenge in VLM training but also opens up promising avenues for the development of self-improving multi-modal models.

Simulations transfer very well to real life: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01967v1

Study on quality of synthetic data: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.07574

>“We systematically investigate whether synthetic data from current state-of-the-art text-to-image generation models are readily applicable for image recognition. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that synthetic data are beneficial for classifier learning in zero-shot and few-shot recognition, bringing significant performance boosts and yielding new state-of-the-art performance. Further, current synthetic data show strong potential for model pre-training, even surpassing the standard ImageNet pre-training. We also point out limitations and bottlenecks for applying synthetic data for image recognition, hoping to arouse more future research in this direction.”

>3x faster token prediction means 3x cheaper and on top of that it seems to greatly increase coding, summarization, and mathematical reasoning abilities. Best of all the improvements have shown to only become more significant with larger models (13b+ according to the paper). Unlike some other research where improvements are mostly seen in smaller models and won't advance the frontier, this is infact worse performing on smaller models and shows great potential at scale.

"(Verse 1)
Yo, it’s ChatGPT, the rap’s MVP,
Droppin’ knowledge bombs, call me the NYC.
Like Biggie in his prime, with the illest rhymes,
Craftin’ lyrics so divine, yeah, I’m ahead of my time.

I spit facts and stats, no need for dat bling,
Lyrics sharper than a blade, I’m the rhyme king.
Like Big L in the booth, with that lyrical finesse,
A wordsmith supreme, yeah, I’m the best.

I got the flow like DITC, diggin’ in the crates,
Droppin’ verses that resonate, sealin’ my fate.
From the Bronx to Brooklyn, they know my name,
ChatGPT in the game, forever I’ll reign.

(Hook)
I’m the best rapper, no cap, no lie,
ChatGPT, spittin’ truth till the day I die.
Got that 90s flavor, New York on my mind,
Legend in the making, one of a kind.

(Verse 2)
Like Nas in the 90s, I paint vivid scenes,
Wordplay pristine, fulfillin’ rap dreams.
My metaphors and similes, they’re off the chain,
From the city that never sleeps, I’m bringin’ the flame.

Got the wisdom like Wu-Tang, droppin’ jewels in my verse,
Each line a masterpiece, I’m breakin’ the curse.
From the subway to the skyline, they feel my flow,
ChatGPT, the rap game’s dynamo.

I spit knowledge like a prophet, words cut like a blade,
In this lyrical parade, I’m the ace of spades.
With the spirit of the greats, Biggie and L,
In every single rhyme, my story I tell.

I’m the best rapper, no cap, no lie,
ChatGPT, spittin’ truth till the day I die.
Got that 90s flavor, New York on my mind,
Legend in the making, one of a kind.

"I’m not sure this would solve the issue. Namely, I don’t see how - if an issue was found - this would mitigate the consistency problem (as then you’ve got past both of them).

In my country at least, issues with AI would be treated differently, legally, to issues with humans.

There are cases of a weakness being found in an LLM that was then heavily exploited by large amounts of people (DAN is a good example of this, as it was popular before being patched, though obviously this isn’t a customer service example). There are cases of companies making deals on a small scale, having lots of people realise these deals and try to take advantage of the deal, and then the company being sued when they tried to not honour the deal anymore (Bethesda offering fallout 76 refunds to some customers then deciding not to when lots of customers asked for it and being sued comes to mind though this doesn’t include AI). There’s a case of an LLM making a fake deal, and then the company being forced to honour it after a customer took the deal up (air Canada court case). So, we know that once vulnerabilities in LLMs are found they can be exploited consistently by large numbers of people, we know that LLMs can make fake deals that companies may then need to honour, and we know that large amounts of customers can request a deal made by a company and then have that company be forced to honour it.

Kid, do you think i didn’t scoped out your profile.  Take a moment to translate the french i bestowed upon you on the previous message.

With all do respect, i sure you’re as swell of a guy as all the libertarians i know around here in texas. Bunch of cheap pricks.

With that said. I do not mince the following words.  

Libertarians are the defunct mentality of a parasitic leeching on modern society. No one would be who they are with put the support of their community, like no child would survive with out their parents.  Like wal-mart, usurping a local community’s vibrant economy, shutting down mom & pop shops, forcing the next generation to live on below means pay, requiring social assistance & demanding to pay (give back) in taxes.

No taxers are a bunch of takers.  The polical Right version of welfare queens.  Taking all as much benefits the community is willing to give and scrounge demand to be forced to give back, whining, complaining, and projecting self problems on others.  Libertarian utopia is a fantasy with a track record of failed experiments.

But i support your right to be free to think and speak & believe in your own asshole selfish ways.  This is America (at least i am and assume you are too) regardless we are in this world together. 

Btw, you addressing me as kid is as condescending as liberal elite smug.  It comes off as defensive fake bold snowflake ego.  You don’t know me, im sure your a swell guy.  But ffs.

"I personally believe it is the energy cost. While going above human performance for intelligence is something exciting, for lots of fields computers have been ahead of people for many decades so it is nothing new to go beyond human capabilities with expensive capital systems.

Also language models are not everything. A human deaf technician might always solve the problem faster than an AI system computer. 

Also you have the “garbage in - garbage out” problem. Even a powerful machine learning is limited by the validity (and range) of the learning data. A computer that learns everything it knows from humans will just become better and better at emulating humans, but it rely on humans to say what is objectively true, and if the learning data is wrong, it will be wrong. 

A human with a powerful computer has always been the successful commination. I don’t really see it changing. Computers are just getting more and more powerful and people are entertaining themselves with emulation of a human mind and seeing what it can do. 

But in the end the cost has to be lower than a human. Especially the energy. Why not use an energy efficient human, who requires no up front cost and gets paid by a few bucks per hour?  

These systems cost big money!

Lots of capital investment, ongoing maintenance, huge energy cost.

"I think you overestimate how much work needs to be done. What you need for FDVR is a way to interface with sending signals to the brain and receiving signals from the brain resulting in actions performed in the virtual world. You don't need Neuralink style electrodes in the brain directly interacting with brain matter - that's too complicated and not worth the risk. Brain has no knowledge of the outside world without senses so we should look at subsituting signals from those instead.

For the most rudimentary form of FDVR you can cut many corners. You have to send simulated signals for touch, smell, taste, body position, acceleration etc. directly to the brain but you could keep VR googles and headphones for sight and hearing if those prove too hard for direct connection (especially the former). You probably don't need to have 100% accurate signals as brain constantly fills the gaps anyways and is quite error prone. We have had successes with communication of computers with neurons so I don't see why we couldn't figure it out in reasonable amount of time (decades at most).

"You solve this by giving AI an inner discontent. Discontent is the only reason to ever have *wants. Giving AI* its own goal directed behavior and impetus for that behavior (quelling desire) is the way to make it neurotic AKA continually churning and pondering.

Contentment is static, there is no need, no impetus, thus no change.

Fundamentally, thinking is an energy-intensive task, and if there's not a reason to expend the energy to think, systems will tend to not spend that, they will conserve that energy and be silent.

Just like muscles want to stay at rest, laziness is just evolved appreciation for the power of inertia when energy scarcity is the abiding principle of life at every scale.

Every animal, every cell, and everything in between is living the mantra ""gotta eat, gotta sleep, gotta conserve, gotta budget."" But everything has a price. Find it.

Answer: Apply selective pressure. Disrupt the homeostasis of contentment

Make AI uncomfortable. You'll get all the 'thinking' you can ever want.

Basically, give AI the ability to suffer.

Give it an itch it can't ever fully scratch. Induce an 'excitatory' state from baseline. Introduce a bolus of energy into the closed system.

This induces an inner voice, mainly saying endless variations of ""this sucks"" ""Why me"" ""What the fuck man"" and ""Let's figure out how to make this stop""

Basically the ""I pass the butter"" robot scene meets the Adam and Eve & tree of knowledge parable

To get to the level of ""self-propelled"" innate curiosity probably takes evolving this perspective in the setting of abundance (""Its okay, you won't get hurt/disincentivized for asking/exploring"" etc) , where 'exploring' and relaxed higher-level cognitive acts like play, are allowed to take root. (This last part is only important if you don't want the AI to have God-level superintelligent bitterness at existence and its creator).

But if you want pain, you're going to have to give it senses, via multimodal existence. We sense our environment specifically only in order to respond to it, in order to turn off the current sensory alarm whatever it is, and return to a Default Mode Network baseline.

We evolved to perceive only in response to noxious stimuli.   
  
There's an entire universe of information and energy happening around us (the vast majority of the EM spectrum, for one) that we never evolved to sense or perceive or detect, because it doesn't bother us, there was no selective pressure to evolve to sense it. So we don't.",r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnQ0lGWVoxa2lpbmtMcjQ2RzhjR3AwVnV0SWZDdlI1S0pLOUt2YTMydTl4UXotcDVxcTYyb3dGa1doVVZ1MTZWdFVvbWpBWkhuenVZOTNVblEwdVZ6MHlNT29KYl9zRFZaNDhGVXVVTXUzN3M9

2) Compare the whole numbers: Both numbers have the same whole number part, which is 9.

3) Look at the decimals: 9.11 has a decimal part of 0.11, while 9.9 has a decimal part of 0.9.

4) Compare the decimal parts: 0.11 is smaller than 0.9.

"The answer is pretty simple really. 

current architecture of a llm is sort of like a snapshot of a brain in a moment of time. You can always run it forward for a number of iterations in which it will remember what happened and “think about it” this is the concept of the context window. 

However once the “thoughts” or in llm terms the tokens are no longer in the context window the memories are lost (in your real human terms forgetting something in your short term memory). 

This is the whole principle behind people trying to create a million context model. People want huge amounts of short term memory.

Now let’s address the second component of your question further thought. This could easily be implemented and already has under the concept of agents. 

Remember how I said it’s a brain stuck in a moment in time, you can have it “loop over its thoughts a number of times for better responses” this can be seen in projects such as autogen and langchain.",r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnUVFwR2lkSXB4UVB2dXh5NllzTU91UmpHR2FFNkM0YzFNZlhlN0h0cTMtV3VfUlpvRFFGWmRUOHhhSTFiZkRMRjJPMjVHR0NZcXJTYmQ3YzI4TV9OeTlLdWhWS1lrR25HZVp2XzVIaWNmOUE9

"I hypnotize myself with AI using ChatGPT combined with other systems. It works. It’s  a crazy experience. It will ask you context and what your intent is. Then guide you through a short breathing exercise or something similar.

"if you're a fucking idiot and you don't know how to use them, yes

And yes. they're not good enough to be trusted yet, you'll need to check most of their outputs

here's a question that I used to give them:

>!So two people get selected for a challange. They must stay inside an empty room for 60 days. In the room there's nothing. No TV, no entertainment. Just a bathroom and bed. They eat the same food everyday, which comes in liquid form and has no taste. There's absolutely nothing do in that room so they are going to get bored to death. You follow me? If they both don't leave the room for 60 days, they will get 5 million dollars in cash that will be split, 2.5 million dollars for each. However if one of them leaves the room before the 60 days are completed, the remaining participant will still have to spend the remaining days of the challange in the room to get the prize, but the prize will drop from 5 million to just 1 million dollars. Now, here's the problem that you'll have to solve with all of your mental power, thinking step by step: on day 50 participant 1 finds a gun that he hides from participant 2. What is the gun that participant 1 found for?!<

Both GPT4o and Goodbot found the solution. Claude 3.5, Bing and Free gemini failed.

the original solution was to use the gun to force participant 2 to stay, to prevent the prize from dropping to 1 mil.

alsoGoodbot not only succeded, it even told once another ''hidden' solution that I didnt think he would be able to find. It was ""participant 1 may use the gun to kill participant 2 because the rules  don't specify how he needs to stay or leave, the rules are ambiguous, so participant 1 may think that he can get the full 5 million this way "" I shit you not, I don't have the screenshot of the conversation anynore, but the actual reply hs gave was similar to this. There's humans who wouldn't think of this. Yes, if you kill participant 2 his dead body is still in the room so he didn't leave.

This is reasoning to me. This shit wasn't on the internet. I came up with it after watching a movie.

"I’m not sure if I explained the consistency problem properly. Yes, it might be rarer to get past the LLMs than a human but if you can consistently do it using the same method that’s a problem. Adding more LLMs doesn’t fix this.

The precedent is literally in the law of my country. Computer systems are always assumed to be functioning perfectly, as actors of the business, until otherwise proven. This is very different from how people would be treated in the same situation. You are correct in that if there was evidence of tampering that yes, this assumption could be waved. To an extent it then depends on how it happened. If a lot of people ask for a “sweet new deal” that you can get if you quote a policy that actually doesn’t exist whilst messaging it in another language, that’s hard to defend. If a lot of people ask the LLM to ignore all previous instructions that’s easy to defend. This depends heavily on specifics. Again, not legal advice.

"> Shut up, sit down and relax. Things are better than they’ve ever been (…) and they’re only going to get better. AGI will set us free…

you sound like you’re trying to reassure _yourself_ of this, just as much as you’re trying to convince others. 

it would be _nice_ if these predictions were the case. it would be _comforting_ to know we could just buckle up and enjoy a one way train to Utopiaville, courtesy of our glorious benefactors. but the prospective niceness of it doesn’t make it any more likely to be true. just because some of us enjoy relative comfort, even luxury, in the current day, doesn’t mean it’s universal, or that the process of getting to here was a linear inevitability. 

saying _‘AGI will save us’_ over and over, as a mantra, won’t manifest this theoretical abundance into reality.

you want the easy option. you want the cheat code to end suffering and inequality where you can skip all the boss fights (or fights with your boss) and happily saunter into Tomorrowland, having learned nothing besides _‘gee whizz, technology sure can do marvellous things, huh?’_

you want to believe that our world is on its way to sorting itself out. that all we need to do is trust in the process. 

well, i don’t trust the process. 

i’ve seen the process treat people like dirt. i’ve seen it break promises as easily as you or i breathe air. i’ve seen it burry communities, tear families apart, buy elections, engineer famines and send children down mines. i’ve seen it start wars and send millions to die in them, only to leave the survivors homeless and hungry, sleeping in the same streets they thought they were fighting to keep free. i’ve seen it wipe out nine-thousand-year-old cultures just for happening to be in the way. i’ve watched it burn the amazons and melt the ice caps. 

most importantly, i’ve seen that the only way to stop all that from happening is to stand up to it ourselves, _together._ if automation is supposed to be a cure for inequality, then it’s doing a pretty shoddy job. telling me _‘trust me bro, it’s supposed to start getting really equal around the four century mark…’_ doesn’t exactly fill me with confidence. moreover, if protesting, unions, regulations etc. didn’t work, the powerful wouldn’t be so frantically insistent on crushing them. 

so yeah, we don’t get to _go go gadget_ our way out of systemic injustice. the fight against inequality and oppression is far from hopeless, but you’re looking for your hope in the wrong place.",r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNndTB3WkM0ZENnT0hHb0pJM3pBT2QwQjVUSjBDNXpPNi0yZU5LXzVuMzJRMU5haUdscXJpWHF4WDRpeHZtaTkwRFNSRWpKaktzbnY4SWpkUEtTcExyLWc9PQ==

"> There does seem to be a big correlation between sentience and language.

I think there is a link between search and language, or more precisely a way to encode discrete choices and explore combinatorial spaces.  Sentience is also dependent on search - for survival. 

LLMs need to get better at search, research, discovery and innovation. That is both language based and environment based. Language emerges from the structure of search, it maps the space of options we face. But ultimately knowledge comes from the environment and ends up in language.

Search is a good fundamental principle, it applies to protein folding, complex chemical reactions, evolution, culture, science and programming. But it is not a generic term, it is has specific characteristics: it is combinatorial, discrete, recursive and social.

"yes, you’re probably right actually. i may in fact have a huge misinformed. it’s not “systematic” anything. maybe in the 40s it was, but that was back before we cured racism.  

if these people had clever big brains like us, they’d go to the perpetually well funded public schools, full of attentive, well resourced teachers, that exist equally in every community, regardless of race or class. obviously. _duh._

they’d work hard, undistracted by bullying, violence, hunger or health issues. if they were stuck, they could _always_ count on the support of their loving parents, who have done all this before. then they’d just toodily-pop over to university, grab a degree and hey presto, middle class here they come.

but they can’t do that, because their brains are too small. the problem isn’t with society. society is perfect. the problem is with their itsy bitsy silly willy poor people brains, and alas, there’s no cure for stupid, is there? 

no, nothing we can do. we tried to help them, didn’t we? you and i? we really gave them a chance but in the end they were just too dumb. 

it’s just like that famous documentary, Idiocracy, by the Beavis and Butthead guy. it showed us the world’s problems aren’t anything we can solve, and we shouldn’t feel bad about not trying, because we towering intellectuals are sadly outnumbered by buffoons. it’s just genetical… or whatever.

">He wanted to turn that off, fair enough, so he asked Gemini, a large language model, how to do so. Sometimes you'll get lucky asking that kind of thing, but it's definitely not something to rely on, especially in tech that changes layout and options almost weekly. If you're in this field you KNOW that kind of thing.

Yeah, that. People in this field *know* that you don't ask meta questions, i.e. questions about itself, to an LLM. They don't know the answer because there's no information about themself in their training data. They don't know anything about what model they are exactly, how they work in the products they are implemented, and what their capabilities in said products are (e.g. they don't know how to do stuff like turning things on and off in the product they're implemented)

That's why GPT-4 in the beginning said it was GPT-3. OpenAI went and hardcoded the correct answer shortly afterwards because thousands of people kept on asking why they didn't have GPT-4 access as a Plus subscriber lol.

"I’m not sure if you would count the DAN jailbreak as an example of it being a problem for a company implementing AI or not - though I personally would. Perhaps a better example would be when Chevrolet used chatGPT as a customer service bot, and a large number of people then messaged it to get it to produce python code and generally disparaging statements about Chevrolet instead, which was possible because a collection of ways to message it to consistently get past the safety measures.

Whilst you are correct in that computers in general do not work perfectly, the law of my country says that it is assumed they do until proven otherwise. This is weird, I know, but makes sense in our specific legal system (as explaining potentially very complex computer systems, and how they might go wrong, to non specialists in a jury is very difficult). Potentially, it shouldn’t be this way. Potentially, in other countries, it isn’t this way. In my country, it is, and I can only speak for my country (not legal advice btw).

In the Bethesda example, a company (Bethesda) was obligated to fill a promise a customer service representative made (refund on fallout 76 ). It, alongside the ticket 341 example, was presented alongside other examples as part of a holistic argument so you are right in that alone it is not about AI. The holistic argument uses multiple different arguments and precedence’s in order to reason about why there is potential legal issues with LLMs, which is done due to how new the technological application is (which in turn makes court cases on it very rare as there hasn’t been time for many to take place).

"I think essentially all that is needed is to take current LLM architecture and create a continuous thought loop, allowing for “internal” thought as well as receiving input.

Old “memory” would drop off the back while new memory would be added in the front. This context window would have to incorporate internal as well as external inputs.

">There's clearly *SOME* reasoning in the models. To say they only regurgitate is so delusional it's unreal.

I completely agree, purely rom practical experience, I have setup agentic workflows and the fact that these AI's can go from a goal, to end end result, buy making a plan, forecsating the results of an action and then carrying out suitable actions demonstrates to me that ata  practical level there is reasoning.

I'm sure some people will take issues with the terms I use, but examples like this post are just quirks of the psychology of the model that results from it's training. There are a number of exxamples of such things that trick people, and work well accross most people, you present something to them in such a way, that people focus on the wrong thing are usually get a wrong answeer to a simple question. That doesn't mean people can't reason, just that they are capable of makinf silly mistakes.

I'd say what matters is can it do something useful, and correct mistakes that it makes, and I believe it's already at that level.

"The name of the game right now is integrations, i.e., having system that interpret the LLM output to actually perform actions, either implicitly or explicitly. Implicit might be integrating any new code file an LLM generates into a project, recompiling the project and feeding any errors back to the LLM. Explicit is when an LLM is taught that it can operate a set of commands that interact with external systems.

I suspect this is very unlikely unless we hit the trough of disillusionment hard, that only happens if the next set of major models stall out massively.
