"As with anything, it depends.  If you are one year unaccompanied then you will probably live on base, unless there is no room.  The amount of room on base has a lot to do with your rank.  For example, there is probably less CGO dorm space than NCO dorm space.  

You can apply for command sponsorship which allows you to bring your car, live off base, have a place for kids in school, etc.  iIf you go this route, you are signing up for two years minimum, unaccompanied or accompanied.

You can also KAIP, which provides a financial incentive to stay an extra year, in accompanied or unaccompanied, but KAIP’ing by itself won’t allow for you to live off base.

My understanding is that SPACEFOR-KOREA has some command sponsor billets, so I would reach out to them soonest to secure one of those.  This is the only guaranteed way to bring your family and live off base.  There are apartments on base, but those are normally in high demand for families who have kids in school and want easy access to on base school facilities.  If you are command sponsored want to live off base, that should be relatively easy.

"IAW DAFI 36-2502, Table 1.3, item 3 (pg19), 

Promotion will be withheld if you fail. That does not mean your line number will be cancelled. 

If you fail, then pass your retest, line number is reinstated (as long as you pass before the last line number promotes).

Your Commander has authority under DAFMAN 36-2905 to redline your stripe after one failure; most commanders will 100% redline after consecutive failures. It really depends on the other factors. If you show you’re willing to put in the work and pass your retest, it will look favorably to not redline your stripe. 

Recommend talking to your GRT (assuming you’re at a base that has one) to get a workout plan, then follow it. Talk with your SEL and make sure your command team knows you’re in trouble but already taking steps to get ahead of it. Being proactive (albeit late) before a failure looks sooooo much better than after a failure.

"I see where the OP is stating they don't necessarily want to talk to anyone. they just want the meds. I very recently dealt with some frustrations with the mental health situation. I tried to do things the ""right"" way since in the past couple of years I've seen an increase in encouragement for using mental health resources. 

However, the process was the biggest pain in the ass. Here are the steps I took (the long route):

1. walked into MH office. they asked the mandatory questions. I responded ""no"" to all of them. They told me to kick rocks and talk to BHOP since I wasn't planning to hurt myself or others.

2. called to schedule appointment. Had to wait months before being seen.

3. went to BHOP appointment. Dude told me to practice my breathing during times of stress. yes...breathing.

4. came back about 2 months later for the follow up appointment, where I explained the breathing was a waste of my time. Then he hold me to find other ways to relieve stress such as exercising.. (I've always gone to the gym nearly everyday, so it's not like that was gonna suddenly fix me)

5. called MilOneSource to find a therapist in the area. I had my appointment with the therapist later that month. it was super helpful actually. doc said he recommends medication and would start the referral process. PERFECT!

6. called the Med group a week later to see what the deal was. they explained it doesn't work like that. MilOneSource cannot refer meds.. fml

7. scheduled appointment with my PCM and explained what steps I'd taken up to this point and explained I just want some medication. he immediately said, ""I can get you on some meds. do you have a particular drug in mind?""

wtf?! I went through all these hoops just to realize I just had to ask my doc for meds... it's likely he was only so ready to prescribe meds because I exhausted the other resources. However, he didn't even ask about the other steps. Just said ""yepp, I got you.. let's get you on Sertraline (Zoloft).""

all that to say, I got my meds now. been on em for about a month now. best thing ever!!! I feel so normal, so level headed!

shoot me a message if you want any details. 

DISCLAIMER: Meds won't fix everything. It often takes people a while to find the perfect dose of the right drug. Definitely take that step to talk to someone in confidence, like the MilOneSource recommended Therapists. The doc I spoke with was a civilian in the local area. Not connected to the military at all. I never even met him. Just spoke over the phone to help me organize my thoughts. As a skeptic, I was surprised how helpful it was. Take that step first to figure out ways to straighten out the chaos in your head BEFORE reaching for meds.",r/spaceforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYYlZFUk1pdHdZZ2syck12YnJDY0FhOWpEd3lFenlZeDFTVXlDaWhTcnJRdkJNcnlWZVU4Q20zcXpWdk9SZXhwTGFZNjVEUnNBMXl2dnpJS01ndEhGeENnX2ZUV251a3RiaV9OcElZTVo5Umc9

If you want to boost your resume for civilian jobs especially those outside of the cleared spaces then I highly recommend applying for SupraCoders or a program like DAF AI Accelerator (Phantoms).,r/spaceforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhNXBNZElQMmo2VXFjV0ZLVGZjUnpBakFlVkVMVFZDSkE5NFBMZjNaX19OSHhMaDNDMjBFcDVESFp4aWg2a1MwckJuWGV1U3VOM2pyU1EycWwzSHp6UEE9PQ==
"Can confirm. I've definitely personally experienced being part of an org that, despite innovating to deliver successful products directly and continuously to operators, was being stripped for parts to fund less-successful programs that still haven't delivered well beyond their original schedule and cost.

Never mind that we were doing things in a fresh, innovative (for the military) way, being more efficient and effective with our resources, and delivering actual results to our users. *Obviously* we don't want to replicate that kind of success elsewhere /s",r/spaceforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhZlFUODl2YXV5TXZoanQ2RzRaNUp6UVoxbUVfRjBoZHVUNTg1RGJ3bUw3X0x6dnVjVEpyQm5lQ2JaUXRVLUtVNHkzVTBhSXl3SG9uWUFJOTNEOEozWElSVGM1cFdFR1lLNFpJd01CNVVZNlU9

"I will be graduating with a B.S. IT degree and will have some compTIA certs including the sec+, some AWS and azure certs, and a few other random IT certs. And I’m sure I could ace the asvab after some study.

I’m only interested in going in for an enlisted IT/cyber job and I am not too picky as long it’s an actual IT job.

People would probably call me dumb for not wanting to send a packet in for becoming an officer, but I seriously am completely uninterested in doing management and administrative stuff. I just want to do computer nerd shit and gain as many skills that I can while being apart of something that I think is meaningful. (I really don’t care about the money, but if I was planning on having a long career I might be more interested in being an officer).

People can try to tell me that this is a dumb decision to make, but I’m really stubborn, and once I decide I want to go for something, I do it and I don’t look back. I think for my professional IT career, this will benefit me greatly. The space force is something I really want to go for, and I’ll be willing to wait a whole year to make it happen.

I want to make it as easy as I can for the recruiter. I’ll already have a qualifying asvab score, physically and mentally fit, no medical issues, and I will really try to just have all my ducks in a row and generally be good to go.

I want to hit the ground running, any advice?",r/spaceforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhV1dWM29RbXQ2VlYxcmZBRFhkcEVyM2RCcy1kdjY2My1wdlJKSDZTV0hNNnZsWTNqcEQzLXBvdUlSUEtDWlNuZ2dMYkItaktfZ0gteGFHUWUybWpvUFFzdldWdlNyck01U01iVzFVdWdWVG89

"You can go through the process of enlistment and wait in the Delayed Entry Program (DEP) for a Space Force job.

"Hello, I have just been given the news within the past week that I have been accepted into the USSF and have been given the job Space System Operations, and I'll be shipping out in a little over a month. I was a little disappointed at first as I really wanted to do something within the Cyber field, but as far as I can gather Space Systems seems pretty expansive and neat in it's own right (I read through the Air Force's ""Reddit Wiki thing"" on 1C6X1 / 5S1X1 as well as some other sources).

I wanted to ask if anyone has experience within the Space Systems field and what they can tell me. What should I expect? How do you like it?

Secondarily, I heard about a ""Supra Coders"" program and was thinking about applying for it once I'm in. Is it a good way to pursue coding outside of a Cyber job?

"For you SFSC it may be more difficult to be admitted to supra coders. But if you have the support of your unit and great interest you can definitely get in. Also, you likely will not be doing much coding in space systems. Likelihood is you will have to re-class. But I would remain optimistic because space operations can be a great time! Then you can focus on your interest to code outside of work. :) In a year or so when you're settled into your unit ping me on pm and I can send you more info to join supra coders.",r/spaceforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNncFpranYwSGJ5a09RY3puWDJ3WVJXRFhFRE5qQ0RFMU94NThkLXZrNW1WbXZfQ24wek5BRGd5WmZqNEdzekhYOTJEek0tYVZ2X3E1ZFlzMWNibHlyVDF1NFJnclg0cU1iT09QdkZuRF9Ia0k9
