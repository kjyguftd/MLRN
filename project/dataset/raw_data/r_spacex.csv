> In the hours after an anomaly like this the following things happen (not in order):
> 1) Start assembling a fishbone diagram and methodically log pieces of evidence (incriminating or exonerating) against it.  You want to eventually find the proximate engineering cause as well as root cause
> 2) Nail down a complete and accurate timeline of events down to milliseconds and sync all data sources you have against that “truth” timeline
> 3) Review witness statements
> 4) Data mine ATP and QTP data and review work orders, issue tickets, change tickets and risk tickets

> SpaceX moves incredibly fast along all of these avenues and more, with as many resources as needed

So the worry might only affect their new configs, or might be something they already know was specific to a change they made, and not something that would have any bearing on crew dragons locked configuration (side for business as usual).

">> I think Paul's point is that's an engine RUD, not a RUD of the entire stage

This.

> *u/fzz67:*  if a turbopump turbine lets go, you'll get parts travelling rapidly. It looks like the merlin turbopump is mounted with the shaft along the long axis of the stage, which would reduce the chances of shrapnel holing the tanks and causing a complete RUD,

On at least one occasion, a turbine blade killed an airline passenger. In contrast, rocket turbine blades are said to be smaller and easier to protect against. On first stages at least, this eventuality is planned for so why not the second? 

As for holing a tank, what more could happen than either fuel or oxygen spurting out into vacuum?

"I agree that simply holing the tank isn't likely to cause an explosion while in space - it's just too hard to get a combustable mix at sufficient pressure.  But that's not the only way for a rocket to explode.  SpaceX's two explosive failures so far didn't involve fuel/oxygen explosions.  Amos 6 involved oxygen and the carbon in a COPV, and CRS 7 was simply a burst helium cylinder due to a strut failing.  I've no idea what happens if a hot fragment hits a COPV, but if you rupture a high pressure helium cylinder, you would likely have an explosive RUD that scatters a fair amount of debris.  I would hope that they position such explosion risks to minimize the chances of damage from a failing engine, but optimizing for *how* your second stage fails is probably not at the top of the performance optimization list.

As for Apollo 13, the main debris was the entire 10 foot long bay door, fragments of the oxygen tank itself, and some insulation.  Not insignificant, but certainly not as bad as some debris events we've seen.

"As much as I like Dreamchaser more on paper as a vehicle than Starliner (I appreciate the added functionality), Sierra Nevada / Sierra Space Corporation have *not* been doing a better job than Boeing in terms of reliably delivering their vehicle on time.

This is a vehicle that first entered development all the way back in 2004 by SpaceDev before being acquired by Sierra Nevada in 2008, and was rejected in 2014 from being selected for commercial crew after receiving ~$230M of development funding to prove the vehicle's case:

> In the selection statement, Bill Gerstenmaier, head of NASA's human exploration and operations directorate, explained the decision by stating that ""a winged spacecraft is a more complex design and thus entails more developmental and certification challenges, and therefore **may have more technical and schedule risk than expected**"", and ""I consider **SNC's design to be at the lowest level of maturity, with significantly more technical work and critical design decisions to accomplish.... SNC's proposal also has more schedule uncertainty**.""

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Nevada_Corporation

However that didn't stop Dreamchaser from still being selected in 2016 for a cargo version under CRS-2 as a third supplier: 



> A second phase of contracts (known as CRS-2) was solicited in 2014. In 2015, NASA extended CRS-1 to twenty flights for SpaceX and twelve flights for Orbital ATK[note 1].[4][5] **CRS-2 contracts were awarded in January 2016** to Orbital ATK[note 1] Cygnus, **Sierra Nevada Corporation Dream Chaser**, and SpaceX Dragon 2, for cargo transport flights beginning in 2019 and **expected to last through 2024**. 

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Resupply_Services

Meanwhile:

> SSC Demo-1, also known as Dream Chaser Demo-1, is the planned first flight of the Sierra Space robotic resupply spacecraft Dream Chaser to the International Space Station (ISS) under the CRS-2 contract with NASA. **The demonstration mission is planned for launch no earlier than 2025.**[2][4] 

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSC_Demo-1

At this rate, cargo Dreamchaser is quite literally going to be scrambling just to complete the minimum six contracted cargo missions before 2030, when the ISS is currently scheduled to be deorbited ... and it's not even a crewed vehicle.

"> the FAA only regulates effects on the ground and atmosphere - it has no jurisdiction in space.

If so, then under FAA rules, SpaceX could have programmed IFT-4 to fly  up to a low Earth orbit.

"Not only new flaps but they are also further leeward as has been anticipated for some time for Block 2 ships. The aerocovers are also much smaller.

The tiles on the tip of the nosecone also extend quite a bit further down on the leeward side and, overall, the tile layout is different to the Block 1 nosecones.

The Block 2 nosecone also has what looks to be three small lifting hooks that are very close to top of the nosecone tip (these are also much smaller than the hooks we've seen on Block 1 ships). They will have been used during the nosecone assembly and presumably now only be used for stacking the nosecone onto the payload bay until the two point lifter can be used as the ship stack (and hence the weight) increases too much.

The steel looks a lot nicer too.

"I was thinking, and it might be silly or easily disproven, and I'm not at all married to this idea, but throwing it out there if I may: Could Block 2 =/= V2?

So we have the naming inconsistency, which SpaceX does a lot, but they come out with the stretched vehicles as V2 and V3 in the presentation, and then we see actual hardware rolling out as Block 2. So far so good, if confusing.

But then on the latest EDA tour, Tim asks Elon directly about the future ships, when we might see those and all, and he was kinda cagey and kinda swept it off, and the way he specifically mentioned ""stretched ships"" as a down the line thing seemed odd if V2 as we understand it was indeed being built as they spoke (and saw like 15 minutes later, I'm assuming, this very nosecone). Then again, to be fair, it could just have been a matter of: Flight 4 tomorrow, not relevant now, anything else is forever away, focus Tim.

Then there's B15, seemingly so far still a Block 1 and from the math of it, supposedly intended to launch S33 (this new one). Raptor 3, if we're counting them as necessary for the V2s, still appears to be a while away, in the testing phase. I mean it'll take a while too to stack and fit out S33, and otherwise work up to actually needing it (flying the remaining Block 1 ships, though S32 could be skipped), so maybe the first R3s arriving ends up lining up with S33 being ready for them, but still.

Anyway, my point is: Could Block 2 be sort of a subdivision of V1, where what we saw so far was, let's say, V1 Block 1, and now V1 Block 2 introduces the new flaps, tile patterns, etc etc. but they're still the same size, same engines, able to launch on a Block 1 booster, so they can keep iterating and verifying until R3 is flight-ready. And then V2 proper is when they do the stretch, and introduce Raptor 3 and whatever else.

Of course, one easy way for this to fall apart is if they roll out the tank sections and they are indeed stretched, but so far I'm not aware of that being possible to know yet. Most likely I'm overthinking it.",r/spacex,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaM2tkQTJhYmpfdUxWQXh3V0xJYXRjV2RpT1NxWDVCWVBQVHVpMlg1Q2FYSmhldTE4eEZMOVpHMTcwT2RkOXM2LVVvWExwM2w1YTl5TnVwRUtZZ3JDbHc9PQ==
"The thing is the cowbell seems to be over the LOX header tank but not at its top which makes it an odd location for a vent.  

So what if the LOX header tank is also a cryogenic cooler for the nose during entry?  That way heat soaking through the TPS from the hottest part of the hull is carried away by the LOX heating up and then boiling.  

Boiling LOX would create oxygen gas that needs to be vented and during entry the cowbell is on the top of the tank.",r/spacex,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRWN2RG9rTFVNbWxyVVNMa2VhaVZMSll1SmpGWHpVdTN6bm1iOUxjSVFpT01Kc3NRZjBBcVJNeTVUeGtlM0pjR2dZc0pyUExsang4MVUySDBhemJOVXc9PQ==

"Well you are right that it looks like the first Block 2 ship S33 will launch on a Block 1 design booster B15.  

The reason of course is that the Block 2 booster upgrades do not add much to the performance with a very modest tank stretch but would still require changes to the ship QD.  

In addition if they are just starting the testing of Raptor 3 engines they are going to be short of engines for a while so it makes sense to put six new engines on the ship rather than try to put 33 Raptor 3 engines on the booster.  

I also think HLS is going to be based on Starship Block 2 so it makes sense to get qualification of that design as quickly as possible.  

Starship just adds 1 ring of 1.83m to the overall length of Block 1 so it would be super easy to add to the design so I suspect they will make all the major Block 2 changes to the ship together.",r/spacex,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZkFkR1hsdXE1MUg5cWJUdzBHZVdhUEp5QTd6aUtFR3NFYnZpcDBCSzFYZEZ0dHRjdUFWTW9tNmVrUHh5RC1TMC1YMU9VQWdGSjFDMkw5MVZMbXpFY0E9PQ==

"I don't agree. The leak was there, but the engine was working well. Letting the stage get to orbit, as close to planned as possible, would have been the safest. Then you can re-enter where you want when you want, with the recovery crew on hand, instead of having to scramble them to the middle of the ocean.

An engine fault that would damage the capsule, 14 meters and several layers of aluminium away, would be highly unlikely.

"Just after the loss of mission, Elon tweeted that the engine experienced a 'RUD' on second stage restart. It is possible that it was merely a failure to restart. At most, a loss of the turbopump rotor on propellant exhaustion.

"The base equation is the same, as noted in equation 1 (note they define Cd as the ballistic coefficient, commonly denoted as beta, so to account for this there’s an additional mass term multiplied in). So the primary uncertainty is determine a) what cd to use and b) what density to use. The article you linked does detail a lot of the possible methods for calculating this, but also admits that no method is perfect. 

However, I would bet significant money that you can reasonably use the Cd of a flat plate and the density at the altitude from 1979 US Standard Atmosphere model and get an answer within an order of magnitude. 

I’m not saying it will be 100% accurate, but it’s an easy enough Fermi approximation

"I have a vague memory of Elon in some interview claiming that he pushed for more-pointy than the aero team wanted, because he felt rockets should be pointy. However this is 1) a very vague memory so almost certainly wrong in critical ways and 2) could have just been him trying to be funny or similar even if I didn't misremember. So, there is a possibility that it's not purely aerodynamics based shaping but partially aesthetic - or I may be wrong. Hopefully someone here either remembers the interview and can clarify what it actually said or nobody at all remembers it and thus it can be written off as a weird fever dream of mine.

Edit: Googling would have been faster than me writing that rambling post - seems it was with Rogan interview 3.

I get catching the booster but it seems odd to catch starship.  They should just land it like they do the booster from falcon 9.  It's a large enough diameter to not require legs and they've proven they can set it down already.

">Could Block 2 be sort of a subdivision of V1, where what we saw so far was, let's say, V1 Block 1, and now V1 Block 2 introduces the new flaps, tile patterns, etc etc. but they're still the same size, same engines, able to launch on a Block 1 booster, so they can keep iterating and verifying until R3 is flight-ready. And then V2 proper is when they do the stretch, and introduce Raptor 3 and whatever else.

I think there's a good reason to move to the V2 asap, which is that for RTLS operations they would want to have a stable design that has re-entered soft-landed numerous times. Similarly, they'll try to get to Raptor 3 asap because they want the relight behaviour dialled in.",r/spacex,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaalNtcnZtMkRNd0Zia2ZrS0VPOVNMOE1LTFpQdGZ1VUtqYmpwOVdLbUZuYXRFUm5qYTZ0UGxQeThud0VteVZuM1I0MTN4OFNGS1A4dmNYYlZPYUdrQmc9PQ==
"More like 99%. It's probably the coast that killed it, as it was leaking lox at a slow rate and that has more time to add up after 45min of coasting than it does during the initial burn to orbit. Restarting an engine with minimal propellant reserves is also a dangerous moment.

The circularisation and deorbit burns are only a couple of seconds.

Starlink launches use the most efficient trajectory to orbit, so when they get there they are at something like 135x400km and SECO happens at the 135km bit. They coast around to apogee and burn momentarily to circularise that.

It would be possible for them to launch directly into a safer orbit e.g. 250x250km with no coast or engine relight. That's obviously less technically risky, but would significant reduce the payload capacity. Their current trajectory accepts that extra risk to get the extra satellite or two but if and when the relight after half-orbit coast fails, the whole launch is lost.

Given that they launched like 170 times before that happened once, it was probably the right bet - getting a couple of extra satellites up 170 times, but losing 20 of them once. The optics are not great though to people who haven't done the math.",r/spacex,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaelNrNHhRZ2FXdGRMemVyX3U3THp3ZUppWXA4UTRLMUdlZGFFZTJTMm1CZmFic3VDU290OEJyQlhhUkdWUFlQNy1XOEpvNWxHY1huVXJYVE15ZUZUQmc9PQ==
