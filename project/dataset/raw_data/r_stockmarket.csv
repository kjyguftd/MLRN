Don't gamble with borrowed money. I thought that was pretty obvious,r/stockmarket,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYQ1ExamQtbUFPZGFBc240Z3dWaEh1cnJSTE80Wk1vdlFpMzBXYjJ3bjREMTIyOHpucUllbEdFdmlJZl9XS2h1RVVkTmR3QmtoY0RHNXNDOEdIMEdGZUE9PQ==
"You need to do an imaginary conversion of everything to units of utils (utility). With the same natural resources, todays economy is outputting much more utility than the economies of yesteryear - (travel is safer and more accessible, houses are nicer and safer, the stuff you buy for yourself is more capable or cheaper (in a relative sense, real $/util) than it used to be) that's the effect of ""growth"". The actual value of things made by the economy has increased, and that underpins the increase in the cost of stocks. When you normalize for inflation and population size, you get pretty close to the actual increase in total utility. 

That can go on seemingly forever as long as humans continue to innovate. If we eventually hit some hard stop in our ability to make things better.....then everything becomes a zero-sum game and we'll need to adopt a different economic system.",r/stockmarket,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYMGRBWFdvc3ljRG1yeHFkN1ZIcHgzN09QdW9CWHZMMUFQNV92ZkNBblhoMm5qb19uS0tZcUpuT21MemFFU05yTnhvM2phVmVDZnZVaVlyQndYSTVhWFE9PQ==

"As a hobbyist who's just started in this domain and shopping around for quality datasets for research, I wanted to clarify regarding the data bundle you linked:

- Assuming I were to subscribe for only a month for the purposes of research, I could technically just download the bundle of data locally and unsubscribe, essentially having all data (including historical) as part of the bundle up to the point I unsubscribe right?

  
Also, loved the work you've put into this, it was an interesting read (coming from Quantopian and going through your shared deck) which I plan on replicating in local markets although I don't imagine I could be filtering in terms of mega and large cap companies as its still an emerging market. 

  
If you do consider sharing the code, I'd love to have a look to understand and learn your intuition when it comes to creating these trading rules. Your write-up does great at explaining it in depth but I'd also be glad to know how you come to carrying out the statistical distributions of this strat and visualising the distributions (to highlight differences in the tails for IPOs vs. non IPOs).

"China does not allow foreigners to invest in their companies.

 What they have done is look the other way as their companies set up offshore shell companies. Foreigners buy stock in those shell companies. That allows Chinese companies to raise capital and in return  agree to provide those shell companies a share of their profits. The Chinese government can shut down those arrangements at any time. 

I have every reason to believe that once  China has enough wealth to fund the capitalization needs of their companies internally, those shell companies will be shut down and the  investors will be left with nothing. The reason this has not yet happened is that I  suspect the Chinese government knows this will be a decision from which there will be no turning back.

"So here's the advice I'd give if I could go back and talk to my 18 year old self. First, are you sure you won't need that money anytime soon and are okay with potentially losing some in the short term? If you are, then great, you can invest it. Stick with ETFs for now, whichever you'd like although VOO is understandably pretty popular here. Set your account to reinvest dividends and invest more whenever you have more disposable income.  

Now what do you do? Go learn. You're 18, you don't know anything yet. And that's not an attack. Maybe you're brilliant. But there's a lot to be said for experience. Warren Buffett didn't magically pop out ready to be Warren Buffett. People love talking about how early he started, but he grew up in a household where his father owned a brokerage firm and he studied for years under Benjamin Graham; there was a lot of instruction, education, and experience that went into that success. So go read up on Bogleheads like someone else suggested and see if you still think stock picking is worth the effort. Learn how to research and value a company. Paper trade to test what you've learned. Emotion can be a killer in trading so pay attention to how you feel with your paper trading (not perfect because it always feels stronger when it's real, but if you're feeling FOMO/greed know that that can make you jump into a trade too early, or if you're getting too upset about losses you could abandon a good trade too early). Watch the market and companies on your watch list for a while to see what impact different macro and micro events have on their performance. Read about different strategies people employ, not to try to copy directly, but to see if there are elements you'd want to incorporate in your own trading.

"The economy is a big money recycling machine. When you buy a stock (applicable to anything, but we'll stick with stocks), the money goes either to the seller who then does something else with it. If the seller is a company, for example, they use that money to buy stuff that will expand the business, more jobs, more jobs for business they buy stuff from, etc. At some point, the money turns into pay to consumers, some of which will go into investments, and the wheel keeps turning. Without printing more money, you can have more money available to pay more expensive prices for things like stocks by the money machine just moving faster - or put another way: growth.

">but surely an 18 year old can find stocks willing to reinvest in themselves rather than just paying out investors because they don't have any better options.

That’s a wrong understanding of dividends. It’s not like companies stop investing in research & development once they pay dividends. All of the major cloud hosters increased their cap ex spending but still pay a dividend (except from Amazon). At some point a company can make so much money that there is no way to smartly invest it so they return it to shareholders through dividends.",r/stockmarket,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZUkMyWnoxS0dqYjBxWE1mSXNYVTB6OHFOWGhndVRKQmg5MlRYWEk3WlJBdUhBOFVaQktvdzA2MFR6QU4xaFl2RUhrY0RIRF9ySFNuempPYUJCLTVqa1E9PQ==

"You obviously do not get it so let me make this simple for you. 

You invest in stock A, stock A pays a dividend of 2% a year  and has an annual increase of say 3% 

Stock b the s&p500 increases on average 10% a year 

You buy 1 stock A for 100£
You buy 1 stock B for 100£ 
Both for 10 years 

At the end of the 10 years,stock
A is worth 134£
stock b is worth 270£ 

Stock A is paying you a dividend of 2% or £2.68 a year...
Now you could sell stock b and buy stock A with it meaning you have almost 2 shares meaning you have double the dividend pay out.  Even if you invested the small dividends you had along the 10 years it wouldn't change much. 

All this assuming the dividend pay out stays the same, 2% is generous with a 3 % annualised growth on top and it's still far far worse over just over 10 years, do it over 30 and it's no where close. 

Please stop shilling these to new people.",r/stockmarket,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZVS0zdkxyMVhfQmhhQ3k4UlBKUldvLVMwYm1GQ21ZcmxYZ1p6bWJ0UWRHZ0hLTmxPcTZncjc1SkpsY3JRbjBSallubVZJMEdzN2l1aHdEXzdGNFM1bFE9PQ==

"You’re missing my point. Nowhere did I say that dividend alone will grant you a higher total return. Even with your extremely low dividend in the example (JPM has an dividend yield of about 2% but increased it 11% annualized over the last decade. Realty Income Corporation has a dividend growth rate of 3% but has a starting yield of 5%)

If you buy the dividend stock today your personal dividend yield is going to be higher than 2% in 10 years if the stock keeps the annual dividend increases. Which you’re not getting if you bought it 10 years later. Over 30 years a bigger gap especially with drip.

It’s not shilling, it’s simple math. Did you bother to check the dividend sub? Don’t need to make up something if you just at real life examples.

Yield on cost isn't really important, if a company pays out 2% it's 2% regardless of your yield on cost. Ot just means you have  less money making more money but it still underperforms.

Lastly, I am also thinking of the psychology of the new CEO. He got obliterated by Jim Cramer on CNBC. He has a chip on a shoulder now. Being thrown under fire on tv and possible risk of getting kicked out, he has to show up for this upcoming conference call. 

I think with interest rates coming down, 4 months till election, holiday season coming up and America wanting a comeback is going to cause a surge in this stock. Prices are going to drop and people are going to spend. And they are going to give themselves a treat. 

And then the positive loop effect. Bulls are going to … push this stock up higher.

"I would say invest however you feel most comfortable. The most important thing is that you’re investing so early, and your investments will have time to grow. With time you can grow your investments through compounding interest and compounding frequency. I don’t see anything wrong with what you’re investing in as long as you feel comfortable with it in your portfolio. With the right strategies dividend investing is fine. I would suggest if you are investing in dividend stocks to throw them in a Roth IRA so dividends don’t get taxed, and you can reinvest the dividends back into the stocks through DRIP plans. If your employer offers a 401k, take advantage of it especially if they offer any type of match. Also, if you’re in good health and get a HSA it might also be a good option for you. These are just a few other options you might have that could help save on taxes. Ultimately, it’s your choice on how you invest and you’ll have to live with your choices. Some choices will be good. Some choices will be bad, but the important thing is to learn from your wins and losses. Try to do your due diligence on your investments, try to set goals, try not to invest on emotion and save. I think you’re off to a great start and I would advise anybody to start investing as early as possible. Keep up the good work.",r/stockmarket,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaWmZxa2VLb1lMdGl6ZlZPaC01YXRmdXlqVGZaUklVMHhHOUIzbEFueWNNR3dxTk9NSUstT3hoUkxSSFh4LUk2NHFnZUxnZDljVUF6aFZfRU9lbXhSMzZFdmFielA1QjFGWTRoQWtBN3Y4eXc9

"Personal question, have you been to a nike store recently? Generally, I get a different vibe from it (not in a good way) when comparing it to years past.

In terms of fashion, Nike shoes like Jordans and Dunks just aren’t as “in style” anymore, and I can’t say I’ve seen everyone I know wearing Nike like I could say a few years ago.

These are indicative of a company falling and losing the dominance its held over the footwear and athletic industries.

"You have such a primitive, basic understanding of fundamental investment philosophy, and that's okay. But, you should find it in yourself to accept your shortcomings and admit that you have much to learn before you can have the confidence you have right now. 

I agree with /u/MathEspi about this being a very obvious ChatGPT response. I don't think that is fooling anyone. You seem to be looking for a problem to your solution, so to speak. When it comes to investing, it is very easy to reaffirm your biases and create an echo chamber for yourself, because at the end of the day the market is indifferent to your opinions, and will give and take money from you as it sees fit. It doesn't help your case that you're using short dated options for all of these investments rather than just purchasing shares. It is very evident you're looking to just get rich quick. I've seen tons of accounts get blown up in a similar fashion. You'll be no different. 

You talk about loving research, but you're directly contradicting management's expectations and raising a bar higher than they set for themselves to convince yourself you'll see a return on investment. I hope you're ready for the emotional toll it will take on you when you are proven utterly wrong.

"I'll ask the important question: how much time do you want to spend, on an ongoing basis, on your portfolio?

If you want to beat the market long term, you need to become highly sophisticated and it will take tons of time. Thousands of hours of reading and research, and practice, for a couple years, then at least a few hours a week for the rest of your life. Trading is often a zero sum game. If you want to beat the market, you have to know where a stock is going earlier than other people. As a retail investor, you're competing against entire institutions that do this every second is every day. You're young enough that you can choose to go into this as your career. I don't know if that will make you happy but it's an option. If you don't do that, you need to commit time outside your other life obligations. Don't let anyone tell you there's a fast and easy way to get good at picking stocks. And don't let anyone convince you there's a way to always be right. You will still be risking money all the time. The more gains you want, the more money you have to risk losing. In that respect, it's no different from gambling.

If you don't want your portfolio to be a fixture of your life that consumes regular amounts of your time, you can just keep buying market indexes. You're so young that you're at a huge advantage. You basically can't lose with passive investing, on your time horizon.",r/stockmarket,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaeWtSZlBVYmFaTDk2a0pSNGZobEh4cEpHd1ZSTTcyWjJET0gyaFpXYktpUEJtempIWkN2ODVYR3BBR0NYeWZyRGdOdEdZMEhZSG5GNXVVY2pKUTNPc1E9PQ==

"There is a time/headspace component to individual stocks.  At 16, there are probably other things you should be doing besides tinkering with your individual holdings or looking for the next big stock. 

What a lot of people end up doing is constantly adjusting their portfolio throughout the year... and then at the end of the year they just matched or underperformed the market.  Or they end up owning so many ETFs and stocks that their portfolio is just functioning as VOO or QQQ.  

Investment companies and traders spend a lot of time and money trying to beat the market, and most of them just break even or are unsuccessful.

"I'm going to be direct with you. No advice here will help you as you've only provided percentages of distribution. I suggest that you look into either the Mean-Variance Optimisation model which uses quadratic programming (sounds heavy but it isn't) to minimise the portfolio variance for a given level of expected return or the Sharpe Ratio Optimisation model which optimise the weights to maximise the Sharpe Ratio, which is the ratio of excess return to the portfolio standard deviation (the risk).

I'm a firm believer of constructive criticism though, and I will let you know that by doing compound interest (investing x money into an etf / fund every e.g., month) is extremely good.

"If that's the case - (maybe it is) why don't you own AAPL and Microsoft and Nvidia and Costco? Those guys give everyone great returns.

I personally put 75-80% of my money in ETFs like VOO VTI and QQQ and then with my last 20% I buy individual stocks - but it's more like 8-10 stocks not just 3-4 and they are all close to equal weighted at my initial purchase and I add to the gainers and sell off the losers. When I take profit on something I add a bit to my ETF holdings and use a bit to buy my next prospective ind. Stock.

I'm aggressively conservative.... I buy more every week and never sell the ETFs if I can afford $1000 I buy $1000. If I can only afford $200 I buy $200 that week. But whatever it is - it's 75-80% to ETFs first and then consider adding to gainers and the last - maybe one new individual stock. 

(These weightings are my tax advantaged accounts) - my taxable brokerage account is almost all ETFs cause I won't buy and sell and pay taxes all year on that.",r/stockmarket,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnWWQ3MFY3UkI4Wmc1WUlJbWN1NE1sNUxHZHZUZ1Zja3ppd0xfdWZCODMzSl9BenNNVWUyT21PZGZsUVRfem5qeTVCTDB0RHBnMjMxQUlpOGhsQS1rTUE9PQ==
"Probably nothing. Or if anything I’d sell the s&p portion and pick individual stocks. You’re 1 month into investing, which means you’ve never experienced a real drawdown, made bad picks, bought high and sold low on a stock, gambled on penny stocks etc. I’m assuming you have <10k invested, in which case losing money is the best teacher and you should invest in whatever ways you want to.

If you have >50k invested don’t follow the above, sell the majority of every individual pick so that your total cost for those is <10k and hold 70% favourite major index (QQQ/SPY/VOO/VTI) and 30% bond index (TLT).
