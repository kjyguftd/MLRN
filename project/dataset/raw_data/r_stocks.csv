"Costco has major headwinds:

More competition in the grocer space (Aldi specifically trying to rapidly expand in the US)

Very slow expansion, only 20 new warehouses this year

No major investments in ecom/Omni channel

Brand new C suite with non Costco people

Non competitive pay, especially on the West Coast where a high percentage of their revenue and warehouses are (the recent price hike won't cover the changes to base and top out pay they just made
Costco lifers are retiring or becoming too old to do the job (it's extremely physically demanding)

Workers are becoming increasingly unhappy and for the first time ever a Costco Depot has unionized 

The weak membership price hike signifies their lack of belief they offer enough value to charge more and that a further raise would result in either loss of members or significant downgrades from Executive to the base level membership * they could be planning yearly hikes though, but that is against how the company has operated for decades

"Congratulations on your discovery of compound interest! It's not a new concept. $10 k for a 2 year old becomes over $2MM at 65, if they can hold on to it, and if it doesn't destroy them. You have no earthly idea what I have taught or done for my children. My two children and two step children have each received a great education at the top private schools in our area, and each received a free college education. I explained to them that I was investing a portion of their future inheritance into their education, so that they would be self sufficient and not need an inheritance, though each will receive a substantial inheritance as it turns out. Investments are already growing for current and future grandchildren. The trick, and the danger there, is giving a substantial amount of money to someone at too early of an age, or someone who cannot control the carnage that can result from early inheritance. I've watched that disaster play out in a couple of close families, who totally wrecked 2 generations with excessive money at an early age with aimless lack of purpose in life, substance abuse, and every other dysfunctional behavior possible. We have chosen not to do that. Be careful with your 2 year old's account, because, as you probably know, it will have to be turned over to them at 21, unless you are using a trust, which you probably know more about than I do. Even with trusts, just having knowledge of its existence, can be extremely destructive to the future recipients. So on a serious note, discarding all of the previous banter, be very very thoughtful in how wealth will be transferred to your heirs, because it frequently doesn't have the positive impact that we hope it would.

"I am sorry mate, but this is such a ridiculous thread. So ridiculous I'm wondering if it's a troll/ironic thread.

Reddit is not google. Reddit does not have the ability to generate money/income as google does. Look at Reddit's financials. Reddit is not a search engine and will never replace google.

Me searching for a topic also brings up Quora, New York Times, Eater, etc depending on the subject with reddit placing below other specific websites. Reddit coming up with these does nothing.

Reddit IS slanted. You have your own sub-reddits with their biases, but overall Reddit as a whole is slanted towards the left/progressivism. The upvote/downvote system further encourages that.

"They are NOT just printing shares. They are distributing shares that they own.

They have to purchase the shares that they give away. There is no net change to the 10.4 billion shares in existence.
Edit: You don't see buybacks that the company purchases for employee compensation, because the company isn't keeping those shares. They buy them and immediately transfer ownership to the employee. This is different from a share buyback, where the company uses excess cash to buy shares. This results in a net decrease in the total number of company shares, and a net increase in the per share value.

So rebuying in another account allows you to ""keep"" the investment while selling it and getting the loss in another.",r/stocks,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcW9iSEEwUFJoY2xReThvUjhqaGo5NC1LbURnU1VtVG8yb2JfWGQ3X3lQYlY5V2FNRzBmRGpVTi00WVByT1pBLTdEckNLR05HcVVhM2Q2YUZNRjQtSUE9PQ==
"This is the perfect example of how past performance is not indicative of future results. 

You’re completely ignoring historical context. The market behaves differently now than it did during that decade prior to SCHD. “Data” for SCHD prior to its inception is not real. These are fake numbers being used to draw real conclusions. 

From 1999-2011, we didn’t have free retail trading. We didn’t have social media to the scale that we have now. We didn’t have algo trading to the scale that we have now. Interest rates were very different from 2010-2011. We didn’t have a variety of publicly traded companies that we have now. More people invest now than before. Financial policy is different. This era came at the end of a budget surplus. Pretty soon we’ll have AI trading. There are literally more people on earth and in America.

"Having free rent is one thing - in the least they should help her out by paying rent to contribute towards mortgage and property taxes.

Otherwise - for more than a century - housing has been the safest leveraged investment. It can give someone  an accelerated path to wealth if one keeps buying up every 5 years. 

I’m talking about buying the house that you live in not buying a house and renting it out.

It is exactly because of that leverage that results in the accelerated gain. Stock market will give you a steady 7% or more if you’re lucky.

"The question is: buy now? 

Taking today’s price as indication of the VALUE of the company’s shares is recency bias. 

If you bought at $60 and sold at $320…. Or sat that run out, now is clearly a good time to buy if you like growing companies with ridiculously high free cash flow yield, good respect for shareholder equity, and impenetrable moats. 🤷🏻‍♂️

Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.

Ten years ago you could have said, “Microsoft?! What a joke! Its PRICE has done nothing for over a decade!

"Three things are social class and housing and family:

The distribution of wealth will make a big difference for every age group in any generation. Many boomers are long-term renters and will be very poor. Many workers may never be able to save enough to retire.

The housing shortage will also make a difference. Anyone who buys a house right now will probably watch most of their investment get eaten up by interest expense, insurance, property taxes and maintenance costs. Long term renters will keep paying ever increasing rents and soon will spend all their savings on rent.

If you don't have a good family, the costs of housing, paid child care and elder care will eat you alive.

"The issue with Intel is that they bite more than they can chew: Foundry, CPUs, GPUs/AI + even more.

They don’t have the leadership in x86 CPU and need a significant investment to regain that. This affects both client (small market share) and server/data-center (big market share). AMD is simply better in both segments, its not just down to the node being used, the architecture is superior. There are also new players in both segments (ARM offerings) that erode the market share and makes it harder to compete.

Their competitors in GPU/GPGPU (AMD/NVIDIA) have more than a decade of advantage and experience, if Intel makes one step ahead they also keep researching and developing. The gap is significant and keeps getting bigger.

Their foundry needs to scale and provide the yields/quality of TSMC in order to compete.

All their competitors (TSMC/AMD/NVIDIA) are able to invest significant parts of their revenue in their core business (Foundry, CPU/GPU, GPU, respectively). Intel has to split it to try and stay relevant while fighting against companies that might have more expertise and more money to throw at a problem/project.

A major geopolitical issue in Taiwan could bump INTC, but it would cause major struggles in the overall semi supply chain, so one stock pumping won’t matter much if big chunks of the market tank.

I simply don’t see Intel making said comeback unless their rivals “sit on their laurels” like Intel did some years ago. NVIDIA already showed they won’t by doubling their R&D efforts.

Some people seem to sure about this “comeback” but it depends on very specific (and honestly kinda unlikely) situations.

Foundry might survive, but lets remember that it won’t break even 3-4 years from now, until then their products (GPU/CPU) are what keeps the boat afloat but if they keep taking budget for that in order to fuel the Foundry play it’s just a matter of time before they run out of money to compete in their “core” business, who knows if they will keep/recover any leadership. Things look extremely rough.

"The one thing I’ll say about this case on the high PE side - all tech companies could say the same. They all spend massive quantities back into R&D and CAPEX

Amazon is a very high PE but that is a small piece of what makes a company attractive for long term investors. The reason is that PE only takes into current earnings, so if you have a rough idea of how much you think a company will grow over say 5 or 10 years, you can use these forward earnings as your true PE.

Some companies with a current PE may have a PE below 5 with this view.

"Yeah these other commentators are absolutely correct. They are actually just creating more shares. When buybacks happen the shares also basically just get destroyed. It's not like it goes in some electronic vault for them to give to employees.

The other big tech companies do this, and actually reduce share count or keep it flat.",r/stocks,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZOGFUbEVwQ2xOLUVRZldNWmJpQTZySlQ0Wi10cmxhVW5STDF3OWRHT0prQUxHWmVWeVhSSzg2eDI2REFXWWdfa2lvZG5lSDd1enRGcE96WFpsT2ZLd3c9PQ==
"Individualized cancer vaccine has had great preliminary data and have already expanded into 5 or 6 different cancer types outside of the original melanoma. Phase 3 trials seem to be going well and the company is heavily investing in this product. They’re also teaming with Merck on this product, which should provide some of the industry experience and expertise they need to get this approved and selling.

In addition, there’s a high likelihood of seeing the company approve somewhere in the ballpark of 5-15 new drugs over the next several years (company website has a great list of the pipeline and where they are at in the trials).

Given that the company has the mRNA platform, there is a lot less work to do to get their future drugs approved. Normal biotech has to basically start from scratch with each new product, but Covid essentially proved the mRNA technology, and the manufacturing process is essentially 90% identical for all drugs they make, with the main difference between drugs being the mRNA sequence. This should allow for (relatively) faster drug approvals and over the next few years I believe we’ll see this reflected in the stock price :)",r/stocks,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRDdQR2hkaE5EM3kwOXJVZEhybXQyTnRoR0JvQUZibUxDSU9EZVhkX0lDalprVTRSby1SS2QybWE0S2U2M3hMWG95Yy0wUTBWLWJzTjBpNmxJTm9ISGc9PQ==

"This doesn’t entirely demonstrate the perils of volatility decay though. You might be led to believe that as long as the underlying ends up above the original price of 100 (instead of 99) you’ll profit, but in reality going even up to 110 and back to 100 is a loss when leveraged:

Day 1:
Underlying = 100 * 1.1 = 110
Leveraged = 100 * (1 + 3 * 0.1) = 130

Day 2:
Underlying = 110 / 1.1 = 110 * 0.90909… = 100 (ie a 9.0909…% loss)
Leveraged = 130 / (1 + 3 * 0.090909…) = 94.545…

or so I believe the math goes, and you end up with less than you started with. So every single time the market goes up and down you lose money. If it just goes up a bit each day there would be no problem. 

The benefit is that if you rebalance daily, you would need a -33% crash in a day to lose everything. You could avoid the decay by leveraging continuously for say, a whole year, but if the price goes to -33% at any point during that year you get margin called and lose everything or add more liquidity and potentially lose more than you put in.",r/stocks,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNabC0wS3ZZM29GV24tWTJTUi1LSDFCaWVZUml4NFMxYWg5TDBOdXhRNzZwdWVZNi1EUVR5NGZCZThfR0c0MW84ZlVFREMtZ3pXQVlNMjNBTWZ5SS1JaHc9PQ==

"Is anyone here into $ATKR? 

It featured on my screener as cheaper to its peers with very good metrics.   
Since then I have been browsing twitter for it, I learnt that it did well during the pandemic due to double ordering but since then then it seems to be normalizing. 

Trying to form a thesis around it, they benefit for the need for electric infra in this country (the most recent marketplace episode also mentioned how the power grid needs updating). 

In terms of risks I read that their growth is dependent on metal prices. I don't quite understand how that works, any views?

"It’ll depend on how much new money you’re adding relative to the existing balance. We can see this through the Financial Crisis thanks to real-world fund DXQLX, which targets 1.75x NASDAQ monthly returns and has existed since mid-2006. Each of these people started investing in July 1, 2006 and added $500 per month through June 2011 (five years). The only difference is their starting balance:   

* [$1,000](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&sl=5r0JByGNoY0sDsl4NN4B7w) takes a big hit, $14K to $4K, but their deposits allow them to ride the rebound and they handily beat the S&P.
* [$10,000](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&sl=4QAzkJvButyymk7Emvnv6) also beats the S&P over the five years, but spends more time lagging because it takes longer to build back up after losing 80%.
* [$100,000](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&sl=jAYSl1ulwXAbczB0JRTmP) lost enough in the downturn that they still lag the S&P after five years.
* [$1,000,000](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&sl=1BQyR422THnplqARygbfVH) just barely has a positive return, less than 1% annualized. Their balance at the depths of the crash is $217,000, so adding $6,000 a year barely moved the needle. 

These cut off at 2011 for practical reasons, the website only allows free users to see so much. The market since 2009 has been unusually smooth sailing, so these people all would have done quite well since then.

"There's an old saying something along the lines of the best way to make money in a gold rush is to sell shovels. Continuing that analogy, Nvidia is manufacturing shovels, companies like Microsoft, Amazon (AWS) and Google are buying up all those shovels with the intention of renting them out at a profit. The next stage is all the companies that will rent the shovels in the hope that they can be used to make them more profit. My focus as an investor for the next few years is going to be on the large cloud/XaaS companies who I believe will see their revenues take off significantly.

Burberry has never been on my radar other than knowing they exist and I don’t know anyone in my circles that feels the same way. They just don’t offer anything that clicks with me at all and I don’t know what they sell other than what feels like generic luxury clothing. I know that’s not true but I just don’t have any exposure to the brand. Their marketing hasn’t been effective with me and they’ve failed to create anything unique or interesting enough to justify purchasing anything at their price point.

"This year has been pretty incredible so far. Using data back to 1928 for the S&P:

The highest returning year ever for the S&P was 1933 with a return of ~46%. 

Using rolling 3-point return ranges, the two most common 3-point return ranges are a tie between 10-13%, 11-14%, 12-15% and 24-27%, 25-28%, and 26-29%. Each of those ranges had 8 years where S&P returns were within their range, obviously with some double counting between them.

If you look at discrete 3-point ranges, the two most common 3-point ranges are 10-13% and 25-28% with each again having 8 years with returns falling in those ranges.

There have only been 8 years with a return higher than 28%.

The business itself is in my opinion great, so it’s a country risk premium unlike anything I’ve ever seen before. It just seems a bit excessive at the moment, but who knows. 

What makes me actually consider this is the buybacks and dividend, which creates a situation where something has to give at some point. Is it the company melting down due to politics/competition or will it be a repricing of the stock?",r/stocks,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhQkUwTHU4UmdYUXhmYTFTNDRhN3VKYlNkOVNPNTJpemE2aDVXWEtuYkhuRk9DaEplb2NfLXhhSmo4V2g4WUpZRjBuZElzb3ZwVDNlRnljQTllLU5MWUtpN0p3MFYtWVJ1bG1zQ2ZPb1A3VmM9

"No. Horrendous shareholder returns over the short and long-term to the point that should be unacceptable imo - stock is about where it was twenty years ago.

""Secondly, they are working on a new weight-loss drug that is in the late stages of tier 3(?) trials. Other weight-loss drugs have been very profitable (looking at you Ozempic)""

People kept incessantly saying on here last year ""don't buy LLY or NVO buy PFE it's cheaper and has a weight loss drug too!"" then the trial flopped and anyone who bought PFE because it looked cheaper rather than LLY/NVO was disappointed. LLY is up about 112% over the last year while PFE is down 18% - buying the worse thing because it looks cheaper often leads to disappointment. 

The PFE drug is an oral version of danuglipron, which was the drug that PFE announced the poor trial results - high rates of adverse effects and discontinuation - of in December of last year.

""While the most common adverse events were mild and gastrointestinal in nature consistent with the mechanism, high rates were observed (up to 73% nausea; up to 47% vomiting; up to 25% diarrhea). **High discontinuation rates, greater than 50%, were seen across all doses compared to approximately 40% with placebo.""**

""First off, it has a very attractive dividend, at $1.68 a year (5.0891%)""

Don't buy a stock because of the dividend - the dividend is taken out of the share price and people have elevated the idea of dividends too much. Having a fundamental thesis and evaluating quality (management, etc) is far more important than a dividend. 

""Pfizer has a lot of name recognition from during Covid. ""

Pfizer made a lot of money from covid but their history of inept M & A means that the market isn't showing any confidence that they'll actually spend that money well.

If PFE got a new CEO on the same level of Larry Culp coming to GE (and PFE really is the Immelt-era GE of pharma) I'd maybe consider it but otherwise there's too many good companies to invest money in one that isn't and arguably has an unacceptable record of shareholder returns over a long enough period at this point.",r/stocks,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNna2ZnVEktUXpsRWJUUUl1NHJjR21HR1dRczJCMFlWVnJ2Yzd2emFCcDhiUE81ZjhYNGdPVlFLeUhqY1VwNXdUMWZpWUNXazJuUnJGQjdRSnh3YmNpTFE9PQ==

"well as the prime adversaries  of the US I think China's risk premium is not actually adequately priced.  If it goes down by another 20-50% I would not touch it as an investment and would play some high risk short term option swing trades.

  
now something like EWW dropping 10% on election (same party....same platform), thats a trade I like...

at every turn the US is actively working against china, Huwei bans, AI bans, semiconductor restrictions, blacklisting chinese companies, Supporting Taiwan, trade sanctions, tariffs, support of separatists Chinese factions like Falongong etc etc.  The question of you going long china, is that is that enough of money to pay you to go against America on a long term scale, and I would say no, everyone who opposed America has failed.   Its a cultural and existential war of annihilations for sure and has been that way with China ever since Xi has been in power, and he is very much Putin like in his thinking and behavior.  It will never get back to the way it was in the 2010s till Xi's out and new leadership that is reconciliatory to the US appears.  If that happens, then long China, until then, no thanks.

Additional trading Chinese ADRs are extremely risky because any signs of a shooting war, not saying even taiwan invasion but just a minor shooting war/border skirmish, you can easily see ADRs delisted or sanctioned you taking 100% instant loss, its absolutely no skin of governements back, and while a bigger deal than the Russian ADR delistings, US companies will just take the write down and wont oppose it",r/stocks,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnZTBNSlNhVTBibFJNemJacjM0bzE1dlFyQlk0aG5vRXRmNFJYNHpCdTBtNVhrZ0ctbjE4cHRVeHpmTW1vZWFmUXo1Q1JYczZ6SzBScEU4Z3oxUnRIZVE9PQ==

LLY and Novo have guaranteed growth for at least until 2030. The weight loss-drug market is essentially a duopoly. It’ll be very hard for Pfizer to break into the weight loss drug market with its oral trial. LLY and Novo have pretty much developed a oral pill that are both in the late phase 2 trial stages.
