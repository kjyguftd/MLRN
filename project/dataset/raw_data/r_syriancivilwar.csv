As for the radicals, there were attacks, but finding them is hard since there are loads of information.

There was the 2022 Hadera and also the Beersheba shooting.

IS and AQ don't have a strong presence in Palestine, they are limited to lone wolf attacks.

In Palestine, the salafi jihadists fight with hamas, most of them are present in rafah since it's close to egypt and many families were split between egypt and gaza like the dogmush clan.

The Islamic State branch in Palestine is called Sheikh Omar Hadid Brigade.

June 3, 2015 — Two separate rocket attacks were launched on Israel from Gaza, both of which failed. One landed in the Negev, while the other landed near Ashkelon.[52][53]

June 11, 2015 — An attempted rocket attack targeting Ashkelon was carried out from Gaza. The rocket failed to reach its target and exploded in Gaza instead.[54][53]

July 16, 2015 — A rocket attack from Gaza aimed at Ashkelon failed, with the rocket exploding over open territory in the western Negev.[53]

August 26, 2015 — Another similar rocket attack failed, with the rocket landing between a small Israeli community and the border security fence.[53][55]

September 18, 2015 — Two rockets were launched in an attack on southern Israeli cities. The first rocket landed in Sderot, destroying a bus and damaging a residence, though no casualties were reported. The Iron Dome system intercepted the second rocket, fired a few hours later, which was aimed at Ashkelon.[56]

September 29, 2015 — Two separate rocket attacks aimed at Ashdod failed. Both rockets were intercepted by the Iron Dome system.[57][53]

October 26, 2015 — A rocket attack from Gaza failed, with the rocket landing in open territory in the western Negev.[58][53]

During 2015 they got some recruits and then they slowly were erroded.

And How is this related, you can be secular and religious, but not when you call for islamic caliphate or wanting to create islamic emarite.

I witnessed them in the front of me calling for massacres and displacement of different religions. Even my friends got killed due to ""secular mortar shelling on CIVILIAN areas controlled by the government"" and the ""secular suicide bombing targeting of 2 ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS"" where most of the deaths were literally young children under the age of 12. And you know what was the worst part?
The cheering, takbiring and giving sweets to celebrate killing ""infidel's children massacre"".

It maybe started as a movement to change the situations, but it turned into destruction, bloodsheding, and pure hatred among different Syrian cultures.

As for being entitled we both have blood in this conflict, I'll never forget what happened in the ghouta and I see those who don't recognise the catastrophe the same way you see zionist bootlickers. This is no game, those who don't recognise the catastrophe shouldn't be respected.

Civil discussions might help us get closer together, might help us recognise each other circumstances, but as long my memories in Damascus are of relatives who died, of neighbours who either got killed or are in Idlib. Then don't expect me to respect your opinion. 

I don't care about secularism anymore, secularism was Assad and now I hate everything about him. The more I see people arguing for Assad by the secularism argument the more I hate secularism. 

I've left Syria 3 months ago, there is no way I'll forget what Assad thugs has done. 

I saw a kid probably 9yo being beaten in a checkpoint, blood all of his face, they kicked him, beated him, I left and probably he died due to all of that. Fuck secularism if that's it.

"Some additional points, nsura had its news agency called al manarat al baydaa, where isaa (jesus christ) was supposed to appear in the end of times.

There was a song they had about a war in dabiq against the romans. There also is the idea that constantinople (istanbul) needs to be reconquered.

>Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:

>The Last Hour would not come until the Romans would land at al-A'maq or in Dabiq. An army consisting of the best (soldiers) of the people of the earth at that time will come from Medina (to counteract them). When they will arrange themselves in ranks, the Romans would say: Do not stand between us and those (Muslims) who took prisoners from amongst us. Let us fight with them; and the Muslims would say: Nay, by Allah, we would never get aside from you and from our brethren that you may fight them. They will then fight and a third (part) of the army would run away, whom Allah will never forgive. A third (part of the army) which would be constituted of excellent martyrs in Allah's eye, would be killed and the third who would never be put to trial would win and they would be conquerors of Constantinople. And as they would be busy in distributing the spoils of war (amongst themselves) after hanging their swords by the olive trees, the Satan would cry: The Dajjal has taken your place among your family. They would then come out, but it would be of no avail. And when they would come to Syria, he would come out while they would be still preparing themselves for battle drawing up the ranks. Certainly, the time of prayer shall come and then Jesus (peace be upon him) son of Mary would descend and would lead them. When the enemy of Allah would see him, it would (disappear) just as the salt dissolves itself in water and if he (Jesus) were not to confront them at all, even then it would dissolve completely, but Allah would kill them by his hand and he would show them their blood on his lance (the lance of Jesus Christ).

"Assad is seen good by outsiders, syrian diaspora but the only group that has a support for Assad inside of Syria are the alawites, they hate him too, he never developed their areas so tat they'll always join the SAA and work in government jobs, they feel poor deprived but might support him since they view rebels as sunni terrorists who will kill them.

Druze has been calling for Assad to step down, Christians inside of Syria have a negative opinion on him and want him to step down.

As for the whole rest of Syria, it's a boiling with suffering, despair, and hopelessness. 

Half of Syria has been displaced whether internally or externally. Every family, especially sunni, had a member that was killed by Assad, other factions too killed syrians but never to the extent Assad did.

It says Assad killed 600k - 800k, estimates are always underestimates, my cousin for example was killed and no one registered his killing, on the regime papers, he is alive when he was killed by them, I'd put the minimum killed at a million.

Tribal conflicts, Assad doesn't govern, clashes wherever tribes exist is the norm, he isn't secularising Syria, within tribal areas, if a girl is seen next to a non relative, she is beaten heavily might even be killed and Assad doesn't care, hell criminals are everywhere. There is more freedom in this country to criminals, bad traditions, and SAA thugs. 

My friend lives in houran, his house was hit by tribal clashes.

Daraya, in Damascus, too, is a no man's land, and so is the Qaboun and a part of harasta. All of these places have been stolen even the metal inside the concrete has been stolen and sold. These places have their people elsewhere around Damascus or in Idlib or outside Syria.

Neighbours who we don't know where they are, relatives who disappeared, we won't be talking about these with foriegners.

Go to Aleppo, part of it is fine, another part too from a post apocalyptic movie and had most of it's people pushed to Turkey, Idlib etc.

Homs? The sunni rural areas are dead.

Aleppo is the industrial city and Damascus is the capital, Daraa feels more like the farm of Syria where we get our food, that has a lot of tribes, some of which are fighting each other, with IS, kidnappings and all. So is the badiyyah Deir ezzor and such places.

So why do we get all of those youtubers going there and having a very different experience to syrians on the ground? Well that's [the regime propoganda](https://x.com/abdalhadealani/status/1807013216523853824?s=46&t=pgSALAcymFjhkP2hKBkc0Q).

Syrians are very poor, the average salary is very low in major cities where life is expensive they might get higher salaries like 50-100 dollars, but the average for all of Syria is around 10 dollars or even lower a month. 

The youth have mostly left the country to avoid military conscription.",r/syriancivilwar,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhRVNzQ0s3N0RLSkl0NU9sTGJ2SHJoUjhkQlVoMXhvQjlDMlVaSlZEM2hNTUgtODEtaHQxV0p3WUV4bnM0UGtvYmpfajByNml5ckZwUS1GVFFsT2wyZVVkTGRIYVRwSkgxSFV1QS1zMDduRzQ9
"I wanted to point out that the informational value of this video is close to zero. You don't see much of the protests and what is happening there, you don't see anyone shooting, you don't see any victims There are better reports on today's events, here is one from Hawar, which I wouldn't exactly call ""Assad-friendly"", usually they are considered pro-SDF. One detail is quite interesting, as it concerns the peacefullness of the protests. 


>Some areas witnessed the *closure of polling centers and destruction of ballot boxes*, while other areas saw protests and demonstrations. [...]


>Additionally, some protesting residents *attacked voting centers* in the As-Suwayda countryside, destroying and setting fire to ballot boxes outside centers in villages and towns like Arman, Al-Qanat, Al-Qurayya, and Salim.


I wouldn't exactly call the vandalization of electoral centers ""peaceful protests"".

The video (there were lots of these *-24 accounts some years ago) shows a bleeding man on a street. Additionally, there is the sound of gunfire. Who shoots remains unknown.
