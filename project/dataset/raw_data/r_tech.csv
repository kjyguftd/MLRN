"“I marked it AWK for awkward.” 

– Sincerely, Raymond Holt",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTQUl2dFFwTlVnc2h1ZG9nNmt4bjZ2TEU5ZWk2RU5EM0NEVENKR0RtdWw3YUlaZ1UxMUdvTHZEVVZHeW5Xa0ZLYTFrdmF4Yi1RMjNEcS1uRjJ4M3FqOUE9PQ==
"I used to argue for this, too, that profit brings innovation. But I honestly don't think I believe it in quite the same I did before. I now believe in the negative hypothesis, rather than the positive.

What I mean is this: in places like the Soviet Union, where people knew, almost for a certainty, that their work and ingenuity would go unrewarded and possibly even get them in trouble somehow, it was extremely difficult to foster an environment of innovation and creativity. We see that in similar societies, as well. So, reasonably enough, the inability to profit from one's ideas seems to crush the drive toward new ideas. 

It doesn't follow from that, though, that merely providing the ability to profit will, in itself, drive creation, or that it's the only or even the best means of doing so. And I think we've seen, many times throughout history, that the best and most important new ideas come mostly out of a sense of curiosity combined with the freedom to think and experiment, rather than a simple profit motive alone.",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTbDgtV0s0UHQxdFJXLU9ITERlSnZPNkxReEh3dXVfRV9CY2NzRWxyNUoxZGtadWlsbEtrSHhVZXlXSTM5TTIzT1Jzak84RHRycXRqLU0wT0NqUnU2eHc9PQ==

"I mean, yes, we should, and yes, it does. But the problem is that, even if we lived in the rosy-hued, idyllic picture of America from 50s propaganda - which we absolutely do not and never did - Xi Jinping does not give one rusty yuan about international cooperation, particularly with the United States. Like Putin, he might entertain the idea from time to time, when it suits him to do so, but he is in the business of building a superpower, not holding hands in a circle at the UN.

I want to make it clear that I don't think the US gives a damn about cooperating with China, either. It's just that Xi has an extra incentive to get ahead at any cost.

I don’t believe you. Explain why superdense coding gives “more bits”. (It can be argued both ways because the standard of “more bits” is imprecise.)

> If it was as expensive to fragile we would be getting dramatically faster results.

Classical algorithms existed before classical computers… not having a device to implement them on didn’t hold them back. Moreover, we have a well developed theory of quantum mechanics. We can come up with algorithms without working hardware.

> No one has really devled into the true potential of quantum computing because everyone is still struggling to make it practical.

"And then there was Aldi in Europe, until about 10 years ago they did not use scanners but their employees were insanely fast either way. They had all the prices memorized and would punch them in and move the groceries faster to the end of the belt than any human being could possibly bag them. Cash payments were quick and easy too, as the employees were still able to do basic math back then and usually had the change ready a millisecond after you handed over the cash.",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTUDVkZFZZc214eTVITWRHYlBzSFVUY0tMeU1SYmJRMmhwc0UwNm5jaWQtUTNhWGFtWGxpeWxwVjZSLWE2UGJyRHF5N09GT2k3bkdTQ3ZpNF9TOFNhVVlremxNTFRlcGNQbWxvSWpvV1MwLVk9
"I assume like li-ion they use a CC/CV charging scheme - that's Constant Current/Constant Voltage. The batteries are charged at a constant rate of current until the voltage rises to a set maximum, then tapered off to maintain that voltage. The first 80% or so of charging takes place during the constant current portion. Furthermore multi cell batteries require a battery monitoring system that balances the individual cell charges as capacity and charge level may drift as the battery ages. This can also add a small amount of time to the final charging.

So because the current to charge to that point is no longer constant and the curve is relationship is no longer linear after 90%, giving the total charge time would be misleading when comparing usable capacity across chemistries - you don't have to charge them to 100% every time you use them.

"Hey thanks for giving an intelligent response :) I agree that more conditions than profit motive alone are necessary for the best innovation. But the profit motive is the fuel that drives people to keep working even when it's uncomfortable and no longer fun. And maybe more importantly- it allows people without much money to start businesses and pursue ideas that they wouldn't be able to afford just on curiosity alone

In a society without the profit motive, entrepreneurs and inventors wouldn't be able to raise the capital necessary for their innovations if banks and lenders didn't have faith that the business would make profit in the future and thus be able to pay the loan back with interest. If you remove the profit motive from society then you also remove capital investment and market liquidity, as people would basically only invest in stuff if they were friends with the CEO or personally liked the project.

Without the ability to attract investment for a good idea, the work of innovation would be available to only the already very rich in society, which was basically the situation in the middle ages, before the spread and success of capitalism. Normal people with great ideas that would benefit society would have no mechanism to make their ideas reality, because they'd have no mechanism to attract investment because there would be no mechanism in society to reward good investment",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTdUc1eXdobDI3NGxtbHJkaTFJUnp5ZDBXUGl6NVE4VVdRZ2dFcjQ3akRVMlBuWnNNdlhzRjAxTzNRWDBYRk11ejQ5eHM1MVJXUVl4ZTlMbFJiWElQMEE9PQ==

"In Germany at least, Aldi introduced barcode scanners some time after the Euro became our new currency, in 2003 or 2004 I think. I'm not sure whether Aldi North and Aldi South introduced them at different times because I live firmly in Aldi North territory and that's my only perspective. US Aldi stores are all owned by Aldi South so they might've done that later or earlier, idk.

Employees didn't memorize prices directly though, they used 3-4 digit PLU (price look-up) codes instead. PLUs are much easier to memorize and faster to type than prices, and they also only had to memorize regular stock while seasonal and limited time articles just had the PLU printed very visibly on the box.

Since they got barcode scanners, employees now only have to memorize where the barcodes are on each article, plus the PLUs they still use for unpackaged groceries such as vegetables or baked goods. Limited time articles that are too big to put on the conveyor also still have a visible PLU on the box.",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTRm1nS2hJZHFoYnRnbjR6Zms1OVByOE5MeGZobV90LW1lWEpnZ0l1dG5aSGVLV1AtUElLVUlPb053V0Ztd2JuQmtVVWhCTVlmbnRsMnlMVkRTNmo2LXc9PQ==

Yes, but also money is money. 

If they're making 10% margin on your purchase and the credit card company is taking 4% of that then they're better off serving 1 person who pays by check than two that pay by card. 

Check fraud might be on the rise but if you are committing check fraud, you probably aren't doing it in person because it's too easy to get caught.

"So I’ve been following green concrete. It was a pet project of my advisor in undergrad and I’ve been curious.

One mitigation method is replacing some of that Portland cement with Fly Ash, a byproduct of coal fire power plants.

"Okay let's try to explain this a different way. At best, your money is just going in a circle with stops in other people's or businesses accounts, the last and biggest of which (your credit card company) they're probably making interest on.

You say you're paying less because you get cash back right? Wrong. You along with EVERYONE else is paying more, especially on small purchases. Yes you may technically pay less at checkout when you factor in the cash back but the business that sold it to you also factored in the cash back and other cc transaction fees like per-swipe or even worst case manual entry (costs more) and added it in to their price. Just because someone who pays cash doesn't get 2% back doesn't mean you won, it means you lost a little less. And in the meantime, before you manually cash out those funds or they're automatically transferred at the end of the month it sits in the CC company's bank account along with every other customer's making them money and not you.

> It seems hardware is not where the growth will come from for Apple if you ask me

Apple has always been a hardware company; they are largest hardware producing tech company. Sure their software makes them money too, but not on the same scale as their hardware. I don't think this will change; I cannot imagine the bulk of apple's revenue coming from Apple music subscriptions, or selling copies of final cut pro.

Comment OPs problem was probably that, for a company with so many resources (human/financial), you would expect them to be the main innovative force driving all the other players to copy their technology. Instead, they were the ones copying  design decisions from other companies. 

I think that has somewhat changed recently. The airpods are arguably the best earbuds out there, and were copied by all the large android manufacturers. I feel the XR headset stuff will pay out over time too, once the design is simplified and the price point reduced.",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTdTRuT25oVUctNjJEMXc2VHNPQ3lMZ3dlQmZ0TVZoaGRBcUVUazllUWROX1lUeWVGN25iZy1wSDBpV0h6RHV6dlNCVWpNYWwzdldvQ3VYMEVWYmpSS1E9PQ==

"I feel I need to clarify this exactly, because I don’t think I did well enough. 

Fly Ash concrete IS weaker. A mix of 30% will have a compressive strength markedly lower than a pure Portland cement mix. 

HOWEVER!

Fly Ash concrete has chemical properties that make it highly desirable for foundation construction. It increases corrosion resistance, especially in areas with groundwater pollution. It is currently the best solution to combat sulfates eating your concrete foundation. 

Add that the decrease compressive strength is negligible. Structural concrete is usually designed for a 4,000 psi compressive strength, but field break tests usually go upwards of 5,000 psi. I do not need that extra 1,000 psi. It’s wasted. It is a better use of money to get corrosion resistant concrete over extra strength I don’t need.",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTSU9SUGwtaGJxcG85M2tvLUtId3FXdm5XOWhoajNQY3ZiVWVwUC1sQ0l0OU43WW1ZdThkZVRNRnRLOWxPdG04dXZhYjZuNHo0U05pQzZjVjJKeFAzdGc9PQ==

"Nothing to do with a brain implant giving you the ability to speak a language you don’t know.

Basically, when it comes to making a brain implant that allows paralyzed people to speak, how does that work for someone who’s bilingual? The researchers found that the signals sent for creating sounds was similar between languages, so giving an implant to someone who speaks both English and Spanish, training the implant to recognize English sounds also helped it to recognize Spanish sounds. This will help to develop implants that allow a paralyzed bilingual person to speak both/all of the languages they know",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTMllGejVxeEExckdUWGFrejlIRm1KMEpUbC0xUEU1TXI2a1d1RDVteVFtbER6UEJmc3k5UGNYUF9FN3hHYkk0a2lyMHpRUDZWZUpqLTd2T1gwOE9rU3c9PQ==

"I reread my comment, I’m not sure how it’s unclear the connection I was making. I’ll try rewording it. The first commenter asked what it (the paralysis) had to with “making him bilingual.” It did *not* make him bilingual. He was already bilingual.

The man is unable to speak at all, due to the paralysis. The implant, when developed, would enable him to speak again. The clinical trial found that the signals controlling the vocal chords, tongue, etc. were similar between the languages, so training the implant to recognize words in English could help it to recognize words in Spanish, and vice versa.

It does not give you the ability to speak a language you don’t know, it’s about restoring your ability to speak in both/all of the languages you *do* know, if you can’t speak due to paralysis",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTQWpjQmxvYUFYMDVnOHFfRW5kZl9RWmVING5teDdMbDIyZWJpWUpValI4anFJVFg2WEtoUnFwMnFGeS1zenN0b00wc0oxZUlHX1pOakVxSndfTFdIQkE9PQ==

"What I’m getting from the article is that his brain is doing all the work of forming the sound of the word, the implant is just interpreting the neurological activity of intending to make that sound and translating that into a signal to the parts of the body needed to do so. Since English and Spanish have a similar phonemic inventory, it would make sense that the signals for both would also be similar. 

It kind of lost me when it started talking about training the AI and word errors, though. If I’m understanding it correctly, the AI wouldn’t actually need to know a language, it would only need to know which signals correspond to which sound and then what it needs to do to make that sound.

Apples operating system costs $0 versus Microsoft Windows that costs several hundred dollars depending on version and country you buy it in.

Also MacOS users can easily transition to a free Linux distro, especially since the file system and environment is very familiar already being UNIX-like.

"I've always thought cyber sec was cool but anyways, I'm only tangential to this stuff but the short version is that you use testing to iterate a computational physics model, not the design itself necessarily. Once your computational model looks good you let it loose on optimization of the design. 

I've seen simulation that is shockingly similar to the real life test that follows it. The goal being to reduce the amount of costly real life testing required. Maybe completely.

It's a subtle difference but one is iterating the design and seeing what works. The other is iterating the understanding of the underlying physics so that you already know how a given design will work.

Edit: for basic stuff the physics is also already known via material properties but in a complex and dynamic during crush assembly it gets hairy.",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUR2o4d2RHZl9uNEdHNVFIWC1Ga2hnV2d0MXp0dTVPZTNlWDk0S281amhGM0xIeEpkMmo3Q3JKM2phbFQ3aTJTcHJFRFJ3Mjl5cFk0MXdiMDJ0b2pieVE9PQ==

The whole point is you fill a black box with math and feed it the data, because you know 2 things: this data contains the information you need, and you will never decipher it. The whole point is you don't look under the hood. You made the engine so you wouldn't have that problem anymore.

"Molten Oxide Electrolysis. 600,000 amps to produce ten tons a day. A largely useless metric unless we know the voltage needs of the system. 

If we assume it to be 480V, and we assume those 600,000 amps are spread out over a 12 hour work cycle (the article doesn’t say) then we are looking at 24MWh of electricity. Not a small sum. Could be completely different math, but the article doesn’t get into it. Lastly I’d want to learn of the losses.

You lose 50% of your energy when you turn coal into steam to turn a turbine to produce electricity. Then water electrolysis has a 20-30% energy loss. So we are looking at a pretty big system loss when compared to just using that energy to smelt.

"Fourteen years ago, a journalist named Melanie Reid attempted a jump on horseback and fell. The accident left her mostly paralyzed from the chest down. Eventually she regained control of her right hand, but her left remained “useless,” she told reporters at a press conference last week. 

Now, thanks to a new noninvasive device that delivers electrical stimulation to the spinal cord, she has regained some control of her left hand. She can use it to sweep her hair into a ponytail, scroll on a tablet, and even squeeze hard enough to release a seatbelt latch. These may seem like small wins, but they’re crucial, Reid says.

“Everyone thinks that \\[after\\] spinal injury, all you want to do is be able to walk again. But if you’re a tetraplegic or a quadriplegic, what matters most is working hands,” she said.

Reid received the device, called ARCex, as part of a 60-person clinical trial. She and the other participants completed two months of physical therapy, followed by two months of physical therapy combined with stimulation. The results, [published today in Nature Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-02940-9), show that the vast majority of participants benefited. By the end of the four-month trial, 72% experienced some improvement in both strength and function of their hands or arms when the stimulator was turned off. Ninety percent had improvement in at least one of those measures. And 87% reported an improvement in their quality of life.",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVRl9ud0ZxVzJwWVpMR3RYYlNCVHZJNWZNTzVWcmxiT3RnTi1QZGxWamwwUGVSMFlKbktubC0xSTVBdC14bDZ0M2hldUlIX0pVeUFyRkkzTGxMSDVwaHQ5a0tlQ3B3eFV3djlvazNsV0M4V2s9

"As a software engineer with a degree in the fine-arts, here’s my two cents… 

The A wasn’t added to be inclusive… it was added to reflect the actual skills needed in modern careers.

Proficiency in the arts is particularly important to engineers and computer scientists in emerging industries, such as themed experiences, gaming, simulation. 

Programmers and engineers are increasingly teamed up with artists and designers to co-develop software, products, prototypes, design systems for brands and their suites of products and more. And some talented folks can fill several of those roles.

The Arts in STEAM also reflects the important of HCI or human computer interaction design which focuses on designing and evaluating technologies that people interact with and make technology more user-friendly, efficient, and enjoyable. To list some specific careers: UI - User interface design, UX - user experience design, IxD - interaction design.

Of course there are many careers that require several skills. As an example, my last project: Designing interactive charts and graphs, after normalizing complex computations and data sets from several API endpoints. Implementing them through the addition of reusable components and expand the design system with new color pallets, interface elements, and an overall better experience for viewing complex data while improving the customers brand experience.

"> Molten Oxide Electrolysis. 600,000 amps to produce ten tons a day. A largely useless metric unless we know the voltage needs of the system.

Chemical reactions like that are fairly low voltage similar to the reactions in batteries so I'm guessing low single digits in volts. A friend of mine works at a nearby Zinc factory and I think they also use hundreds of thousands of amps at something like 2 volts.

> Liquid electrolyte isn’t specified. But it’s gotta be an interesting one to coexist with metal iron at 1600 degrees.

In my work I have made six concrete test cylinders a day for two years and broken the same cylinders at intervals to test their strength. The test batches were normal 6 sack per yard production mixes to test quality continuity. I also made many more cylinders to test any number of admixtures and aggregates. Flyash was a main interest because when allowed to dry it appeared to harden. And harden it did but not nearly as much as concrete. So it acted mainly as a filler and replacing cement with flyash in the same volumes made the concrete weaker.

"Condoms. Vasectomies. Family Planning. Withdrawal (technically true. But foolish.)

According to https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-method-use-united-states

Of 72 million women in the study, 10 .4 million relied on condoms and vasectomies. 1.2 million on natural Family Planning. So let’s count that as 0.6 million for men*. Then a whopping 2.6 million relied on the withdrawal method. So let’s count that as 1.3 for the men. 

10.4 + 0.6 + 1.3 = 12.3 million. 

Which is 18%. Roughly 1 in 5.

So yeah, the female version, while full of side effects most people don’t realize the severity, the male version that is currently potentially used is literally deca or trenbolone lol.   


Female birth control is just deca with some atoms moved around


But trust me you do not want all men on trenbolone.

"Here is why male birth control will never be viable. 

Imagine a fire squad of roughly 50-150 million men with rifles all aimed at one person. What the male contraceptives do is deteriorate these rifles in one way or another. However even if 99.9999% those rifles are made unfit that would still be about a thousand bullets headed at that person. It only takes one. 

Female birth control works by keeping that one person either safely away from the firing line in the case of hormonal birth control, I.e. not releasing an egg. Far easier to keep one person in a safe house than to disarm roughly 100,000,000 rifles. 

Or in the case of a condom putting a bulletproof glass barricade up.

"This isn’t quite the right way to frame it. I used to believe this too, but it’s really more of a fundamental biological issue. The female reproductive system isn’t always-on by design - the release of new eggs stops during pregnancy, for example. So there’s a natural off-switch that can be taken advantage of, it’s sensitive to relatively small and safe hormonal changes, and while it does have side-effects it is relatively safe and we have a wide variety of options. 

The male reproductive system, for contrast, never turns off. There is no dormant period, there is no menopause, sperm production keeps chugging along until the gametes accumulate damage due to aging. If you want to reduce male fertility, you’ve got no natural switches to take advantage of. It’s just a physiologically more difficult problem, which is why the trials on candidate drugs so far have had much more severe side-effects. We’re talking about upticks in *suicide* among the treatment groups, not something that should be taken lightly.

With that said, the G-forces being discussed have to do with acceleration: Whenever your spaceship speeds up, slows down, or changes direction, you feel it (just like you feel it in a car or an airplane). Since your body is essentially just a squishy ballon full of smaller, fluid-filled balloons, there’s a maximum amount of force that it can endure… so while your ship can accelerate at a certain rate without harming you, anything too much beyond that will cause you to resemble a jelly-topped pancake that someone threw at your cockpit’s back wall.",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWbGJPMzZKa0hMOUx3TUVCRTh5MTVVZGhISTF3Q1N5T25BZlhUYy15T1hlOVVfVjVmcURTNzJIN3Fyb055OVFIbGZ5bkVEdTBUVkhGaF83aFVnTDAxQWc9PQ==

I don't know why they wouldn't be doing larger studies if they were confident with it, it sounds pretty good, and they'd instantly have 100% of the market share for it. And making some money would be better than making none, plus it takes away from sales their competitors would make.

"What you are talking about is like tracing the path of individual electrons in a conducting wire. We can describe, *completely and very elegantly*, the motion of electrons and their other parameters. We can describe the circuit they occupy completely. We have EM field theory and Ohm's law and all this other shit. 

What you all are talking about is like trying to tag a particular electron at one end and watch its path til it arrives at the other end, except less cool. You can't do it. You can't make sense of it. You won't learn anything from it. And the thing you want to gain from it is what you would gain from understanding and solving the equations of motion that describe what it's doing. *You can't look at what it's doing by its very nature*. You want to bitch that AI is being used so recklessly, but you don't know the first thing about it. You're in tech, but you're somehow not aware of abstraction layers?

"*And you are right now arguing to the point your earlier arguments falls apart. This SPECIFIC one:*

>**We KNOW how it works!!** You idiots want to look at the WRONG THING to understand how it works. 'What it's doing' and 'how it works' are two different goddamn things.

So, wise guy, you said right here that we KNOW how it works! Now tell me, HOW? Do you know the 'specifics' of how it works?

Answer: we DON'T.

Because we *DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS DOING*! We can't describe the AI 'circuit' or the theories and all this other shit!!

And thus, here you are saying this:

>*People that say this entirely miss the point of machine learning. It exists to find patterns a human could not. Given the time, patience, and caffeine, you could do it on paper. You don't because you went to the trouble of getting a computer to do it.*

>*This whole 'we don't know how it works' is the fucking POINT of it. It's doing math.* ***Do you still want to know?***

The answer, if you're in higher learning, is YES.

The first people who came across piston fire starters just simply shrugged and said 'it is so, we don't need to know further'. Other people took that, learned the **thermodynamics** behind it and came up with the *EFFING Diesel Engine*!!

The first people who came across mixing several things together to make a ""boom"" just simply shrugged and said 'it is so, let's just make pretty fireworks in the skies'. Other people took that, learned the **chemistry** behind it and came up with the *EFFING Gunpowder*!!

The first people who came across deadly shit-stained standing water just simply shrugged and said ""don't drink it unless it is diluted, it is poisoned by misama"" and continued dumping waste into rivers. Other people took that, learned the **biology** behind it and came up with the *EFFING Germ Theory*!!

Throughout ***ALL of HISTORY of ALL THE SCIENCES***, so many bloody things we know of as solidly founded sciences are people coming across closed systems, and instead of shrugging and leaving it alone, continued to study it, learn the principles behind it, and come up with new or BETTER knowledge.

Just because machine-learning AI is man-made and we know the process of creating more of them doesn't mean shit. There's something in there *that we don't KNOW. And we should take that, learn how their* ***ALGORITHMS*** *behind it works, and come up with new and fantastic creations t*o *fill in the gaps in our computer sciences!!*

That you're arguing the opposite after revealing your academia position is utterly incomprehensible. You should throw that card away for even taking this position. You're not an academic, and your position is terrible. I believe there is nothing more that needs saying here.

*(On a digressing sidenote, tracing the path of* *~~individual~~* *electrons in a conducting wire is precisely how IC chip manufacturing and engineering works. From vacuum tubes to seeding of materials onto a silicon wafers, it is to create SPECIFIC conditions though SPECIFIC electrical/physical properties to make electrons move a SPECIFIC way on a circuit so as to be able to represent a SPECIFIC binary state, and through that do very SPECIFIC things on it.*

Edit: and currently, manufacturing SPECIFIC high capacity IC chips require a SPECIFIC wavelength of light focused to a SPECIFIC size by SPECIFICALLY designed series of focusing mirrors to a SPECIFIC precision of microns to etch SPECIFIC amounts of material onto a silicon wafer.

"You think you’re making a good argument, but you’re not. For starters, let’s clarify, we know exactly how ensemble methods work and what they do. They are just made of math that there isn’t enough time in a lifetime to do, but there is no mystery at all. That’s the majority of machine learning algorithms. Classification, recommendation, identifying candidates from sets, reducing relevant information from hundreds of features to the first handful are examples that have been in heavy use for years. Identifying cancerous moles accurately is one big success story for these types. 

This whole tangential subject is about neural nets. We do know how they work. You have a network of nodes with functions in them. You feed them your feature set for a data point, and they make a guess. You show them the answer, and then they adjust their node functions and try again. There are some methods, like gradient boosting, to improve training, but they actually aren’t necessary because the node functions are very simple. The network has layers that play certain mathematical roles, and we can describe those with math. For example, there is a layer of activation functions, which act as a weighting filter for values respective of certain thresholds. 

This guy doesn’t have the jargon to convince you, but he’s right. Looking at a bag of activation functions won’t tell you anything. Looking at the node structure does sometimes. Having reverence for discovery isn’t enough, the devil’s in the details. You actually have to do the math to know what you’re talking about, and you seem like you haven’t.",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjWGY3cFlGN0UxRXdQNURiWXZFTURtamlVekNUU3ZpVFVrTVVJVEw5Zk1CYXVYZkhlckZ1Y2JqSjU0SmZnMWxKRjZyRkFZVFZYVXNVcTg2NkRMNXNMREE9PQ==

"It is, actually, in the case of machine learning. Math is the only thing an algorithm understands, much like voltage is the only thing a computer understands. You could ‘watch’ your algorithm’s nodes while a particular data point’s features are passed through the nodes, and see how those functions change. But you do that many times, in different orders, with different training subsets. If you really want to see how the inclusion of one data point changes the overall output, you will have to interpret some very bland calculations, bland to the point of meaninglessness. Doing it this way just wouldn’t really tell you much - unless you wrote another algorithm to describe the changes in a way a human could understand. 

But it would all be math, start to finish. Validity and attribution are concepts native to mathematics and to machine learning.

"Yes you’re correct, but you’re missing the same point as the other guy in all these: 

As you already know, Machine knowledge algorithms currently is to, crudely put, throw shit at a wall using multiple adjusted mathematical formulae, and from the results select the ones which formed a promising picture to further refine the process. (*The removing cancerous modules bit, among other things yes?)*

We all know how the nodes work, we all know how the weighing anchors, the various layers, etc… but we don’t know the WHOLE of the system.

Ultimately we can throw shit on the wall all day long and hope the testing criteria is correct enough to weed out all the wrong results. BUT it is also true we don’t know how the created, refined algorithm got to that results, or if there is a bias in there that might ruin said results outside of test parameters (*the oh so famous “hallucination” of chat-bots comes to mind)*. 

Perhaps I too am too focused on the word ‘specific’ here, but we just don’t know how AI works on a macro level, just like we don’t know how the neural net of a brain works despite roughly knowing what each section does. 

What would be the golden grail would be to extract and learn that macro level logic. Because if we can, we can also throw out the guesswork, the biases, the testing, etc. We can then refine that extracted algorithm to be adapted on things that are not so easily testable (*you can’t delete “cancerous nodes” if you can’t test for them, yes?)*, and still be confident it is still working properly after. 

Sure, that algorithm wouldn’t be AI anymore, but it is worth knowing, yes? That is a goal worth going after right? This rigid algorithm derived from an organically learned AI?

And that is only one possibility we can learn from within the black box whole that is current AI research. 

But what the other guy did is say “nope, 
 there’s no worth in knowing this, there is none who can do the math for this and it is impossible, don’t even think about perusing any possible knowledge from AI since we know we control all of its mathematical shackles. 

There is no knowledge worth knowing from AI. None at all.” (Despite AI itself being an ongoing, constantly refined field of research)

"As someone who works tangentially with the coffee/agriculture business, I just want to say this is infeasible for future use.

Coffee plantations, where sun-grown crops require a massive amount of soil inputs to keep up production, are incredibly harmful to the environment. Using spent grounds in a cement mix would still be relying on an environmentally destructive industrialization to solve a fundamentally environmental problem.

This is to say nothing of the fact that like 90% of the land that can support coffee (it requires mild/consistent temperature rainforests with bimodal rainfall patterns) will no longer be able to support coffee in the coming decades thanks to climate change.

Also what about the energy they get from the gas the grounds will let out while going through the biochar process as well? Isn’t it also reusable?

"I make biochar out of invasive bamboo. Not only do you the ideal SA:Volume ratio for beneficial mycelia development, you’re getting a side bonus of another element.

Biochar is charcoal minus the binders. When I’m in a pinch-some dude is listing his house and needs 17 $300 fruit trees pulled out-I’ll buy and charge “cowboy lump” from Walmart and soak it for days in fish hydrosylate NOT FISH EMULSION FROM ALASKA brand. 
The key thing is that once you charge it with FH, NOT ALASKA FISH EMULSION, Drain and let it dry in the sun, before adding it to soil or top dress. I use rice hulls for sub soil aeration so the biochar is a top dress. 
Drying in the sun aerates the once anoxic/sub liquid areas, and preps it for microbe life sans liquid immersion. Adding wet charged biochar subsoil is like those parents that throw some newborn in a pool bc *swimming comes natural* and the baby is like WTF?!? The conditions drastically change and the microbes are super sensitive at this point(three day soak doesn’t really populate that many CFU’s). 

*recycle the gas*
I’ve done all day batches and prefer the on off of propane. Quick and easy. It takes some time to get enough gas going to have a smooth burn. I use inputs that are less than 1% moisture so I don’t need a longer time.

"How about we use limestone and volcanic ash like the romans? Their concrete was self-healing due to chunks of limestone in it that would melt over time and actually fill in any cracks that formed with age and use.

This isn’t a solution for everything, but having sturdier concrete that doesn’t wear away after just a few decades would save us tons of materials, work hours, time and greenhouse gas emissions for the future.

"This comment section is going to be the death of me.

Biochar is a technique for carbon sequestration. It uses a process called pyrolysis to lock carbon, that would otherwise leak into the atmosphere through biological composition, into a form that will remain stable and solid for theoretically thousands of years. It is a useful tool in the effort to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gasses, the science is sound, and therefore biochar projects fetch some of the highest prices on the voluntary carbon market. 

The trick is to find uses for the resulting char that make projects more economically viable. Applications should incentivize developers to bear the relatively high capital cost for pyrolysis kilns and incentivize farmers and others with potential feedstocks to spend their time and energy to collect them. Meanwhile, you want to find applications as close to source as possible because transporting diesel trucks full of char all over the place would chip away at biochar’s GHG mitigation benefits. Mixing char into organic fertilizers is one emerging application. So is incorporating it into building materials. A major advantage of both applications is that the “mixing” can happen close to the char’s source AND close to where the end product will be used since agriculture, forestry, coffee consumption, and construction happen everywhere and often close to one another.",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkeVU3cmw2U1ZmcElFczU1LVVLSTI1c2QxcVVPYjBLRURTaDdQWHFFU1VRRlpJa29vb29LZkR3a0REZmwyMkRWQ3Q4MFlwejdOQVRXb0RVcU5wSm93ckE9PQ==

This could be done in L-band. Atmospheric absorption makes a big dip from 1-2 ghz. 

That band used to be used for long-haul point-to-point wide band comms for the military until the band got sold off for commercial use.  Doubt you would need a lot of bandwidth for power transfer so maybe could be slotted in between other users. 

Antennas tend to be big but that might not be a problem if they were embedded in fiberglass and foam wings. 

However (and this shows the usual problem with the egghead DARPA researchers) the transmitter will create a massive arrow pointing right back to its location making it an instant target. If its recharging a stealthy uav then that will make it easier to find.

"First off, ""Jewish Space Laser"" is a terrible name when ""death star of david"" is way better marketing.

Secondly, I thought the issue with the death star of david was that you need nuclear energy to give it enough power to shoot deadly lasers from space, and just paying some guy 50 bucks and giving him some lighter fluid, a rag, and a match would be more stereotypically economical for a would be Jewish arsonist who wants to burn down a forest vs a billion dollar space project. Jewish people are stereotypically frugal, why would they spend billions on a space laser.

The conspiracy theory is antisemitic, but it's also nonsensically antisemitic.

"In the case of Neuralink, I think it’s more of a sunk-cost fallacy and appeasement regarding Musk and the US government, or some other sort of dangerous dynamic that’s related. 

He has already gotten billions and billions of dollars for SpaceX and Starlink, despite catastrophic failures in the former, and him dictating foreign policy via the latter when, for example, HE decided to turn off the Ukrainian military’s ability to control drones as they were literally in mid-air on their way to attack major Russian targets.

The FDA approved human trials for Neuralink implants *after* a series of investigative reporting revealed the dismal failure of the devices in animal testing. Not just failure, but the heartbreaking agony suffered by most of the primates before they finally put them out of their misery. They are reporting that, in the first human subject, a significant number of of the wires in the implant have migrated away from it and are protruding from the scalp. *Which is exactly what happened in the animal testing.* And since these poor animals didn’t understand what was happening to them, they dug and picked at the wires and gouged wounds into their own heads, which became constantly infected, and then the infections spread in their systems and began affecting their kidneys and other organs.

I got sick to my stomach when I read just one or two of the articles that described this testing; I suggest you don’t. These articles also revealed that Neuralink and the lab that conducted the testing are under investigation by the animal welfare group that specifically deals with animals who are the subjects of animal testing, a slew of “regular” animal welfare groups, and Federal agencies from the USDA to the DOT. *And yet,* our government is letting this fucking maniac experiment on human beings.

"Why not one all-purpose blob? Did I ever tell you about the man who taught his asshole to talk? His abdomen would move up and down you dig farting out the words. It was unlike anything I had ever heard. This ass talk had a sort of gut frequency. It hit you right down there like you gotta go. You know when the old colon gives you the elbow and it feels sorta cold inside and you know all you have to do is turn loose? Well this talking hit you right down there, a bubbly, thick stagnant sound, a sound you could smell. This man worked for a carnival you dig, and to start with it was like a novelty ventriloquist act. Real funny, too, at first. He had a number he called ‘The Better ‘Ole’ that was a scream, I tell you. I forget most of it but it was clever. Like, ‘Oh, I say, are you still down there old thing?’ ‘Nah! I had to go relieve myself.’ After a while the ass started talking on its own. He would go in without anything prepared and his ass would ad-lib and toss the gags back at him every time. Then it developed sort of teeth-like little raspy incurving hooks and started eating. He thought this was cute at first and built an act around it, but the asshole would eat its way through his pants and start talking on the street, shouting out it wanted equal rights. It would get drunk, too, and have crying jags nobody loved it and it wanted to be kissed the same as any other mouth. Finally it talked all the time day and night, you could hear him for blocks screaming at it to shut up, and beating it with his fist, and sticking candles up it, but nothing did any good and the asshole said to him: ‘It’s you who will shut up in the end. Not me. Because we don’t need you around here any more. I can talk and eat and shit. After that he began waking up in the morning with a transparent jelly like a tadpole’s tail all over his mouth. This jelly was what the scientists call un-D.T., Undifferentiated Tissue, which can grow into any kind of flesh on the human body. He would tear it off his mouth and the pieces would stick to his hands like burning gasoline jelly and grow there, grow anywhere on him a glob of it fell. So finally his mouth sealed over, and the whole head would have amputated spontaneous – (did you know there is a condition occurs in parts of Africa where the little toe amputates spontaneously?) – except for the eyes, you dig. That’s one thing the asshole couldn’t do was see. It needed the eyes. But nerve connections were blocked and infiltrated and atrophied so the brain couldn’t give orders any more. It was trapped in the skull, sealed off. For a while you could see the silent, helpless suffering of the brain behind the eyes, then finally the brain must have died because the eyes just went out, and there was no more feeling in them than a crab’s eye on the end of a stalk.",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmN2RLanRaYk1qM01yZ1ZGd1JCcVB5WW5Qbm5PY0V4T0xyUGdjTFRaSkNsWDRnbm9adldBSFN6Z1hrbFphZlU1TEtLc0d3U1dVX09wWUl4UmJOMXc0TWc9PQ==

"Don't worry. I'm sure even with this, there would be plenty of business remaining for orthodontics, even if we can regrow teeth. For example, just because you can grow a tooth doesn't mean you can precisely control where and how it grows. If a tooth grows too large, it may need to be carved back to a shape compatible with the existing teeth. If it doesn't grow large enough, a topping crown may still be needed.

"Do you know any of the specifics of this? All I can seem to find is that it's a tooth regrowth treatment. But I don't know if it's like a shot that's you get in the arm that will make you grow a new set of teeth, or grow missing teeth, or if it's a topical treatment. If it was a topical treatment, then maybe it could work well. As a dentist you inject the drug into the right spot for the tooth to form. Then it grows in. It won't grow in the perfect shape or in the perfect location, but those can be fixed. If the location is off, you adjust with braces. If it's too large for the other teeth around it, you grind it to fit. If it's too small, you add a crown. 

Or, if the tech got good enough, for really advanced cases, you might just pull all of someone's teeth and grow them a whole new set.

"Having recently had to have a crown followed by wisdom tooth extraction, I feel I can confidently say that extraction+regrowth is NOT likely to replace crowns or even root canals.

With crowns, you're fine the next day outside a bit of soreness. With tooth extraction, you're looking at weeks of recovery time... and presumably even longer than that while you have to care for the site as the new tooth slowly grows and erupts. You have to obsessively keep things clean, can't eat normal food for ages, run the risk of dry socket... it's not a good time. Tooth extraction is also a much more traumatic experience emotionally.

I've never had a root canal, though unfortunately I may need one soon (the molar I had the crown on, which was very impacted by my wisdom teeth, is still iffy. It's been a saga). I've talked to my dentist a lot about what that would look like, and frankly, while I don't love it the procedure and recovery genuinely sounds not so bad. I would DEFINITELY, 100%, no hesitation from a patient standpoint take a root canal over another tooth extraction.

I think it's fair to say that this would primarily be useful at the point that you got to needing an extraction today, and would mostly impact bridges and dentures.

Now, on the other hand, if the tooth grew in like a new adult tooth replacing a baby tooth and the old one slowly became loose and fell out and we didn't have to do a surgical extraction...

"> Could you go into what you're thinking about when you say it might replace root canals?

The purpose of a root canal is essentially the elimination of the nerve. If the option is there to regrow a tooth so you can both eliminate the infection and maintain the nerve, I see it as a possibility.

Enamel production stops roughly by age 8. There are already conditions that are caused by enamel not being produced when the teeth are originally growing. So it appears as though tooth growth and enamel production are distinct mechanisms. So I wouldn't make any assumptions about the ability of growing a tooth automatically meaning enamel production.",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmN0sxM2tNNWg1TFlaZjJNOVg3bDJ4ejBPOVFSaHJleU8wc29rTVU3S0s3XzkzTE9RVXpqdDRDdnpGTmkxZmFCNkpybXZJckV1eVctOEFJcjl4bDhhNXc9PQ==

"The nerve is inside the tooth, though? Extracting the tooth extracts the nerve inside it, since it's all part and parcel. A new tooth would need to grow a new nerve. A root canal just hollows out the nerve in the tooth and fills any abscessed area below it. 

Enamel production is part of the overall tooth growth process. The reason most* enamel production stops around age 8 is because the adult teeth have their enamel already but haven't erupted. Sure, the tooth growth process can have an error where the enamel isn't produced, but it's not like you're constantly producing new enamel on existing teeth up until then. Your primary, childhood teeth aren't repairing their enamel up until then - it's just that your permanent teeth are still developing their crowns below the gumline in your jaw. Also, I'm just going to go out on a limb and say it's unlikely they'd get approved for human trials if the tooth they were growing had no enamel and were going to be completely fucked up. 

*enamel production actually continues longer, technically, since it is still forming on the wisdom teeth after this age. That can continue until around age 16 or so.

"I remember seeing this a while back. It can enable you to do tasks that are either extremely difficult or outright impossible to do with one hand; for instance, opening a water bottle with only a single hand. Unless you’re bracing it on your knee or something, it’s almost impossible to both grasp the bottle and use your finger and thumb to unscrew the cap. However, if you have a second thumb, one can be used for holding the bottle along with three other fingers, while your index finger and normal thumb can unscrew the cap.

"So does getting bone grafts and screws for implants. And then the healing process for that. Then the implants. Then the going back a couple of times when rhe implants break.

(Source: Anecdotal. Just watching my dad get implants. Took two years, $40,000 & a shitload of pain. And he is one of the lucky ones. We literally have several dentists in the family so everything was at a discount. Not that he needed it. He was and is financially well off. Just luck, I suppose that ended up in him needing 3 tries before being happy with the set he has. 

Root canals and extractions are also painful. Had to have my wisdom teeth extracted as they were growing in sideways. One of them went pretty bad. Again luck. Otherwise it's pretty good for me so far concerning the rest of my teeth. Oh, and one friend had a bad, painful experience with a root canal.

So I know it happens. Have no idea about the statistical incidence however which is probably what you need to truly consider while comparing.)

In my experience understanding there are no defined orbitals. This is not Newton’s law of planetary mechanics. Instead the electron is a quantum particle acting as a wave function interacting with the atomic core in such a way that the probability to manifest itself inside the core is highly unlikely. Sharing the waves of multiple electrons between atoms creates bindings. The interactions of multiple electron wave functions creates patterns aka electron shell model.,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJscThiemk0QXFPUjFnSTBhR3pSU3hjSEZjWUFsQkxfcm9LV3dhYThScXFTaW1fVTlReVpXa3ZYdHBubS1rRlN2MHBJRkFyU2RrTlR2djUxS3BkOXVzMXdIMHNIYmFTRXlPWGRhbXBuSHp5SGM9

"I think all those things will still be needed, especially RCs and crowns. RC is done to clean out infection and then a crown to cap it off. 

If this drug was a success though…I wonder if a full extraction would be the standard instead of attempting to save the tooth with RCT and let the tooth regrow with the drug? 

But then another thing arises that to ensure the tooth grows properly, you may need to wear some sort of brace? And also a temporary implant to make sure the gap is sufficient enough.

"~~It’s not the thawing that destroys the cells— it’s not being frozen fast enough.~~ Slow freezing cause the ice crystals to form in jagged shapes, and of course ice slightly expands. These two factors cause tons of tiny punctures to the cell walls.

Flash freezing prevents the ice crystals from forming jagged shapes (or at least, they are very small), which leads to minimal damage to the cells.

"""death"" isn't defined well. Legally you have to be pronounced dead before freezing I think. But your brain is still fully alive for a few minutes, longer if they allow pre-cooling.

Our clients would create trusts to continue to pay Alcor after their “freezing”, so that their remains could continue to be maintained. And THEN- because these were very wealthy people- their remaining assets would be tied up in other trusts and charitable foundations, with ongoing wealth management- so that they could reclaim their wealth upon reanimation.

"It’s not happening in 100 years. Even with an insane tech boom, the field of medicine is gonna take WAYYYY longer to apply that tech in a way that allows them to reverse clinical death.

And make no mistake, all these people who are cryogenically frozen are DEAD dead. This isn’t a videogame where being frozen like that lets you be revived in 1000 years. Brain cells start dying VERY rapidly once you have a lack of oxygen. Unless the person dies IN the cryogenic chamber and they’re frozen INSTANTLY EXACTLY at the moment of death, (which is not how cryogenics happens) they’re just plain dead. 4 minutes of having your heart stop will already lead to brain damage, and the longer you go past thay the more irreperable it becomes. Too many brain cells will die to ever even consider attempting reanimation.

So all the cryogenically frozen “people” are actually just frozen corpses that can never be reanimated.

The company the stores them will eventually go out of business and those corpses will just be given back to the families for burial or cremation.

Not saying it can never be done in the future. But that’s gonna be long after all people living today are gone. None of the currently frozen people will ever be brought back.",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtRFlhOU5CY1pXUXA3c2VBdTdJcjV5QTVhWWY2WUx1VkdTTmkwdnpJYms1S1Fydm0wcmZreXh2NDVaNGFSdzJIeGxvcUc3T1JuNTV6NXRPWWozOWo3VVE9PQ==

"Taking down a botnet is massive. Absolutely massive. They are distributed and non centralized and so you cant just walking into the room with the server and flip the switch off. They are spread across thousands of computers all over the world and they don’t care if you take down like 10% of the nodes, the other 90% will continue to work. 

So to take down an entire network is tough. You need to secure the credentials, and work out how to deactivate it. Know the topology of it, have access to the source code. Obviously if you’re clever you can probably get around some of that but it’s still a lot. And then you have to deploy some kind of neutralization which would be a pretty highly technical thing.

I’m also not arguing that philosophy shouldn’t consider it or that it won’t ever be scientifically observable, but as it stands with our modern understanding, consciousness does reside within the brain.

"> one of the design’s most promising features resides in what may initially sound like a flaw—only a small portion of the light is focused into a point, while most of it passes unaffected through the lens. As study co-author Jorik van de Groep explains, however, this could actually become a major advantage. “The lens can be used in applications where the view through the lens should not be disturbed, but a small part of the light can be tapped to collect information,” he said in an accompanying statement. “This makes it perfect for wearable glasses such as for augmented reality.”

"Eh, not really. While the human body doesn't produce a lot of electrical power, it comes pretty cheaply and consistently. You only have to provide water and a few nutrients to keep humans producing electricity for a very long time. The pods systems as shown in the film had few moving parts and would presumably run indefinitely by simply changing out your humans every 60 or so years. Since the planet had been decimated by war, solar power was out, wind power was likely unpredictable, leaving only geothermal as a consistent and easy to tap power source. (Presuming fossil fuels had been exhausted.) Since geothermal isn't really available everywhere on the planet, human farms are a relatively reasonable source of power. 

Using humans as a CPU presumes you can control the human brain to do what you want it to do, which the entire movie shows is not possible.

"This. I scrolled to through every comment here and the last one finally addresses the root cause. I frequently have patients “brag” to me about their bionic joints or stents or whatever… I cringe hard because so much of this is just from obesity. We don’t need to keep reinventing expensive implants so that companies with their reps can make more money.

We do these procedures because we overeat calories. I don’t know the exact percentage, maybe an orthopod can chime in. Probably 80% of knee replacements wouldn’t have to happen if we could just eat a reasonable number of calories. 

We complain about expensive health care in USA, but we don’t question subsidizing $60,000 surgeries that are mostly avoidable. It doesn’t make sense for healthy weight/non-smokers to pay the same for insurance as people who chose dangerous lifestyles.

Vote for u/solodolo in 2024, I would: 

Make generic blood pressure pills, insulin, and diabetes pills FREE for all Americans. Create a modest “obesity health insurance” tax starting three years from now. These changes alone would reduce knee replacements, coronary artery disease interventions, dialysis/ESRD, etc immensely. It would probably pay for itself 20x over within a decade.

Worked on this in college back in 2016! Was fascinating stuff really. The idea then at least was that you could 3D print a bio-scaffold with nutrient rich growth media and then plant the recipients cartilage stem cells onto it where they would consume/replace the structure as they proliferated. Once fully developed you would essentially have a cartilage plug you could implant into the joint replacing old worn out cartilage and giving the patient a *new* knee/elbow/hip etc.,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvYnlKa3VES0JINk9XOTI0ZGdTUkRDVGJ3YWJLM1BWTV9nX2F5U0xSS1h1MXEybmxJR3l3SUZzdVU3M2c2VEoxN1NGZnZFQlRhSDJoTVRnMGdHYW5feUE9PQ==

"I see you getting downvoted.  I was once like you friend. Until we got one.  Always something to do when you have a hot tub.  Sit out on an early morning. Watch the deer walk by.  Star gazing and watching for meteors.  Set up a tv and watch it from the hot tub.  Late night conversations with your partner.  In this busy rat race of a life you have to have micro-vacations to unwind fast. It’s hard to be stressed when you change your environment that quick.

We drained and cleaned the hot tub probably every 3 months more if we had guests over partying in it, ie. spilling booze. Then we drained it. And chemicals and ozanators in between.

The nuclear plant they built in the UAE is 4x1GW and each reactor took just below the global average construction time, so they were added to the grid after less than 9 years.

This solar project took a few days less than 2 years to complete.

The actual GWh/year of construction for this project is slightly below that of the global average construction time for power plants.

That obviously doesn't account for the re-construction required for this plant in 20-25 years. Over the lifetime of the nuclear plant it'd probably need to be re-constructed at least once, and realistically it doesn't hold up without the construction of storage.

I also think solar & wind are great, but they are only more economical so long as they are a smaller part of the energy mix. As soon as we reach a threshold where they produce more energy than we need, in a small period of time, then they stop being cheap.

Beyond that we need energy storage, and as soon as that's thrown in the mix then solar becomes the single most expensive form of energy we have available.

Wind fares better due to being able to produce at any point in the day, but no matter how hard we try we're not going to get solar production up and running at 11pm.

The [Windows Recall system](https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-recall-alternatives/) takes screenshots of your activity every five seconds and saves them on the device. But security experts say that data may not stay there for long.

Two weeks ahead of [Recall’s launch on new Copilot+ PCs on June 18](https://www.wired.com/story/everything-announced-microsoft-surface-event-2024/), security researchers have demonstrated how preview versions of the tool store the screenshots in an unencrypted database. The researchers say the data could easily be hoovered up by an attacker. And now, in a warning about how Recall could be abused by criminal hackers, Alex Hagenah, a cybersecurity strategist and ethical hacker, has released a demo tool that can automatically extract and display everything Recall records on a laptop.

"Probably highly depends on the location. On extremely remote areas or in place with no road, it might be cheaper than trucking, but then its not cheap, its just cheaper than trucking in water. What we want is a tech that can be universally used and is cheaper than current solutions. It seems like all current solutions either require large amount of infrastructure or require a lot of power. Both of those reasons are why there is no water in the first place, as there exist places that are as dry as that, but have running tap water thanks to desalination plants.

"The inertial sensors that you got on your phone are MEMS: basically tiny tiny bridges that are resonating applying current. Depending on how much force they feel, they vibrate at one frequency or another, telling you in which direction and with which quantity (magnitude) they are feeling the force.

They are not suited for high speed, high accuracy navigation because these applications need more bandwidth (I.e. faster sampling rate) and accuracy (MEMS tend to “drift”, thinking they are feeling a tiny little more amount of force than they do, which over time makes the whole thing think they have moved from the current position when they really didn’t).

This company introduces an optical part to that sensor. I couldn’t find in the article if they are using interferometry or which technique exactly, but it makes them 10 times more accurate and 10 times faster, which makes them “probably” suitable for autonomous navigation.

Fun fact: because helium is so tiny it penetrates between the plastic and the exposed wires, if you find yourself in a helium environment the gas will penetrate into the chip and substitute the normal air where the bridge is vibrating, making it think that it feels different forces. It also happens with oscillators keeping time on your device.",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2eHY3OVlSQlg1RFN1ZGgxYzZpbUtlWW5RS0hmWldZQ09PWnNIOGhDRFA1bjhaLUJqMnRLcUtzS0lHbkJMWnN2Mm1IU0ZsUVRMY3JESVZGMXdjSlVqcGc9PQ==

Water is a basic necessity of life just to live, let alone work, you don’t have an economy without people who can work and create an economy.

"From the article: Chinese scientists have achieved a technological breakthrough with the development of a three-dimensional (3D) architected electronic skin. First reported by Xinhua News Agency, this innovation can be applied directly to the skin like a band-aid.

This can be used to monitor real-time health data of people with potential applications in biomedical diagnosis and humanoid robots.  A brainchild of Professor Zhang Yihui from Tsinghua University, the electronic skin is capable of decoding and sensing three mechanical signals: pressure, friction, and strain. 

Electronic skin mimics the sensory functions of human skin
Talking about the development, Professor Zhang revealed that electronic skin is a novel type of sensor that mimics the sensory functions of human skin.

“In the future, it can be installed on the fingertips of medical robots for early diagnosis and treatment, and can also be applied like a band-aid to human skin to monitor health data such as blood oxygen and heart rate in real-time,” he explained. 

The electronic skin “has a lot of tactile receptor cells that are densely arranged and have a three-dimensional spatial distribution, which can accurately perceive external stimuli,” he further added. 

The simultaneous decoding of pressure, friction, and strain signals presented a significant challenge in the development of this technology. The new electronic skin overcomes this hurdle with a structure mimicking human skin, comprising epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue.",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2SHhUVDM5SHJqUHkyMG4wcHhGZlJRVVZXS2lVTmRXVlQ2N2lwV2EySjZTTjV1c0tVbUdrbTRuQWZsOFVFSzhlei1nd3dkRU1wdzk1M1Y5QXp2VU5qOWc9PQ==

"The problem is you need relative moisture to pull out of the air. Either you live near water and this thing pulls the evaporated water out of the air, or maybe you get a little after rain, but otherwise you have dry air and there is no moisture to pull.

There is no tech that breaks physics, without a thousand researchers scrambling to verify and succeeding or failing. And succeeding makes waves in even normie media. The thing people always forget to mention with these “like magic” techs; the water does actually have to come from somewhere.

“Water” won’t be in the air if there is no body of water near by, evaporating. Now, could this work in areas that have large amounts of undrinkable water, and high humidity? Probably, it’s just a dehumidifier, and ideally it is actually efficient, but [you can already buy little plastic boxes that do this with zero energy input.](https://www.woolworths.com.au/shop/productdetails/251846/damprid-moisture-absorber-refillable) But the “magic” camp always advertise it disingenuously. The Life Straw is a much better, cheaper, and proven way to drink “undrinkable water”. A dehumidifier will do nothing in an arid area, no matter how efficient it is.

"To be fair, most HVAC professionals I have encountered don’t understand Coefficient of Performance either.

An extra $200 on a $14,000 17 SEER 5 ton system. In Palm Beach County Florida. She would have saved that $200 back inside a year. The COP on that bad boy is above 2.5 on the coldest day of the year at that house.

Electric resistance heating is the second most expensive way to heat that there is, beaten only by “a bonfire made of cash.”

"I’m guessing most people can’t get their head around how you can put energy into a system and get more out. Basically you cant. 
But heat pumps move energy around.
Most people understand how a fridge moves energy from inside (cools) and cools dumps the excess heat out the back via the radiator coils.
This is exactly that. Electricity is used to move energy from one source and dump that heat into another. In the energy equation the cold/hot sources balance out. I.e you take 2KJ of energy out of the water and it get colder, push it to air and it get 2KJ hotter.

The technology behind the efficiency is that I have 3 -100 ft deep wells that the glycol mixture circulates through via loops that feed back to the unit.

Based on what research have you made this preposterous allegation?  I happen to work in this sector.  Climeworks is a “competitor.”  In the direct air capture space though we all sort of root for each other.  The cost of direct air CO2 capture is still too high but it is dropping quite fast.  There will be a point at which direct air CO2 capture will approach the value of industrial CO2.  It will certainly approach the planet and human health costs well before that.

Negative. Old growth forest like floridas oak trees in northern Florida grabs more carbon than younger trees. More leaves and root mass pulls more from the air and into the ground.

"You can capture it, but that’s just half the problem. Where do you store all that CO2? The carbon dioxide excess is around 0.01% of our atmosphere. That’s a LOT. 

“Underground” isn’t an answer, unfortunately. The volume of empty reservoirs and mines available for storage is a fraction of the volume we need. 

What we really need is a cheap way to turn this concentrated co2 into carbon, which we can then store.

I think the most realistic way to go about this is to capture co2 at the source - like at steel mills and smelters that use carbon as a reductant - and reuse the capture. Add biological carbon, like wood chips (commonly used for ferroalloys, for instance), and you’ll have excess carbon you can store. And you also have an economic incentive, which helps smooth things along.

"Just to offset the carbon released by the existing 2'500 coal power plants, you'd need 15'000 Megaton carbon capture plants like the one they are planning, or over 400'000 of the smaller ones they already have. 

I'm not sure why everyone else has such small numbers. I think it's because they're only counting the carbon that needs to be captured to offset the future growth of carbon emissions, or something like that. 

But that changes the narritive a lot, doesn't it. It's not building 10s of thausands plants to offset carbon emissions. That's the massive number of infrastructure you need just to slow or stabilize global warming at the current high level. 

To capture just the output of  a single gigawatt coal power station, you need 10 megaton carbon capture plants. That's ridiculous. Just replacing the coal fired plant with rewnewables is going to be orders of magnitudes cheaper

"There is still a major problem though thermodynamically speaking- it is exceptionally hard and expensive to take CO2 gas from the atmosphere and turn it into anything else(solid, liquid, compressed gas). Something on the order of magnitude of at least the same amount of energy you gained from burning the fuel which released that CO2 in the first place. 

Basically, we will have to offset all of our current energy sources that produce CO2 with at minimum an equivalent amount(in energetic production) of infrastructure dedicated to powering carbon capture systems to hit net zero. This does nothing to address legacy Carbon which was there before these systems were constructed, that would require additional energy production solely dedicated to such facilities. 

It’s a difficult problem because of the basic thermodynamic reality of taking a ppm concentration gas from a complex and uneven mixture- and storing it as either a pure, compressed gas; or compressing it into a pure liquid or solid form. It’s going to require a significant amount of energy infrastructure which will not give tangible observable benefits to people for decades, as the goal is not only net zero, but reducing the amount we’ve already put in the atmosphere- the energy made by the facilities is dedicated to an uneconomical task. 

My personal bet is that it’s going to require significant political will for this infrastructure to be built at the scale required to begin to reverse the influx of CO2 into the atmosphere caused by human activity. I’m willing to bet that this political will won’t be present for another few decades, a large chunk of people are stubborn and don’t want their tax dollars going to something they can’t see any benefits of- it will likely take a significant migrant crisis in much of the developed world, with mass graves needing to be dug for victims of extreme inclement weather caused climate change for there to be the political will necessary to do anything substantial about it.",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4eVg4VS1udDlaaUluMEZXeHNpTldBWkc4N2wwNzNPT0Fual9QSmd1RzlFQUIxcDllNzRlTHpQaGw4eTc2TTFvM3Y4UVR0TW54ZzhzWEVOMWMzcFNoblE9PQ==
"The world has [greater than 10,000 Gt](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/the-world-has-vast-capacity-to-store-co2-net-zero-means-we-ll-need-it) of CO2 storage capacity underground. Some of this is in the form of depleted oil and gas fields but the vast majority is in saline aquifers.

This is far in excess of the amount of CO2 we might need to store. In the 2010s the world emitted [an estimated 560 GtCO2eq](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_SPM.pdf), most of which was from CO2 but methane and refrigerants also contributed significantly, so the amount of CO2 is more in the ballpark of 400 Gt. If we continued to emit CO2 at the current rate we could potentially store it in geological formations for two and half centuries. That said, we don’t expect our emissions to remain at this rate due to other decarbonisation efforts like renewable electrification which allow for a rapid reduction in emissions. The IEA’s sustainable development scenario estimated that we would [need to store ~220 Gt of CO2](https://www.iea.org/reports/ccus-in-clean-energy-transitions/ccus-in-the-transition-to-net-zero-emissions) over the next fifty years, though the actual number may end up being higher depending on the path the world takes (but still well within the storage budget).

"I think the oldest ones did. When you saw those ones with an element in the middle supported by springs around them they basically worked that way. We don't really use that sort anymore.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone#Piezoelectric

In that setup the springs are like the web but only are a suspension, they are not the pickup (sensor). Maybe they are thinking of if the springs were replaced with piezoelectric filaments it would be more like a spider web.

I don't think that would be that useful as a ""regular microphone"" because we generally want control over directionality with a microphone. We want, in essence, a lack of sensitivity in some directions.

But if you wanted to have a huge sensor and so high sensitivity then maybe the web would be the trick.

"**From the article:**

In January 2022, NASA’s $10 billion James Webb Space Telescope was approaching the end of its one-million-mile trip from Earth. But reaching its orbital spot would be just one part of its treacherous journey. To ready itself for observations, the spacecraft had to unfold itself in a complicated choreography that, according to its engineers’ calculations, had 344 different ways to fail. A sunshield the size of a tennis court had to deploy exactly right, ending up like a giant shiny kite beneath the telescope. A secondary mirror had to swing down into the perfect position, relying on three legs to hold it nearly 25 feet from the main mirror. 

Finally, that main mirror—its 18 hexagonal pieces nestled together as in a honeycomb—had to assemble itself. Three golden mirror segments had to unfold from each side of the telescope, notching their edges against the 12 already fitted together. The sequence had to go perfectly for the telescope to work as intended.

“That was a scary time,” says Karen Casey, a technical director for Raytheon’s Air and Space Defense Systems business, which built the software that controls JWST’s movements and is now in charge of its flight operations. 

Over the multiple days of choreography, engineers at Raytheon watched the events unfold as the telescope did. The telescope, beyond the moon’s orbit, was way too distant to be visible, even with powerful instruments. But the telescope was feeding data back to Earth in real time, and software near-simultaneously used that data to render a 3D video of how the process was going, as it was going. It was like watching a very nerve-racking movie.

The 3D video represented a “digital twin” of the complex telescope: a computer-based model of the actual instrument, based on information that the instrument provided. “This was just transformative—to be able to see it,” Casey says.",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5NzVsc2tLSmdjbTFJVXpwY0lOVEJEc0pfaWpudmF0OThEQllkbmxzanZuQTFKZWxuRm1ZaFFNZGxXQTRhNVNJYVNvb0VFMlc5bFJ1TkxTOE1KeC1ZY1E9PQ==
"The battery they're contrasting this one with, Natron energy's product, uses abundant manganese and an iron compound called [prussian blue](https://natron.energy/our-technology).  Prussian blue is widely used as a pigment, and it is safe enough that it is used internally as a medicine to absorb poisonous heavy metals.  Other sodium battery makers are using a similar compound, Prussian white, as both the anode and cathode.

CATL is probably the most mature sodium battery, they use Prussian white as an anode and ""hard carbon"" (graphite?) as the cathode.

Lithium batteries are very light, because lithium is the lightest solid element, so they may always have a role in vehicles, but sodium batteries are going to be huge for stationary storage.  Fortunately, the machines that make the basic ""jelly roll"" cell are adaptable to either.  It wouldn't be cheap to turn one type of battery factory into the other but it is far from impossible.",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5TjNyS1JWbVpENlJYRDc4RkZ6S05fcUdCZVV3ZlJUelVWeExtOU9fUmRqUmhKTk5zMjFqaHkzYTJxWnU0aTBwMW1adExCcldtOE11U3BCM0d1QWo0c2c9PQ==

"You've pretty much got it. 

The general process is just carbonization aka heating up a carbon based material to really high temps in an atmosphere void of oxygen (typically nitrogen or argon). The end result you just crush up and mix it into your electrode slurry for use as the active material. 

Just about any form of carbon will work for the anode. Some are better or worse than others, and this is due to the other additives that come naturally from your base material choice. Commercially mcmb is used a lot. 

I did research into this sort of stuff during my undergrad for li ion, and we had used this process for a wide range of things from powders to use in electrodes (soybeans and corn husks also work well for this), graphene production (was a whole can of worms), and making flexible mats for the electrode.

A tool like this could join those other techniques in situations like quality control of manufactured items; inspection of machinery and installed equipment; security inspection of parcels and mail; examination of historical artifacts; locating studs, wires, pipes etc. without damaging wallpaper or plasterboard; possibly imaging things beneath the skin for medical purposes... there's a lot of possible uses. Of course, there are also nefarious applications - for one, I just mentioned inspecting mail, but of course it could also let anyone who handled your mail read its contents - which is a criminal offence in many places - and do so undetectably and without actually opening it.

"Civil engineering perspective: This is an interesting innovation, but it has a long ways to go before it is actually viable. 

This is considering a mixture of water, cement, and their special conductive ingredient. This mixture is not concrete. It is mortar. It has no real weight bearing capacity. And at that, they mention it is slightly weaker than regular mortar. 

I would venture to guess that by the time the aggregate, sand, cement, and their additive is together it will either be too weak as a material structurally, or not conductive enough. It will also need to go through extensive testing and long term testing to know the efficacy. Does it degrade over time? Does it create a byproduct? What is the efficiency over time? 

All of these things are possible to work through, but it will be years before it is acceptable in county, state, and federal building standards.

"Their numbers sound impossible. CO2 is mixed all trough our atmosphere in a conentration of 500mmp. So 0.05% so even if they could somehow capture 100% of the co2 that is in the i take air (something they cant do) they would need to process 2000 m3 of air to capture 1m3 of carbon dioxide, would be a little under 4 pounds. Or less than 1/4 of the emissions of a single galon of gasoline being burned. 

So for every gallon of fuel burned in the US it would need to filter a cube of air that is 66 by 66 by 66 feet if the machine worked perfectly at a theoretical maximum. 

A fan that moves 2000m2 of air an hour would consume about 750w (souce: https://www.teka.eu/en/Fan-2000-m3-h/9610123). 
750w the current US average emissions for electricity are 0.86 pound for 1kwh. So moving the air that contains the CO2 alone will emit 0.65 pounds before getting into the energy intensive part of capturing it yet. 

**A lot of these “direct air capture” plants don’t take their own construction or energy use into account when making these claims** they are often funded by companies who would stand to lose a lot when we move away from fossil fuels so they are trying to make it look like this is a possible solution while it really is not.

"Not really. Shellfishing (at least in the northeast U.S.) is an extremely sustainable fishery. Shells are a byproduct of the fishery, so often they’re used in crushed shell driveways, or other aggregate settings. It’s also a renewable resource and does not degrade the environment, which the alternative, mining for rocks DOES.  So if there is a pivot towards using shells instead of rocks then concrete would be more sustainable.

"The odd thing is that although new cement technology exists which reduce the carbon imprint and is stronger but won’t be widely used for probably >20 years.

Cement industry is one of the top two industry polluters of CO2: currently 900 kg of CO2 are emitted for every ton of cement. New mixes have been created which fix this pollution problem. But building designers/builders are hesitant to use the new concretes because most builders require a “proven product” which usually means has been widely used for 10+ years. And the new proprietary concretes are expensive because not widely used. So a catch-22 where we need more use of the better concrete but we won’t because don’t want the liability of an ‘unproven’ product and don’t want the additional expense. Frustrating for all.

For a long time, researchers thought that the durability of ancient concrete was due to one ingredient: pozzolanic material, originating from the Pozzuoli area of Naples. Upon closer inspection, the study team, led by MIT, and including researchers from the United States, Italy and Switzerland, found that these ancient samples also contained small white chunks called ‘lime clasts’, long known to be a ubiquitous component of Roman concrete. ‘Ever since I first began working with ancient Roman concrete, I’ve always been fascinated by these features,’ says MIT professor of civil and environmental engineering Admir Masic. ‘These are not found in modern concrete formulations, so why are they present in these ancient materials?’

 

Previously, the white lumps had been overlooked as evidence of messy mixing practices or low-quality raw materials. However, the new study suggests that these tiny lumps are what gave the concrete a self-healing ability.‘",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1M21WVEV1Z0FiUDlYMzZqSjVPUzVRdWE1ZlhHZXJXc1UwOExJMUc3RzFhUE00SGVfVHpMVG1yVzRkRkp0b054Q0c3WkdBWXNUMUJQODJEekpvQkRiYmc9PQ==

It has some drawbacks for sure, early strength is much lower and takes a few days to catch up or lots of costly admix accelerant (not to mention the cement is more expensive despite being cheaper to make - probably some price collusion reason).

"Sorry, the comment came off more aggressive than I wanted. Anyway, here a few points:

- “better concrete” is a very simplistic term and should not be used unless you specified exactly what a concrete is better at. Compressive strength? Chloride diffusion coefficient? Sulfate attack resistance?

- more sustainable concrete is not necessarily stronger (let’s say in compression) than traditional concrete

- more sustainable cements are being rolled out all over the US in the form of blended cements, where part of the clinker is being replaced by either limestone or by an SCM. So changes are already happening and won’t take decades

- unfortunately hesitation in adopting more sustainable concrete is not only driven by the need of case studies with new techs. But many other properties contribute to the choice of one concrete over another: e.g. early age strength, workability, finishability, durability etc.

- there is no technology today that is scalable and completely replace the clinker we use in modern construction. So the best thing that analysts expect is the introduction of carbon capture and storage in about 15+ years

"The selective electrocatalytic hydrogenation of organics with transition metal hydrides is a promising strategy for electrosynthesis and energy storage. We report the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of acetone with a cyclopentadienone-iridium complex in a tandem electrocatalytic cycle with a cobaltocene mediator. The reductive protonation of cobaltocenium with mild acids generates (C5H5)CoI(C5H6) (CpCoI(CpH)), which functions as an electrocatalytic hydride mediator to deliver a hydride to cationic Ir(III) without generating hydrogen. Electrocatalytic hydride transfer by CpCoI(CpH) to a cationic Ir species leads to the efficient (Faradaic efficiency > 90%) electrohydrogenation of acetone, a valuable hydrogenation target as a liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC). Hydride–transfer mediation presents a powerful strategy to generate metal hydrides that are inaccessible by stepwise electron/proton transfer.",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2TlZpX1cyUmZ0UEVDYVBfcDRXYkRCUzNkclJnN2psVHMyc2FQdkJmbTJnaVlzVVNuUWJ5dHFvNGxBaVpDaVlPU1F1MDBRZ1l1cWNMMlpLZHZiVUVXUW5BMHd6aGpUY0pScEpuNTFidlFzSE09

"That's a reasonable criticism of at least the *headline*.

However, ""car battery"" is overly-specific. The water in big lead-acid batteries is easy to notice, because you can sometimes hear it sloshing when you move the battery, and because (on the vented types) you actually have to top up the water.

But almost all batteries in current use involve electrolytes dissolved in a solvent (which may or may not be water, depending on the chemistry used). It's just a bit less noticeable when 1. they're totally sealed and 2. the liquid is contained in something like a paste or a roll of wet paper, instead of big sloshing tank.

So what *does* make the thing in this article different from existing liquid batteries? Quite simply, it's that they're not really talking about a battery, as the term is normally understood. When this article say ""liquid battery"", it's just talking about a fuel tank.

This is part of a trend in journalism that's been going on as long as the hydrogen economy hype has. Since a fuel cell converts chemical energy to electrical energy, the combination of a fuel cell and a fuel tank gets referred to as a ""battery"".",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2cTQzREwtRHVHcXVhSDUxb3Roclk3TU1jZUZpb3JXV3RXS0JmeDlQRkZucUdKNzVMWkxhSFJWZGVEdFRNOVZqdGdRczVYc0ppV2JiZXFIZWhDdWltdHc9PQ==

"These are literally just CEM I/II/III types of mixes where a part of Portland cement is replaced with supplementary cementitious materials (like BFS or Fly ash) - in this case PLC with limestone. The vast majority of the binder mix is still portland cement. I wouldn't call PLC green cement any more than I would call CEM I/II/III green. I think CEM III requires only 5 % Portland cement as an example.

For SCMs utilizing BFS or Fly ash the more you add, the slower the activation until you arrive at a point where it simply is too slow to fit into any reasonably concrete workflow. Instead of having to wait 28D for full compressive strength you have to wait 56 days. That's where the activators come into play, but they are not cheap and fairly significant amounts of them are required, as opposed to admixtures which are just small additions. Additionally the exact composition and amount of activator can be very specific, so just coming up with a recipe that works requires R&D that is way beyond the means of any typical concrete factory.",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2d3VGZ1pyNDhadV8wN2tIWkZIbWNBdlg4bXlaY3FvZnAwRlVYVzJPZTF1VWM5X3RzeHZONldCclMyMTZGUVJmOEVMVk4zdXJqRzJpWWF2V1RCSHY4OWc9PQ==

Princeton’s team found that alternating thin polymer and patterned cement paste layers can greatly improve ductility—the capacity to flex without breaking.

The group drew inspiration for their work on creating materials from biology. In this instance, the group created a composite modeled after nacre, a naturally occurring substance that may be found inside specific shells. 
According to researchers, nacre comprises of hexagon-shaped tablets of the hard mineral aragonite joined together at the microscopic level by a soft biopolymer. Its 3D brick-and-mortar structure allows the tablets to slide and the biopolymer to deform, absorbing energy and enhancing toughness. 
These mechanisms, along with nano-asperities and tablet interlocking, make nacre resilient despite its brittle components.",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2dFU2eXowYThPbTdwVXhNN01uTVRGTDlQLXRubWVSU2owSnhwTzlQcHVFU3ZfT1RxNE1GY1dqZHV6WEROM0Y4OGtyc3BqLThjSkFyWE5ybnMtQzNCN2c9PQ==

"I hadn’t heard of them until now, and it prompted me to do some reading. e-fuels are attempting to synthesize our current fuels in a renewable way, but the process seems (at first glance) like something a large facility would handle. Then we’d receive our fuel the way we always have.

This line of research is about a different kind of fuel, one that is 100% renewable since the reaction doesn’t release any co-products. These “Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers” (LOHCs) consist of chemicals that can absorb and release hydrogen “on demand”. When they absorb hydrogen, heat is generated. When they release it, heat is consumed.

Since the hydrogen gets reused on the spot, the whole thing works like a battery. You can introduce energy into the system and it is stored in the form of a chemical until the counter-reaction is triggered. 

The biggest hurdle seems to be the infrastructure needed to manage the H2, which is notoriously problematic in this elemental form. That is (I believe) where *this* paper comes in: they seem to have found a way to store H2 in liquid form, and a catalyst to use it in the LOHC in this liquid form, bypassing the need for the gaseous form of Hydrogen.

"And if you know about rockets that headline is immediately suspect. How is a rocket engine 3D printed in a single piece? I could see that being true if it’s a solid fuel engine.

"I kind of disagree with you there. Rollout would be quicker if the West was buying panels from China but both the U.S and the E.U have protectionist clauses in the green deals that incentivise local production. The problem being, the supply is not able to keep up with demand and the panels cannot be produced as quickly because we were slow to subsidise the industry.

Ground installation is pretty cheap. It's basic stuff like mounting brackets and wiring. Installation costs are ballooned by permits and application processes though because these can be a bit tedious in the West and there is a lot of politics that slow the processes.

"Panels cost 26 cents per watt to produce in china compared to US 40 cents per watt in the US. It is much cheaper, but to actually install panels it costs about 4 dollars per watt. Like, yeah, those 14 cents would be nice, but it's about 0.3% decrease in costs. There has to be a solution that makes it cheaper to take the panel from the factory to the roof or somewhere else it can be used. Something that not only requires less mounting brackets and less wiring, but something that requires less personnel, as that is majority of the costs. If reducing permits and application process helps, that should be done too.

"We already have 30% rebate for the final cost of the panels. It helps, but those are gonna become smaller soon, and the problem is not the cost to the end user, it's the total cost of the installation of panels themselves. Fuck the money, lets just think of it from industrial capacity problem. Money is just physical representation of a country production capacity. The problem is that it takes too many people, and the supply chains are way too complex and convoluted for the solar panel to move from the factory to the user. They either have to be bigger, or have to be mass manufactured as kits easier to mount, make them safer to install or something. Whatever it is, needs to be investigated and fixed. Maybe solar is just inherently difficult to add, so maybe instead of doing that, make it a requirement that new buildings need to have specific amount of solar panels and batteries installed. Then it would be easier to install during construction.

"In Australia, typically most batteries are 10 year warranty but supply/install costs mean the battery takes 15ish years to pay off. It's very dependent on use as well though.

From what I've seen most warranties are also limited to a given amount of power throughput, eg max 30MWh. So if you're doing a lot of charge/discharge through the day, you won't get to the 10 years. Similar to a car warranty being whatever comes first of 5 years or 500,000km.

"I looked into installing something here in Georgia. I have a roof deck but that means my effective roof is smaller than my actual roof size. In order to install enough panels I need to build a pergola on my roof. 

The system cost @$20k plus whatever the pergola would cost. The pricing was from a solar co-op which was combining costs and splitting it among the customers who built each season. 

But there is no excess electricity buy back in Georgia so my system would need roughly 15-20 years just to break even on the solar but not the pergola.

"> Meaning that China's solar panel production is totally fake news?

nope, not saying its fake news at all, the solar panels you can buy are quite real.  

It means that this guy has published, or had published 2 articles and there is no peer review of these panels he has created yet.  I cannot find any info from peer reviewing of these panel improvements from anywhere.  Therefore, just like the range of their electric cars, and many other things they have been caught blatantly lying about, I will wait until peer review happens and can confirm the improvements.  

>This kind of short-sightedness is among many reasons why America is so behind on solar.

no, we are so behind on solar because companies are charging an asinine amount for install.  I will be putting solar panels on my roof with micro inverters next year.  I can fit about 6300kw worth of panels up there, maybe more if panels improve by next year.  The panels and microinverters, along with all the wiring will cost me less than $3000 USD to buy.  Without a battery bank, I have gotten several quotes from ""solar install companies"" wanting $14000 or more for install.  The reason the US is behind in solar is because capitalism wins and companies are charging insane amount for installing cheap panels, so no one does it.   We also have electric utilities fighting it as hard as they can, in my case, my electric provider paid for a law in our state that allows them to deny net metering or paying out when a customer puts back more into their system than they use, and they also got a law passed that allows them to charge a $30 per month ""solar customer"" fee to people that have solar even if their electricity bill is zero dollars and they put hundreds of kWh back into the system, the power company gets it for free and gets to charge the customer $30 for their trouble.",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3YmpRQ3NDazNIUDJoTUU1LTVsc0NDN094U0VOVU50LVF5Y3lNUFJPdjNTUmtQRXl3Xzl6clFYbXRadmxMcVYyamlnYmdEM1pRV2lkWTRnTzNWcW1POFE9PQ==

"In fact; ChatGPT responded to ‘Give me a sustainable model for solving climate change within 10 years’ with:

‘Addressing climate change comprehensively within a decade requires a multi-faceted approach and global cooperation. Here’s a sustainable model:

Rapid Transition to Renewable Energy: Shift subsidies and investments from fossil fuels to renewable sources like solar, wind, and hydro. Governments should set ambitious targets for renewable energy adoption and incentivize private sector involvement.

Energy Efficiency: Implement strict efficiency standards for buildings, appliances, and transportation to reduce energy demand. Encourage retrofitting of existing infrastructure to improve efficiency.

Carbon Pricing: Implement carbon pricing mechanisms such as carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems to incentivize emissions reductions and fund climate initiatives.

Reforestation and Land Use: Protect and restore forests, wetlands, and other natural carbon sinks. Promote sustainable land management practices to enhance carbon sequestration.

Electrification of Transportation: Accelerate the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) through subsidies, infrastructure development (charging stations), and incentives for consumers and manufacturers.

Circular Economy: Promote recycling, reuse, and waste reduction to minimize resource consumption and greenhouse gas emissions associated with production.

Climate Resilience and Adaptation: Invest in infrastructure and policies that build resilience to climate impacts like extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and food security challenges.

Education and Awareness: Foster public awareness and education on climate change impacts and solutions. Empower communities to take action and support climate-friendly behaviors.

International Cooperation: Strengthen international agreements like the Paris Agreement, ensuring commitments are met and scaled up over time. Collaborate on technology transfer and financial support for developing countries.

Innovation and Research: Increase funding for clean energy research, development of carbon capture technologies, and other innovative solutions to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy.

This model integrates immediate action with long-term strategies, emphasizing the need for systemic changes across all sectors of society and the economy. Success depends on political will, technological innovation, and sustained public engagement at local, national, and global levels.’

"Well, when you ask AI to design the most efficient possible transport at large scale, it eventually makes a train no matter what tools or resources are available.

We have to change our behavior and we refuse. We don't want a solution to climate change, we want some technology that will mitigate the consequences of the daily global human routine *so we can keep doing it*.

Think about it. These people don’t blink an eye at killing thousands, corrupting the future of humanity a whole, just for the profit on their already temporary lives. 

What benefit does their existence provide humanity? Seriously asking. Do you actually have a serious answer? I’d love to know. 

For as long as they continue to be allowed to operate as they are, they only cause the acceleration of the destruction of our entire species. They’re a virus. They are cancer, and they will never learn. Even if they stopped today, that could never undo the damage they’ve done. 

And what do we do with virii, or cancer? Usually? Out of necessity? 🤔

If a robot decided what you stated was necessary, I’d breathe a sigh of relief and probably go back to church, because I’d be inclined to believe there is a God out there who is just and cares about our future.

This would not be a failure of design. It would go a long f*cking way to solving the problem. And that’s not really up for debate.

The real shocker is why humanity somehow hasn’t collectively figured out that we need to lock up these sacks of sadly living sh*t already, or; happily, worse.

"To elaborate, interestingly, OpenAI’s scalability is limited by literal amounts of energy.  So recently, data centers and the infrastructure for energy companies that power them have been hot investments and have literally needed to increase their physical footprint.  

However, more energy is not the only solution.  More computing is another solution.  If more computation (multitudes more) can happen using the same energy, suddenly the approach to scaling outward is not through building out more data centers or more energy systems, but by leveraging more quantum computers to compute more efficiently.  

This is relatively well known market trend for anyone who is invested in current AI technology like NVDA or quantum computing investments like IBM or IONQ.",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4elluRHV2aU45dTZTcksydmdoZXI2bERwMGJ5eWhKR2ZtVHVTbnFLbG1VQlhneDluNnNJZHNudHZ6bWo2aUxrZUd3UW51cldCS2h5djdmV19JbjJBMEE9PQ==

"Hang with me here for a second. In the future (which has already happened) there’s a woman born named Grimes. People think that she’s the savior of Mankind because of her exceptional talent, but it’s later found out through a reinterpretation of the ancient texts that it is, in fact, her SON who is the prophet and not her. 

It is also known that the folks to blame for the current destruction of mankind are the followers of Elon Musk and his first male heir, the indomitable techno-fascist Griffin Musk. The Elders send Grimes back in time to give Elon Musk another male Heir who will compete for what is now understood to be Griffins’ throne. 

This will, as is foretold, create a terrible war fought between evil and good forces, using technology from Tesla and a competing electric car company (Edison) respectively. ultimately a more peaceful time prevails with fully renewable energy.

>How did the chip perform? 

>Using this chipset, the researchers successfully demonstrated high linearity for multi-level modulation. With a modulated signal with 32 QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) and a symbol rate of 40 Gbaud, the researchers achieved a transmission speed of 200 Gbps. The bit error rate was less than 10-3. 

>When using 16 QAM modulation, the researchers successfully achieved speeds of 120 Gbps over a distance of nearly 50 feet (15 m). 

>To test the chip in a multiple-input and multiple-output configuration, the researchers connected it to four transmitter and four receiver modules, where each antenna could handle its own data stream. 

>In 16 QAM modulation, each antenna reached speeds of 160 Gbps, delivering a total transmission speed of 640 Gbps. This is up to 100 times faster than 5G systems currently available in the market.

"Very cool!!!

""The findings of this study emphasize that prominent anomalies in the earthquake precursors in a time interval of about 15 days before the earthquake, first in the lithosphere and then in the upper layers, i.e. in the atmosphere and ionosphere, respectively are observed,"" the study concludes.

Of course, this is still just a hypothesis based on looking back at one quake so far. The researchers will need to analyze data from many more events across different regions to see if LAIC pans out as a reliable precursor system.

If the LAIC theory holds water, we could be looking at a whole new ballgame for earthquake early warning capabilities.

"**From the article:**

Chatbot fails are now a familiar meme. Meta’s [short-lived scientific chatbot Galactica](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/11/18/1063487/meta-large-language-model-ai-only-survived-three-days-gpt-3-science/) made up academic papers and generated wiki articles about the history of bears in space. In February, Air Canada was ordered to honor a refund policy invented by its customer service chatbot. Last year, a lawyer was fined for submitting court documents filled with fake judicial opinions and legal citations made up by ChatGPT. 

This tendency to make things up—known as hallucination—is one of the biggest obstacles holding chatbots back from more widespread adoption.

To understand why large language models hallucinate, we need to look at how they work. The first thing to note is that making stuff up is exactly what these models are designed to do. When you ask a chatbot a question, it draws its response from the large language model that underpins it. But it’s not like looking up information in a database or using a search engine on the web. 

Peel open a large language model and you won’t see ready-made information waiting to be retrieved. Instead, you’ll find billions and billions of numbers. It uses these numbers to calculate its responses from scratch, producing new sequences of words on the fly. A lot of the text that a large language model generates looks as if it could have been copy-pasted from a database or a real web page. But as in most works of fiction, the resemblances are coincidental. A large language model is more like an infinite Magic 8 Ball than an encyclopedia. ",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDX1FQc1l0a3FudXJJdVVtUHJWcDRVVEtia0dkeXF0VDRxN2dkRjF4S05QOGU5Uk9rczhZdzR2aURmN0RocjI4NFQwdTRaZXJHOU1LOFVhVEhsSDVDYmc9PQ==

">When it comes to artificial intelligence, appearances can be deceiving. The mystery surrounding the inner workings of large language models (LLMs)...

""When it comes to artificial intelligence"" a LLM is not one, and never will be one. Quit conflating the terms. 

It's like inventing a wheel and constantly referring to the wheel as an automobile, because it's been speculated that wheels will lead to automobiles. 

An actual AI would use a llm the same as we do. That's what makes it an ai. It's simulating normal cognitive functions, just much faster than our bio hardware. Language is just an amalgam of accepted communication methods. A book can ""learn"" words and phrases the same as a llm. The book just cannot manipulate the words or phrases once they're ""learned"". LLM's are like complex ""pick your own ending"" books, and nothing more. 

AI is such an overused hyped up word. It's becoming meaningless, because it's misused so frequently to describe anything connected to a llm.

"Big fat NO. 

Language does change but scientific technical language doesn’t.  

You can call a dog a cat because everyone in secular society does but for the definition for a vet then it’s still a dog.  

And it’s actually really important when it comes to what’s happening with AI and the research and funding as well. 

At present because AI is really LLM what has happened is an increase in the contributory data sets.  LLM’s haven’t really got better their fidelity is increased because of significantly larger data sets increasing the overall likelihood of an outcome. 

What’s not really being worked on is the AI aspect of making deterministic relational outcomes from the larger scale data.  Ie it knows the sun, a lemon and a sponge cake are yellow but cannot extrapolate that a banana is in the same colour family unless it has more data…

None of that was present in scientific or technical language until recently. It’s all new additions to the language. AI was science fiction before it was technical.

"Yes, language changes, and non logical uses of language pop up. Idioms exist. I understand how language works. What doesn't change is the idea of what constitutes a definition. When the changing of vernacular is not driven by necessity for more definition, then it's driven by the misconception of what the definition is of the words that are being used. Misusing a term over and over doesn't make it right. It doesn't matter how popular misusing a concept becomes. It's still a misguided concept, and now everyone using that term figuratively seems like a total fucking dipshit to anyone with half a brain. 

""AI"" is not a figurative term. Its not an idiom. It's a specific thing. It's not a vague concept, or an undefined whimsical idea to just attach to whatever, because people are gullible morons. 

It's like if I started calling everything a ""computer"". ""I'm going to go drive my computer to work, and then I'm going to use my computer. Then at lunch I'll open my computer and then use my computer a while longer, before driving my computer home to my computer, where I live"" 

Well, all those things have a computer that controls them, so they're all ok to just refer to as ""computers"" because that's not confusing or a stupid use of language, when perfectly good words already exist to describe the thing I'm using...like a car, or a LLM, or a computer. 

Calling a hippopotamus a whale is not accurate, even if they did eventually evolve into whales. They're not the same thing, and conflating them just makes you look ignorant.

"Thank you for your comment. I co-run an adaptive rock climbing group so I sometimes forget that I’m around people with disabilities more often than most. As a result, I’ve learned a lot about prostheses. My friend who I was chatting with last night was describing phantom limb pain last night and that he could also still “feel” his toes, even though his leg was amputated a few months ago due to cancer.

I’m also disabled by a different condition, but recently found improvement with a new medication. I feel like it’s giving me back some quality of life around athletics and if a new foot or leg can do that for an amputee, that would be amazing.",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZLUYyM3FBbU1qNU5PMHY0UFVDRzNGdW9iaHdBcFBSZVpYTTBOVS13WXRWbUhKNFVQVWVSdzIzWnVXQjA5eHlkTUoxc3M1cWxGNEtmbm9fa21zN3hKdmhkRVBwR1hlTkRDb052SE90MXU3cTA9

"I 110% *guarantee* that this is overhyped bullshit that someone who’s never set foot on an actual construction site has devised. Is it also capable of cutting out/accounting for things like exterior plugs/lights/and other assorted objects that require accommodations through the walls that it’s constructing? Or is it *literally* just capable of feeding bricks into position to form a basic walled “structure”? I’m also going to guess that it probably requires the entire area that it’s working in to be clear of other personnel as well, unlike with traditional masonry/bricklaying where you can have other work, by other trades, being done in concurrence in the immediate vicinity. 

Lots of carefully curated exclusions that are immediate tells of overhyped/oversold tech bullshit akin to how half a dozen companies tried touting “self-driving” functionality in cars initially….

"I noticed multiple ventures testing adhesive alternatives to meet building code between 2016 and 2020. I cannot say if people have been using this method or researching it before then. With regard to masonry, adhesive really only works if the block manufacturers also ground each block smooth on the top and bottom. That is asking a masonry unit manufacturer to retool or add more time/effort per block. Changing the unit type has slowed the adoption of adhesive in masonry.

"Had to circle back to this, so got a pair and finally ran in them (thankfully only paid $135 for a new pair on eBay).  They are nothing like the Alphafly comfort-wise.  If I could compare them to anything else Nike, it’d be the Pegasus 3 trail without the comfort.  The Ultrafly felt way too stiff and I ultimately developed a burn spot on my left foot after about 7 miles (did 11.5 in total).  I want to point out that I was on a super easy trail with some road mixed in (I typically run this trail in road shoes, that’s how flat it is) and the stiffness of these was just overwhelming.  I would have hated to break them in on a semi-technical trail, I might have face planted with one wrong step.  I did, however, like the roominess of the toe box and their light weight.  My hope is they soften up over time.  I wouldn’t use them in an ultra, I just don’t think they’d provide long distance comfort but would most certainly use them in a 10k to half marathon trail race if they soften.

"P1 Hi all,

I have been following FBR for 8+ years invested for about 7 and continued to accumulate. The most common questions turning people away on initial thought seem to be where the mortar is and why is there small gaps in the bricks. Here is the thing HX doesn't yet do face brick so best accept and move away from those thoughts. It uses an adhesive accepted to building requirements in many parts of the world.

FBR is not after building every house. To be a behemoth with a lot of success they don't need build every house neither does any other company. Look around different countries and suburbs and you will see face brick isn't the only option. Many houses have render or external cladding finish suitable for HX. In one home structure, HX completed the majority of walls with masons completing a small face brick wall showing how people and machines can work together if chosen.

Using the prototype HX 109 which came out in about 2020 they have completed walls for approximately 30 structures in Perth WA. These structures include homes, double-story townhouses, childcare centres, and smaller office/shopping centre. The focus for 109 was to complete all different types of structures under different conditions for example tilted slab. Most structures have been done with Perth prominent well-known builders of the area. 109 was an infield testing ground of what can happen. Those structures can be seen by watching many of the FBR videos. They have all met building codes and structural engineering requirements.

109 has demonstrated to the world that has been watching how DST (the primary technology of interest) works. This is pioneering technology in this space for outdoor robotics and is worth reading up about. Using DST FBR has built-in rain, 25 knot winds, hail, etc. the machine just keeps going. It has built walls for a home without a single brick waste using its proprietary software whereas most homes will waste around 10% in brick waste.

Competition in this market exists with the most prominent being ICON 3D concrete printing and Construction Robotics SAM & MULE. Neither of these comes close in product delivery. ICON gantry system takes about 16 days to build the walls and leaves a layered toothpaste structure which has its issues like dust buildup on lumpy walls etc, they are worth approximately 2 billion USD in comparison to FBR at 220 million AUD. ICON's gantry system needs to be set up and then removed in comparison to FBR's HX which is a fully mobile machine designed for local roads. HX drives to the site and is ready in approximately 15 minutes. HX has millimetre accuracy allowing roof lintels to be prefabricated, other areas can be predesigned. The only negative for HX is it costs about $500 more to get the slab to be accurate.",r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRjRhMmV3VWpvcVBhaXNUWXFIczAtMUk4VzRDdlVEX0FnbUh5ZVZCeTRVcTJNcFZjYkNnNkp4S1FwZEFUbWJaZDZYTUltZm1PM2RjaDViZ1pEM0FLU1E9PQ==
"P2. Like ICON's products, SAM & MULE are both good inventions, but they are not in the same ballpark, I won't write about that here go and have a look. Since 2020 FBR has been working on its first commercial model HX 110 improvements have been made in speed, reliability, waste, and component design for mass manufacturing. Some of Liebherr's engineers have been assisting with design. The current JV if processed and significant machine orders look to have Liebherr mass manufacture machines. All information is available for you to read, and look at announcements.  
  
FBR is currently setting up a maintenance workshop for the first HX 110 in Liebherr facilities in Florida while they undergo the pilot program with CRH. The 110 wasn't given to the Australian market in the first instance as the global opportunity with Liebherr and CRH presented better. FBR are about to undergo SAT (Sits acceptance testing in Florida) and 10 structure programs with CRH before signing a JV which will give them a rolling loan of 40 million for HX production with up to 300 machines to be provided. FBR has already built more structures than the pilot program and met key milestones such as speed. CRH is a company worth 50 billion. Unlike opportunities in Australia first JV is with a behemoth in Florida to FastTrack revenue and growth.  
  
110 is currently laying at 330 blocks an hour approximately at the size of 6 standard bricks meaning walls of a 4x2 home of double brick can be built in a single day. 110 can deliver much larger bricks and that time can significantly reduce to less than half a day if bricks of that size become available. Remembering the best competitor with a far less superior end product is 16 days.  
  
110 has recently landed in US and gone through customs. It is on its way or has arrived at Liebherr facility about to begin the CRH JV program. The world has not yet seen a machine that can build the walls of a house in a day, when they do what will happen to the share price? Time will tell.  
  
I have friends who have seen the HX in real life and feedback has been great, following trades with comments on the accuracy making following work much easier.  
  
I could go on for days. But I strongly suggest people who are looking to invest do their research not on initial face value but look at the details, look at the partnerships, look at the achievements, look at the industry (currently average bricklayer is 50, and young ones don't want to do it).  
  
I am not tied to FBR and can pull my money at any point. I do however see this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to significantly change the building industry with no real competition currently present. A strong patent security by FBR.

"That is exactly what they have done in Western Australia. You should look it up.

Following trades were giving great feedback saying follow-up work is easier due to accuracy. The only negative is slab requires a tiny bit more attention in finance terms they are paying $500 more for the slab.

The truck gets to the site, outriggers are set up then about 15 minutes to setup lasers. It is really quick then starts laying bricks.

Some other info they can design builds from any normal architectural drawing, that gets placed into their software and design the house by counting every brick and position.

"It can lay either. Any block/brick up to 2 feet long and from memory 45kg. Bigger than what currently available, larger blocks if made will mean faster build times.
