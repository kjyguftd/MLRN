"Absolute copium.

We KNOW the human mind doesn’t work on the same algorithms. What tf do you think neuroscience and psychology have been up to for the past 200+ years?

I literally gave you a way to tell. Test the AI’s memory for more than 5 minutes and stress test the limits of what it can tell you. I’ve DONE THAT with every ai I’ve ever used. And all of them have very clear limits and no ability to store ANY memory at all. You can also tell it repeatedly NOT to do something and it will do it regardless in the next line. And ALL AIs do this. Because it’s just a language prediction model with mass data sets to copy and slightly rearrange into gramattically correct sentences. Which it doesn’t even do correctly like 1/4 of the time.

Here’s another simple test: Describe a human being to any AI without having ever exposed it to a data set including images of humans. And then tell it to draw a human being. It physically can’t. Because it has no conscious understanding of what it’s being told to draw. So all its pattern recognition is usless and can’t produce any image, let alone something human-like.

This is already an issue with image-generating AI. All it can do is copy parts of other images in its data set. It can’t create anything entirely new. And if it can’t copy from a data set, it can’t create anything at all. No matter how well you explain it.

Blind people for example can draw and sculpt. Because they have a conscious understanding of the shape that something has even if they can’t see it. Even if their drawings and sculptures look a little off, they’re still gonna be fairly accurate. An AI can’t do that. Because it has no conscious understanding of anything in it.

Without these impossibly large data sets to “train” the pattern recognition software, AI is utterly useless. It isn’t “learning” anything. It’s jusy copying as exactly as possible what the data sets are showing.

Also you’re seriously out here arguing that mass-sorting algorithms are the same as conscious thought. By that logic, all computers are ALREADY sentient. Because the algorithms these AI use aren’t anything particularly new. They’re just being applied to much larger data sets than before.

You can talk about your “matrix” fanfiction somewhere else.",r/technews,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZWEM2UjNIU2oxd2ZwSGVDUDg0R2pXNTYyUXJWMmFlcURfS3FvaVFsNHIzRHBMYTVtVGJqVjJLSlBCWWg4c0ZlMU5VLUdaYWI0QkRZRm9nTFNsTUhRTkE9PQ==

I'm being very very general and I know everyone has a different experience, but for the most part, everyone is baselined as a baby.

"It absolutely does.  Hydrogen production today is from natural gas or other fossil fuels.  The article even states as much.  It does go on to state that hopefully, in the future, we might be able to generate hydrogen (and oxygen) by electrolyzing water with renewable electricity but that's nowhere near currently feasible.   Desalination will become another critical codeveloent/competition to electrolytic clean hydrogen production as fresh water becomes more scare as well.


The ability to generate green hydrogen needs to come a lot further.

"This is such a bad take lol…

I’m currently creative director at my start up tech company, fairly small 8 ppl atm. Very broad role and I wear a lot of different hats.

I use ChatGPT to generate short bits of code which often just lets me copy and paste it. Big time saver when it’s useful, but it’s not useful that often.

I also use it if I’m making a pitch deck and I want someone to brain storm with who’s knowledge on a certain subject, recently I made a deck for a holiday resort in an East Asian country I hadn’t been to before, for example. This is a fairly frequent use case.

The biggest though is art. Creating mock ups takes time and is really expensive. I also make loads of client decks. You can quite easily get art that doesn’t look like AI very quickly from AI models (I like Bing and midjourney), which is a lot more economic as something like only 1 in 5 decks actually turn into a deal. 4/5 times the art is just binned, and we need a lot of art!

"It depends on how far down the privacy hole you want to go. There's no truly satisfying answer.

For basic storage needs, any paid service with zero-knowledge encryption (meaning they have no access to your data because you are the owner of the encryption keys) and where you are the customer and not the product should do fine.  Examples are iDrive Internxt, Proton Drive etc.

For more secure storage where nobody else has access the only way to guarantee protection is to host the data storage yourself. Of course, this is more complex than most people are willing or able to attempt. And self-hosting anything on the Internet is fraught with potential issues as there's a lot more hackers out there that know what they are doing than you most likely know how to defend against.  Properly protecting a server on the Internet is not easy, and even if you know the basics it still requires constant vigilance.  However if you want to give it a try, then apps like NextCloud can help you replace a lot of the shared services that privacy averse companies like  Google and Microsoft provide, including basic online storage.",r/technews,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaWnlkaHB2YUpPZnQxNThKYkxKdjZDNndVaFVXaDlzbTNQaHRvX09DdXRmeUd6bEpuWC1lQ3VWM2xFenN1TU5XZkNDMEVKaTZNdDE0VWU4aVk3VFU0d1E9PQ==

"“Security is tightened appropriately”
Haha! U almost had me. While  white hats are good, companies very rarely fix the issues thoroughly which is why we continue to watch our data being leaked, repeatedly. It’s cheaper to pay for PR after a hack than purchase and maintain the security infrastructure, daily. 
Furthermore, If the data was stolen and placed on another server not owned by AT&T, then AT&T has no Authority to break into said server to delete it unless the owner of that server has given them explicit permission to do so. “Hacking back” isn’t exactly legal. used to work IR, we absolutely were not allowed to hack back once we discovered who it may have been lol I believe the only “hackers” who have legal authority to hack back are funded by nation states, aka the govt.",r/technews,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhc2ZjUm0zNjhrUU1ienZLV3FwcENjNmZvOUtVTUkwZ0N2V1NuYlpMOEtTcXV4d2hXTDV1QkZkWlEwWGhLRFhlbjNMcWQ5WW9yU2x4Ym5lV1l1TFAyYmc9PQ==

"With an American and a Russian in front of the drone - who does it shoot? They both could be Russian, it’s Russian territory. 

Is one of them really American? They do wear the correct uniform afterall. 

What if a bunch of soldiers in American uniforms comes running aggressively in the direction of the drone? Are they definitely American, or a sneaky attack by Russians on the US camp? Does the drone work out numbers of soldiers at camp, reconcile that to this additional number, then realise these are Russian? What if one of the soldiers has sneaked out to see his squeeze and left his NFC ID at camp - that reconciliation now has created a false negative. 

Do you really want photos of dead people in American uniforms whilst the barrels of a drone are still smoking? It’s not great publicity if these are Russians, and it certainly isn’t good publicity if they are Americans.

"This right here. The term ""honor among thieves"" means something. I used to be involved in some shady shit when I was younger, and it would've benefited most people not to trust me. I always followed the rules and was loyal to my crew despite being kinda a piece of shit in general. I never dabbled in extortion, but if I had, I would've followed the rules still. I was doing what I was doing long term. A one time thing wouldn't do it for me unless we were talking 8 figures or more. I've blew 7 figures during that time, so with the lifestyle I was living, I needed the money to keep coming. I'm not gonna fuck that up being greedy and stupid. 

All you have in a world of illegal business is your balls and your word just like Tony said. Break those and you will no longer be successful. People will stop doing business with you, the law will be on your ass more, and your own people will deal with you if you make their lives harder.

"Clickbait indeed.

These ""AI"" have no ideas of their own. Even the most advanced requires a human to give it a goal, explain how to accomplish the goal, and a list of priorities of which of those steps should be done in which order.

Basically: there is still a human at every step along the way. And that's before we get into weapon arming steps and safeguards, target selection, etc.
