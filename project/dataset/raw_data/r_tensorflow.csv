Tensorflow is big... Like it's... Really damn big. If tensorflow was it's own managed company like spark to databricks, it prolly will be a 50b+ company (and a lot less buggy).

Do you want to...

1. Learn how to create a model and train it with ttensorflow?

2. Learn how to optimize existing models?

3. Learn how to setup infrastructure with tensorflow?

4. Learn how to deploy a model and have it in a production environment?

5. Learn the deep inside knowledge and fix tensorflow issues?

"Does your model convert to tflite? Have you tried running inference and checking the results. You will input the series up until a point and it will predict the following values. 

If you want to continually predict the next value, the naive solution is to run the entire series as input on each inference. The LSTM stores “memory” as it processes through the input series. It does not store memory between inferences. You as a developer, do not need to manage these.

">Would using TensorFlow lite result in decreased accuracy?

Not necessarily. It *can* result in decreased accuracy if you compress the model (which is kind of the point of using TensorFlow Lite), but you don't need to do this if you can get away with not doing it. Of course, you also have control of the optimization process, and you can tune the process to minimize accuracy loss, etc. [Here's a link to their docs with pertinent information](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/model_optimization).

>My question is, what would be the best way to implement this? Our apps have an offline mode. Some of our techs have older phones, but some have newer phones. Some of the wells and lift stations are in areas with weak service.

Asking if this is the ""best' way to implement this is pretty open-ended. It's certainly a good option to evaluate given the context, but there are other options available depending on your overall requirements, constraints, etc. I'd say it'd certainly be preferable to be able to use full TensorFlow since it's more flexible, provides better compatibility, etc. But TensorFlow Lite should definitely be investigated next if you find TensorFlow is too heavy.",r/tensorflow,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2NUVVZGR4Uk9XN29oeDNxQmdzZ015ajlkbE5QaU5QcTd5WkE3YnlQWE1lNGFqQ0xBeldzbHN4ZVNZbVhqR1h1NTlrUFVKNU9oU2stNU1seGNENHRXdFE9PQ==

Additionally, there is no mechanism to prevent the counter from incrementing while holding the ""up"" position. Let's address this by using `useRef` to manage the `canCount` state more effectively.

Here's an improved version of your code:

1. Use a `useRef` to manage the `canCount` state.
2. Ensure the counter only increments once per complete curl.

### Key Changes:
1. **Ref for `canCount`**: By using `useRef` for `canCount`, we avoid the asynchronous state update issues, ensuring `canCount` is correctly managed between frames.
2. **Check for `canCount`**: Only increment the counter if `canCount` is true, and set it to false immediately after incrementing to prevent further increments until the next complete curl.

Make sure to initialize the webcam and pose detection properly in the `useEffect` hook. This code assumes you have a pose detection setup that calls `countReps` with the detected pose. If you need help with setting up the webcam and pose detection, please provide more details about your current setup.",r/tensorflow,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3UkpxZERReGIwVHdQa21NTmNXcDFPX3JLckc4akQ2R1VfMFRLMk50VnFFdnJNU2xidkF0Sl9qdUx4Y0dVd1g4X3VTa0NuYkpyR1l3UjJHUmtEbVh2Umc9PQ==

The above link is the general gist of the code, I’ve tried running it with more epochs at a lower learning rate, adding and removing convolutional layers, etc.

I don’t think the code is too inefficient, but to be fair I did have to upload a 25000 image dataset, and ran the model at 300+ epochs multiple times.",r/tensorflow,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3SGNURFp1Yk1lRTZDZ1p2TWZXajQ4N1JMQVhBMG9WcjR0WWxpMzA2VHhGZXhoa2o4aW51ZVo1MGNRaVJIRTJlRklnRHZGd3NrdmJFdTFBYzRBRnR6Rmc9PQ==
