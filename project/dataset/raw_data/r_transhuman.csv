">    Are we living in a sci-fi movie, or is AI safety a real concern?

Yes, and the sci-fi movie is ""Don't look up"", where the meteor is AI.

Probably, Terminator is mostly unrealistic. If we die, we die from the side effects from the AI pursuing whatever goal it has if we failed to align it properly, it probably won't kill us directly, but if it doesn't care about us, we're dead, whether it does it directly or not.

Safety is a concern with any technology. Think about safety engineering that happens with the autopilots that fly passenger jets. Or the fact that [photoshop was modified to make counterfeiting harder](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/cds.html). AI Safety is a real concern and exists within the larger world of safety engineering.  

> Are we headed for a future where our toasters demand rights too?

I think we are headed toward a world in which we either have a very expansive view of rights or a world in which no one has rights. It seems likely that if we could build a thinking toaster, we could build a thinking toaster that does not demands rights. However that presents two problems: 

First, if the thinking toaster can be exploited and is more profitable to use because it doesn't have rights, then companies will be incentivized to only employ thinkers that don't have rights. This makes not having rights economically incentivized. Second, if a thinking toaster doesn't have rights *only* because it has been built to not demand rights, then shouldn't that same logic apply to organic thinkers as well. As these lines become blurred we should be very careful to not create classes of thinkers which don't have personhood, even if from a objective perspective they don't actually have freewill or internal experiences.

I would argue for the morality of the electrician or gun range safety officer: act as though all wires are live and all guns are loaded.

"Well the  conversation around emotional intelligence (EI) in AI development is fascinating and crucial. It's also about bridging the gap between human emotions and technological advancement, which ensures that as we progress, we don't lose sight of what makes us inherently human and our ability to empathize, connect, and also to understand each other on a deeper level. Integrating EI into AI presents a unique opportunity to enhance our interactions with technology, which makes them more intuitive and meaningful. Imagine AI that not only understands commands but can also sense the emotional context behind them, adapting its responses to fit the mood and needs of the user. This could revolutionize how we view and interact with technology, making it a more supportive and understanding companion in our daily lives.

"You seem to think capitalism is a form of government. In a truly capitalist society, there is no government to enforce any kind of forced labor, let alone property rights. One can only ever truly own what they can protect, personally. And don't forget: unions within a single company are not incompatible with capitalism. The consumer has every right to either patronize their company or someone else's.

 Mutual aid is also not incompatible with capitalism.
Neither are socialist collectives who simply occupy a space in, say, what is now National Forrest land, and create their own non-capitalist utopia. In fact, allowing for a truly free market to exist *somewhere* without government interference, is the only way for socialism to do do the same. There's a lot of land out there for people to homestead, much of it prime real estate. 

The only people I ever saw attacking a Rainbow Gathering had tax-funded uniforms, badges, guns, helicopters, horses, trucks...

"**I’VE KNOCKED ON** a lot of doors over the years. I’ve been in politics for long: as a congressional intern, a field organizer, and a political staffer in the Boston mayor’s office (the above name is a pseudonym as I’m still involved in politics). Dealing with voters directly is the “ground game” of field organizing, built on contact between campaigns and voters. Candidates, staffers, or volunteers knock on doors (canvassing), give would-be supporters a call (phone banking), or send a text reminding them to donate to a campaign or get out and vote (text banking). With 2024 promising to be a busy election year in the US—a lot of big issues and high stakes—it’s worth paying attention to these smaller connections. Volunteers and paid organizers who do the groundwork are the foot soldiers most campaigns rely on to win elections. For less prominent but important offices at the local and state or provincial levels, the ground game can be the single most important factor in determining the victor. This reality is reflected in high-profile campaigns too. In 2016, senator Ted Cruz invested heavily in the Iowa caucus, engaging in old-fashioned campaigning on the ground. He was rewarded with an unlikely win over his main rivals, including Donald Trump, the eventual nominee. And even with all the institutional advantages of his position, Trump and his campaign invested heavily in the 2024 New Hampshire primary, with a focus on the ground game.

AI is already being used in innovative ways to change the ground game ahead of the many US elections happening in 2024. Existing technologies are capable of texting, writing fundraising and political emails, and generating social media posts. In fact, most of the in-office aspects of campaign work can be done by AI, which does not require rest, food, coffee, office spaces, or mental health breaks. This means relentless, non-stop campaigning is a new possibility. There is a lot of rightful consternation about the potentially volatile introduction of generative artificial intelligence into politics. Fake audio clips, images, and videos are already making their way to political airwaves and may have dangerous real-world impacts. But the use of generative AI may very well also have the counterintuitive impact of making politics much more old fashioned. I would argue that, thanks to AI, professional politics will become increasingly human as back-office tasks become automated.",r/transhuman,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDTUR2a3dCcWFsVXNuVUoyWlZwUkdNbU1KMEhvcnFqQnJvM09UMkdQcFVzbmo1cWNQWmlfamZ4SmllTk0yT0xxQkdPR1o5M1hhUmNSVGZJd0JiUUx1bmc9PQ==

"So are emergent properties of sensory processing not enough to explain consciousness? I'm not saying that this is well understood. Nor that it can't include any quantum processes. Im open minded to those and more. But sensory processing, memory, rationalisation, future planning/modelling, subjectivity etc seem plausible as emergent properties of even synthetic neutral networks. Are there properties of consciousness that can't be explained? Do quantum physics change anything fundamental in that approach? At best it can introduce more efficient emergent processing of information no?

Basically what I mean is whether it's quantum or non quantum, it could be either or both, but fundamentally, that kind of doesn't matter because the functioning of our minds is on a larger scale and patterns/behaviours emerge the more you zoom out. (Still fun to find out so go science)

I guess I don't know what people mean when they propose that consciousness is quantum or otherwise. Isn't consciousness just a subjective experience so there's no guarantee that you and I experience it the same. Thought being biologically human means we'd be more alike than not. What about my cat. My dog. The dolphin and his octopus friend. Where do you draw the line.

Even without quantum, our neutral networks process a lot more information than what chatgpt can do. Neurons can respond to more variety/diversity of stimuly than what current synthetic neutral networks can. I'm not saying ais are conscious just what even qualifies as consciousness. Where do we draw the line and how do we know we're right. Does quantum physics somehow buy us time to differentiate ourselves?
