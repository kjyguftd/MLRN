"So the suggestion, should anyone need a TL;DW, is to shamelessly and relentlessly bombard every online space you have access to with simple but effective propaganda, every day.  If you get banned or muted, just make a new account and proceed the next day. 

This isn’t a new idea— for years I’ve seen leftists claiming that “If we just act like the Tea Party/Qanon,  then we’ll be as successful at capturing the Democratic Party as the Tea Party/Qanon has been in capturing the Republican Party.” That’s not going to work. There is an asymmetry in the audiences you are trying to attract. 

[Conservatives tend to focus on the negative, they have a stronger physiological response to threats, they fear new experiences and are psychologically reactive to fear.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-in-the-machine/201612/fear-and-anxiety-drive-conservatives-political-attitudes?amp) And it is all too easy to make up a bunch of bullshit that plays on those psychological tendencies and manipulates those base emotions. 

Liberals on the other hand are simply not motivated by fear and anxiety in the same way, and you can’t use to same tactics to rile them so much that have them eating out of the palm of your hand. All you have to do is consider the partisan divide on things like *critical thinking, facts & evidence, and logic & reason.* 

I agree completely about the importance of organization and making a concerted effort that amounts to more than yakking about your politics inside your own echo chambers, as well as the need for simple, easy to digest messages that can be clearly communicated… but it’s going to take more than inventing some compelling propaganda and blasting it all over the internet.",r/trollfare,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSUGlxQWp3M0RTS1p5RWdheDJRS2g1R0owaG0yMEQ0eFlud2RDRHF3eE1xcm4yRU0zZkpwUHBlM0kzYm9kc2luSHdKY1FadFhucnJXblBtMFFCV21XUUlTVHY0WlZyWlFIWjNsOVZpaEUtQTg9

"To find a lot of what look to me like Russian-controlled propaganda accounts, just search Twitter used the Russian romanization of town names.  So, Kharkov, Odessa, etc. 

To me, it seems as if you find more propaganda accounts when you leave off the hash sign (#).

I think at least 10 percent of the Twitter results for Kharkov, sorted by poising time, seem as if they were posted by people who are part of an organized pro-Russian campaign. 

I guess, one question is, how do you distinguish a sincere pro-Russian from a member of a propaganda team.

"I don't know about China, but one thing is certain, the pro zionist army is all over Reddit.

Especially in r/worldnews, where it's pretty clear when they start their day to the point it's becoming an inside joke. For instance [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/17vzf5z/comment/k9ekfdn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) people are speculating about paid trolls.

It's amazing how quickly fake news are relayed in Reddit and the US media without verification when it comes to this conflict, and how corrections/retractions are buried or downright shadowbanned.

Two examples of that are:

1. the [fake story of the beheaded babies](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2023/10/13/watching-the-watchdogs-babies-and-truth-die-together-in-israel-palestine) that was forcefully propagated on the major social medias, and its retraction almost completely silent. The fact that the White House admitted not having first hand account of it was silenced too.
2. the [fake story of the failed palestinian rocket](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/24/world/middleeast/gaza-hospital-israel-hamas-video.html) after the Gaza hospital was bombed. That story was pushed by the IDF and relayed by the US, and prominently featured in the US media and social medias for days. Dozens of articles relaying this theory were posted on the subreddit. Eventually, after a week the NYT and several researchers identified that the rocket originated from Israel but that story was completely buried in r/worldnews, intentionally.

While several of these rebuttals were posted on r/worldnews, none could see the light of day in a subreddit with 33.7M users and tens of thousands online at any time. The censorship is strong.

It is also remarkable how unproven theories are relayed as facts, like the convenient theory of the Hamas terrorists that hide in the population.

First off, it cannot be an excuse for indiscriminate killings of civilians, like it is by the israeli government, and drunk wholesale by the White House. Secondly, there is exactly zero proof of this. It is most likely that most Gaza fighters live among their own families and/or simply defend their families. These people are indiscriminately labeled ""Hamas terrorists"" even if they don't belong to the Hamas, as this gives the IDF an excuse to expedite the ethnic cleansing of Gaza. In any case, the Israeli government doesn't give any proof of their allegations and thus should'nt be trusted wholesale. But the fine folks in the western medias are very happy to relay the theory of the human shielding without verification.",r/trollfare,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSN01HNXUxc0dPQzd6TmpDOVNfX1haR09mNk10OXFURG9FcnB5azR5MDNsakt5bXhEckM4aWZBVWg2b0diaFA4djdlTmlBWTh6dy1IcEdKUjY0dVc5LUE9PQ==

There Moscow (and Tehran) has successfully reversed genocidaire and victim in the minds of many people who really should know better.

Oooh no, couldn't do that, that kind of *overtly political behavior* might upset some kind of hypothetical undecided moderate swing-state voter ...",r/trollfare,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSWVVlYlFpc0F1RkxXTmxpVFpWWi1tcHZMTUVrcGJkLWYzeTlmUy15cGNuUkVzWTk4b1Nubnk1a2pRTUZTRmYyR0JONjlMLUo1Z0pVOEJ6emtoQkNELUE9PQ==
"To quote another redditor (https://old.reddit.com/r/trollfare/comments/17w9cq4/the_urgent_call_for_a_bipartisan_disinformation/k9g4479/):

Because Republicans *are* disinformation. They are nothing else. Disinformation has utterly eaten their party and left nothing behind. If we get rid of disinformation, especially Russian disinformation, Republicans will go away, and they know it

So basically, they have to defend our worst enemies (Russian, Iranian, and Chinese propagandists) by extending 1st Amendment protections to them, in order to survive themselves",r/trollfare,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSNVM3MUlTelFQWnhiUjFtMDRIS3lTUjQ0dXFJUGVEQXJ1MXZWWXFaMjJVR0JLUzBNV3RpbXZHaGt1RVNlbTJyNFg1VTFhWDRaNDFIWHJ4aFhSNHVUWmc9PQ==

> ""2,400 years ago, the Greek philosopher Aristotle argued that logos (reasoned argumentation) is only one element of political rhetoric, matched in importance by ethos (trustworthiness) and pathos (emotional resonance).
