"Yes and no, I understand what you are saying from a ""Grand Scheme"" standpoint, but the ideal situation is having full air superiority, no missiles are able to reach military or civilian targets by Russia.

Soldiers fight better knowing they're family is safe and secure, compared to depressed/enraged about loss or fearful of the next text message from home after an air raid.

Better air defence from allies much earlier on would have this problem nearly tied up already, but deployment of F-16s can help achieve this ideal situation sooner.",r/ukraine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZc3oza3R5Yl9aWFV0N2xiQzgxNFcyTHBjdHZ4M0hoTk9meHN4TE1NRFgyeFZMNDNEQlRBXzNlOEc1YXFkX195d3kwZ2J5WlZoSVAyQzFvaEtpcl9FMzdENGFjSl9MNHRRYUd6OVd1aS1jVWs9

"Competent ones would.

You're imagining a world in which a perfect outcome is possible, but that's not the world we live in.

Military commanders have to choose the least shit outcome. Every day, they give orders which will *inevitably* result in some deaths, and they do this so that in the long run they can end the war.

And if they had to choose, they would choose to retain critical infrastructure without which *they cannot win the war*, over lives which will not affect the outcome of that war. It's a *shit* decision to have to make, but if you don't make it, then *all* of those people will die in the end anyway when the country can no longer fight.

"Bro, not to rain on your parade, but this S-grade copium has been going around since the beginning of the war.

By every metric the ""forever war"" scenario is by leaps and bounds not favorable to Ukraine. Ukraine has 100 mil less people, its economy is basically on life support at this point while being constantly attacked by Ruzzia, it's already showing signs of manpower issues, the western aid has been and still is being provided in ""barely-enough"" amounts, and lastly, the most stupid of all, Ruzzia's MIC and even military installations are being safeguarded by the western restrictions. This is not even an uphill battle anymore. 

>They aren't desperately throwing men at local towns constantly because they think they can afford to wait

This kind of talk about Ruzzia running out of meat any day now because of the ""unsustainable losses"" has been going on since the Bakhmut campaign. And yet they've been continuously losing close to 1k personnel daily for more than a year now. It's the only working strategy they've managed to come up with. 

>A protracted war sees Ukraine getting increasing support

So far it's only been more pledges and promises following a yet another heinous war crime by Ruzzia. And we're not even talking about offensive materiel. 

Bottom line - this war might be the end of Ruzzia, but it has a lot more fat to burn than Ukraine, and the western aid is highly contingent on the political scene and the war-fatigue in the west. Simply saying ""nah, just wait and Ruzzia will topple down"" is a plan for failure.",r/ukraine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZNHN6U191dkZwWmlmTTdITWlGdDhnR0VBbUhpU093RldjVGcxdW1YTEJTRWNnRjZtMDhTdTZXdzJIaGhEYmhRV2x4Z0hicFRrZ2JkYUtZaTRQc094cFE9PQ==

"> AIM-120D, 160-180km range : any Russian plane coming within 100km of the border is in serious danger from these. And any Russian aircraft not within 100km of the border isn't going to be any use whatsoever in stopping a Ukrainian ground assault, which achieves the suppression goal without firing a shot.

Sure, but you're looking at the missile alone.

Let's look at the radar of F-16 Block 15 MLU that Ukraine'll get.

In our case, it's AN/APG-66(V)2.

Let's assume they ***were not*** deliberately worsened, [as was the case with counterbattery radars](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-stinger-deliveries-to-ukraine-followed-long-search-for-technical-fix-11646773886)

This still gives us... a whopping ***150km*** detection range in perfect conditions. 83km assuming some jamming.

Now, R-77M has a range of 193km, while R-37M is pushing it to almost 400km.

NATO AWACS? Tough luck, as it's apparently too escalatory and ""basically the same thing as shooting down russian plane ourselves.""

It'll still check out for ""alongside F-16"" - later ones, but still.

So unless you somehow get TRML-4D *closer* to enemy than F-16 that launches the missile, it's not gonna work terribly well.

The F-16 is great! It will really help Ukraine for sure and I hope it helps destroy Russia.

The U.S will be retiring the a-10s why can’t we give those to Ukraine too? As an American I say we even go further than that.

"> this S-grade copium has been going around since the beginning of the war.

Yes since the start of the war some analysts had predicted in 2-5 years Russia will have burned through their reserves of Soviet equipment and that their economy eventually overheats meaning they won't be able to sustain the war at anywhere near the current intensity. Those predictions look to be about right, in a couple years the Russians are in real trouble to sustain the war effort at anything near the present level.

The sanctions mean they are burning through their cash reserves as the trading partners they have left bend Russia over the barrel from both ends, once when they buy their oil and other resources at bargain basement prices and then again when they sell them sanctioned goods. Those trading partners don't want to paid for those goods in useles rubles, they want foreign currency, which Russia is running out of because they are making very little off what they export. That is not sustainable long term. And once they can't pay for those dual use goods they won't be able to produce new military equipment at the rate they are now, especially higher end stuff like tanks, airplanes, cruise missiles and so on.

People complain the sanctions aren't working, the whole point is that you could never stop it all but you can grind them down over time, which they are.

And multiple analysts looking at satellite imagery have confirmed Russia is running out of tanks, artillery pieces and armored vehicles in storage, within a couple years at most it will be pretty much gone.

Sure Russia has a lot of men they *could* conscript but even though Russia's best chance to win the war was in the 6 month period when US aid was suspended Putin was still reluctant to have an additional wave of mobilization to get more men to the front. Russia having a bigger population doesn't matter as much when Putin is too afraid to draft men.

And yes Ukraines success does depend on its allies continuing to supply it but that has been true since the start of the war, if you think the west is suffering from war fatigue what do you think the average Russian is feeling right now? 

So in 2 to 3 years Russia has a failing economy and no Soviet era stocks to fall back on to provide heavy weaponry for their troops. Even if Putin decides to forcibly mobilize more more men at that point if they have little to fight with other than an AK and some body armor the war is not going to go in their favor. It's not ""S-grade copium"" to look at the current situation and see that the long term outlook doesn't seem to favor Russia.",r/ukraine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZX0h4cURPSjU1NGNiZ3Q5QTd5SDQ0cHJrOGtsUlVid2FqSVA5QjhSbFRlZ0dka2FJMC1acDBqTGxENTd3SndOSGFYdUpiOUFZOGMwNGFwMC1UWHFLV2c9PQ==

Park Live Almaty is a festival sponsored by Russian business Yandex. It will be held in Almaty, Kazakhstan, on September 6-8.

Among the participants of the festival are Placebo, Die Antwoord, Oliver Tree, Tyga, Brennan Savage, and Dizzee Rascal.

The British band Editors refused to participate when they learned about the sponsors of the event.

What is the problem with Yandex?

It is often called the “Russian Google”. It has been accused of manipulating search results and news feeds to favor pro-Kremlin narratives, spreading misinformation and propaganda about the war in Ukraine.

In addition, by paying taxes and providing services to the Russian government, Yandex is indirectly supporting the financial infrastructure of the war and contributing to the suffering of Ukrainians.",r/ukraine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZZHlvY1NzaHNSSGlJUTBmRkhtYWFQTWhBYmNJTHVUclF5VDNoZXI1YlZsUnlwNDZ5bTNMa0V3Q1EtZkFNcUFaLXpFaDI1ZE5Zb3I2akNsd25FYVJ2MVE9PQ==

"Western production is even safer than Russian production because although Ukraine does have some long range drones they produce themselves Russia of course would never dare to attack defense production in the rest of Europe.

And Ukrainian cities are nowhere close to becoming unlivable, and history has shown random attacks on civilians only tend to strengthen their resolve to resist.



As I said Ukraine is dependent on foreign aid to win this war but the difference is the west *can decide* to give that support and give Ukraine the equipment and support they need to win the war, in a couple years at most Russia will be running out of heavy weapons to supply their troops with. *They don't have a choice,* they will simply be out of Soviet era reserves and new production cannot keep pace with demand.


And air defences in Ukraine are being dramatically increased this year with more of new Patriot interceptor production being allocated to Ukraine, an example of the west choosing to increase support and being able to do so. Meanwhile Russia is trying to evade sanctions and paying sky high prices with their ever dwindling foreign currency supply.

> in a couple years at most Russia will be running out of heavy weapons to supply their troops with.

Oh cool, more copium.

Thing is, the Axis of Evil doesn't want russia to lose. China especially, to whom russia needs to set landgrabbing precedent and collect all the pains, so they can prepare accordingly to Taiwan.

Hell, on that, I'll quote ROC directly

[Here you go](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/28/us/politics/taiwan-china-ukraine-aid.html)

>***Joseph Wu, the foreign minister of Taiwan***, said on Thursday that ***a halt in U.S. arms shipments to Ukraine would embolden China in its aggressions against Taiwan and fuel propaganda from Beijing that the United States is an unreliable partner.*** “**When people ask us whether it is OK for the United States to abandon Ukraine, the answer is no, because the world is operating not in a black-and-white way, or if you only look at one theater at a time**,” he said. “The world is interconnected.” **If Russia is able to occupy more of Ukraine and claim victory, he added, “it would be seen as a victory of authoritarian states because Russia, China, North Korea and Iran, they are now linked together.”** Mr. Wu’s comments, made in a wide-ranging hourlong interview in Taipei, come as the Biden administration tries to get Congress to pass a supplemental funding package that would give $60 billion of aid to Ukraine.

>Many House Republicans are staunchly opposed to giving more aid to Ukraine, adopting the “America First” posture embraced by former President Donald J. Trump, a pro-Russia candidate who has pressed them to reject the package. For months they claimed they would be willing to consider providing more assistance for Kyiv if the Biden administration imposed severe immigration restrictions at the United States border with Mexico. But at Mr. Trump’s urging, they balked at a funding package that would have done that, calling the border measures too weak.

>The package also includes $8 billion of aid to counter China in the Asia-Pacific region, $1.9 billion of which would refill stocks of U.S. weapons sent to Taiwan. And it includes $14.1 billion of military aid to Israel. Some Republican lawmakers contend that China is a bigger threat than Russia and that the funding proposed for Ukraine should go toward countering China. But other Republican officials in Congress and many Democrats ***make the same argument as Mr. Wu: that Taiwan’s security is linked to that of Ukraine, because China will see weakness on the part of the United States — and a greater chance of success in a potential invasion of Taiwan — if Ukraine is defeated.*** Chinese leaders have said for decades that Taiwan, a de facto independent island, must be brought under the rule of the Communist Party, by force if necessary. Xi Jinping, China’s leader, has continued to promote that position.

>The U.S. and Taiwanese governments have been trying to deter China from notions of invading Taiwan, including through military buildup in the region and bolstering alliances with other democratic nations. ***If the United States abandons Ukraine, Mr. Wu said, China will “take it as a hint” that if it can keep up sustained action against Taiwan, “the United States is going to back off, the United States and its allies are going to back off.” The thinking among Chinese officials would be this, he said: “OK, since Russia could do that, we can do that as well.”*** “So the U.S. determination in providing support to those countries suffering from authoritarian aggression, it is very important,” Mr. Wu said. After U.S. troops withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021, China pushed propaganda through traditional state-run media and social media that “the U.S. commitment to anything is not firm,” Mr. Wu said. “We suffered from a huge wave of cognitive warfare.”

>China has also spread disinformation stressing Russian narratives of the war, *Mr. Wu said, including the idea that the expansion of NATO forced President Vladimir V. Putin to attack Ukraine,* ***and that the United States is ultimately not committed to supporting Ukraine.***

>On the eve of Russia’s invasion in February 2022, Mr. Putin visited Mr. Xi in Beijing, and their two governments announced a “no limits” partnership. Mr. Wu said some Central and Eastern European nations seeking to forge anti-authoritarian partnerships had strengthened their relations with Taiwan during the war. His comments on the need for the United States to keep supporting Taiwan echo those of other senior Taiwanese officials.** In May 2023, Bi-khim Hsiao, then Taiwan’s de facto ambassador to the United States and now the incoming vice president, made similar arguments to reporters in Washington.*** And in February, Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, Democrat of Illinois, said during a visit of American lawmakers to Taiwan that ***the current president, Tsai Ing-wen***, and the president-elect, Lai Ching-te, made clear to the lawmakers that ***“if for some reason the Ukrainians do not prevail, that will only encourage hostilities against Taiwan.”***

As well as:

>[“Ukraine’s survival is Taiwan’s survival. Ukraine’s success is Taiwan’s success,” Taiwan’s representative in Washington, Bi-khim Hsiao, told the McCain Institute’s Sedona Forum last weekend. “Our futures are closely linked.”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/05/10/taiwan-defense-ukraine-russia-china/)

So yeah.

>And air defences in Ukraine are being dramatically increased this year with more of new Patriot interceptor production being allocated to Ukraine, an example of the west choosing to increase support and being able to do so. 

""Dramatically""

I guess you forget to factor in that Ukraine's SAM grid is weakening overtime in general.

Those S-300 batteries that kept russian fighters and bombers at bay? The will fall silent, once reloads for launchers run out.

And *pledged* Patriots can't protect shit. Only *provided* ones do. But there can easily be gap measured in years between those.

>Meanwhile Russia is trying to evade sanctions and paying sky high prices with their ever dwindling foreign currency supply.

All while [getting sanction waivers to keep trading hydrocarbons, because god forbid sanctions actually biting them](https://www.epravda.com.ua/news/2024/06/26/715786/). 

They still have huge incomes.

Ukrainian economy, meanwhile, is ***DEAD***.

>Russia isn't just fighting Ukraine's economy, they are fighting most of the industrialized worlds economies. 

Which are completely fine with slowly feeding Ukraine to russia, long as it doesn't require much payments.

There's nothing like Lend-Lease ongoing. It's basically scraps to barely hold the line, maybe even getting pushed back a bit, but ***NOWHERE CLOSE*** to being able to push russians out.

>If those countries decide to continue support that fight can never favor Russia, their economy is in freefall and their war effort relies on Soviet era equipment

That's such a tremendous ""***IF***"" I don't think you even grasp the enormity of it.

It was so because they were relatively rare. Now, when T-72 and T-80 stocks are running out, and the T-90 is the only tank in production, they are relatively more common, which affects the number of losses.

"Despite the heat wave, government institutions are prohibited from using air conditioning. Some institutions, like preschools and hospitals, are exempt.

This is one of the latest measures to address the problem of electricity shortages as Russians are targeting Ukrainian vital infrastructure. This report is from the city of Mykolaiv.

The ban on the use of air conditioners has affected the workflow at the city council. Anna Yakymchuk, the chief specialist of the public relations department, says that employees are trying to cope with the heat on their own.

""We open windows to create some draft. Everyone has water, we try to dress as lightly as possible. And when it gets really bad, we go for a walk in the corridor. There's no point in going outside because it's very hot there too,"" says Anna.

Currently, all residents of Mykolaiv have no access to electricity for at least four hours a day.

The new measure was implemented despite the record high temperatures recorded in Mykolaiv.

According to Alina Pylypenko, the leading meteorologist at the Mykolaiv Regional Hydrometeorological Center, the temperature in Mykolaiv reaches +40 degrees Celsius, and on July 10, the highest temperature in the last 80 years was recorded at +40.5 degrees Celsius. This temperature will persist for another two weeks.

According to a government directive, the ban on the use of air conditioners will be in effect until December 31, 2024. For businesses, this ban is advisory in nature.

"Senior Lieutenant Yevhen Osyka was born in Lysychansk, Luhansk region. ""When I was 12 years old, I learned what war is. In the summer of 2014, things were intense for us. Fortunately, Lysychansk was successfully defended. People from the temporarily occupied territories were evacuated to us and shared the horrors they had experienced.""

At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, when he was 20 years old, he joined the assault battalion ""Luhansk-1"". During a combat mission, he was wounded. After treatment and rehabilitation, he continued his service as an investigator in Dnipro. Last year, he and his wife moved to the Khmelnytskyi region. He is currently performing the duties of a juvenile police officer. 

According to Yevhen, he had dreamed of becoming a police officer like his father since childhood.

""I like working in juvenile prevention. It's a special feeling when you understand your role in shaping a new personality."" Yevhen Osyka noted that he visits families in difficult life circumstances, conducts preventive work with them, and helps them cope with difficulties.

""Working with such families is psychologically challenging because you often witness inappropriate treatment of children.""

According to the senior lieutenant, he dreams of a peaceful childhood for all Ukrainian children.

""I know what it's like to be a child of war. I do everything possible to ensure that our children feel safe in these difficult times. I will soon become a father, so I believe that adults must do everything to ensure that the growing generation lives in a free and successful Ukraine.""

">Use ""up or out"" rules on officers. Your either progressing in your military career or its time to leave to let new blood move up.  

In the US we call the resulting phenomenon  ""promoted to the point of incompetence"""" -if you are constantly supporting a system where good officers/leaders are promoted out of their positions for good performance, you ultimately end up with two results:

-Unexperienced officers taking the place of competent officers who have been promoted.

-promoted officers who end up in positions they are not competent in, who stay in those positions due to mediocre or poor performance

>The Peter Principle states that an employee continues to receive promotions to work in higher ranks up to that point where he reaches a level of incompetence. In simple terms, the higher the hierarchy ladder an individual goes, the more likely he is to fail in his new position.

"It goes way past a century. They were a satrap of the Golde Horde for centuries. Russia is an eastern culture in that it derives its political philosophy from authoritarianism and bureaucracy. They tried for a time to mimic the west but it was always artificial and skin deep.

"I think the only way to get them back, realistically, would be a prisoner swap with some of their most notorious RuZ spies in western prisons around the world. 

 But this is unlikely, because even Biden and America couldn't get their people back from RuZ prisons, so far they've only gotten a few low profile hostages back, in exchange for some high value RuZ terrorists. 

So yeah, either a regime change with PutinZ dead or kidnap someone really important to PutinZ, then we'd have a good chance of getting these hostages back.

"The USSR was absolutely a military superpower, but only because it represents the zenith of the ""Russian empire"" - I use quotes because I consider the USSR to be a brief period in an unbroken history of an aggressively expansionist, authoritarian land empire centered on Moscow. 

So here it is at the high water mark of its territorial control, and it's extracting enormous wealth and labor from conquered nations. A lot of it got channeled into the military, but I don't think the collapse of the USSR was inevitable, at least not for that reason.

The USSR was scary because it put the combined power of a huge number of nations in the hands of Moscow. When those nations gained independence, it left the Russian Federation with an inheritance of materiel, but not the industrial base to continue being the superpower the USSR was.

There's a reason why the Russian Navy doesn't build large surface ships anymore, and why it can't maintain the gas turbines in some of its fleet. All that stuff was built in the Ukrainian SSR before the collapse.

"On the front lines, the number of Russian army attacks decreased yesterday, likely due to the rotation of units that had suffered losses.

- On the Kharkiv front, the intensity of the offensive has sharply decreased compared to the previous two days, and isolated attacks were unsuccessful.

- In the Svatove and Severodonetsk areas, attacks on the town of Kupiansk decreased. The activity on the Luhansk front was higher, but there was no success. Comparatively, active attacks continued on the Siversk front, but the situation remains unchanged.

- In the area around Bakhmut, regular attempts to advance on the town of Chasiv Yar and south of Bakhmut continue. The front line has not moved. An active offensive continues towards Toretsk, where Ukrainian units are struggling to maintain their positions around the settlement of New York.

- On the Pokrovsk front, the most intense offensive continues, with attacks occurring around the clock. The Russian army did not manage to make progress yesterday. Main battles are ongoing inside and around the settlement of Krasnohorivka. The intensity of the battles here fluctuates, and the situation remains the same.

- On the southern front, the tempo of the Russian units’ offensive has slowed. The reported retreat of Ukrainian forces from the village of Urozhaine has not been officially confirmed, but it seems plausible. On the east bank of the Dnipro, Russian units are minimally active, and routine attacks on Ukrainian positions have not been successful.",r/ukraine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnR2kyUm9IeVp2RkdsZlVNSm9vY3dQdzFnUFFuQVdocklzd044aTJteFN1RFB4bzVqczZab29rVjhUaHVGWW1kODJnRkRBcnVvTUZLTDZOc1NnUGwtSlE9PQ==

"My suspicion is that pilots are being trained on a 'per role' basis.

Mirage 2000's role is *very likely* to be to lob Storm Shadows, since it's enabled for those missiles. It doesn't carry as many as Su-24 would but it exists and the 24s are likely running down their airworthiness by now. (Not gone, at least less)

So a Mirage pilot *in theory* to be an effective addition only needs to know how to takeoff, land, move to position, and loose a cruise missile from well out of engagement range, with some knowledge to crank and dive from a long range shot at them. If your pressing need to maintain cruise missile throwing is that high, you could cut a lot of roles out of their knowledge if you're never going to be using them for that.

Obviously it's better to be more rounded, but in emergency situations, sometimes you can make that judgement call for a role that is by and large relatively divorced from more intertwined needs.",r/ukraine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnRnU2aEo2S1dWRllRSUZuQ3c1TlF3c2NEYjdRTVhaYnlWU0xlbnRYQk5ET3dwbG9VR21IR0EyamQya2RpMUlzQkFmNk1uWUJIcDhvX3BMYjkxMGgyZFE9PQ==

Due to heavy Russian casualties and successful Ukrainian counter battery fire, Ukrainians have been successful in intensifying the pressure  on this front - especially south of the river where Russian soldiers are cut off.  In addition, Ukraine has made some advances (although it is not yet confirmed).  It's likely these advances will continue due to the depleted strength of the Russian military in this front.

"> I like 39 new tanks for Ukraine. 

I'm not sure that we could call the Leopard 1 ""new"".  It was frankly a bit crap even when it was new given that when it was designed HEAT rounds appeared unstoppable by armour and so the Leopard 1 was basically armoured against machineguns and light cannon fire but otherwise left unarmoured.

The main thing going for it was that it had the effective 105mm L7 gun, and the Germans built like 4500 of them thus helping to offset the sheer numbers of Russian tanks just over the NATO border.

Now it's a 60 year old museum piece that is so far below modern expectations of a tank that the only realistic role for it is sitting well back and sniping with the 105mm L7 as additional firepower.",r/ukraine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnUjEzME1tbFZCMkhwOXQtRHpqeFB5emhfTFVibDZSZ3FNMGlaRFV6cjlETE13a095dmJuX1hBajFIQ0F5eGJqQkJEWlBqSUZQSWdrZl8yVjVTY1NTcjRtZWJmMlFLVHVMUWt5TkZjb3BqTms9
"I already have my report for tomorrow. This will be the section regarding Kharkiv:

""- In the direction of Kharkiv, the activity of Russian forces increased again, with intense but unsuccessful attacks in the areas of Vovchansk and Lyptsi. A few days ago, Ukrainian military intelligence chief General Budanov mentioned in an interview that he expects a new attempt at a northern attack from Russian forces, without providing any specific details about the direction, timing, or size of the forces to be concentrated. This statement has led to various military personnel and observers speculating that the Russian military command has not currently concentrated forces for new directions of attack. It is possible that General Budanov was referring to a new expected wave of attacks in the direction of Kharkiv, as reserves have indeed been brought here to push back Ukrainian forces.""",r/ukraine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnX2JGZ3VWT2VPd1JRVkdQV1BReFhZbnFtX0k0N013WmFpMU1uSWRiQzJybHFuMEFxTkt3dnp2a1QzbnJwbEN2cFo0QVNoT0dzUW9lOGNsb1FHUWhnRFE9PQ==

The logical conclusion to two straight years of burning men and material at completely unsustainable rates.

"This.

It's not that you lose 3 attackers per defender, but you need 3 attackers per defender in rough terms. 

Specifically, you need to take into account weapons, armour, artillery, morale, readiness, and all sorts of numbers to get a calculable score that you then measure against your opponent's score. If you have a higher multiple than 3, then you can attack. 

As for how this came about, it's from Soviet studies Post WW2 that then went on to influence all of their military training and studies. Seriously, if you check out their operational manuals, they have, down to the individual shell, how many you need from mortars to 300mm rockets to kill 50% of a foe. From entrenched infantry, to tanks in column, to fortified defences.

They tried to turn war into a science and that 3-1 score comes from that. 

But, in general terms, because it's not as catchy to say 'you need to compute your  pros and cons against the defenders to identify a 3-1 advantage' compared to 'you need 3-1 odds to win', it's what everyone thinks the 3-1 number is about.",r/ukraine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnOThUZXBfV1hTQUc0X1pFQ0VSTTQxVFdlWXMydk9xLUV5SER2bkJaM3Y0TWdJWVBtSFNTN0QyU0pCUG1TNjZmWGt3Vi1KVXlxX2tCZ180NV9oZVM4Z2c9PQ==

"I'm also willing to take a look (I have a biometric one to compare), but this doesn't sound right to me.

These are international, not Ukrainian standards. If you're concerned, it may be worth asking for a screenshot of the Diia app as the passport should be in there.
