"It's not an advantage. That gun has less range than modern artillery and takes too long to set up and breakdown. There's a reason that the russian losses in artillery are consistently between 50-65 a day last two months, when the daily total from earlier in the war were more like 25-35 a day.

"If the Kremlin acknowledged the death of a mobik, then they would be liable for the death payments to their families. 

Their current government will never acknowledge the actual number of deaths.

"While OSINT is used to corroborate claims,.a lot of these estimates are statistical in mature based on intelligence, troop movements, observation of troops committed, etc. this is intelligence agencies bread and butter. 


The Russian army was probably one of the most monitored forces in the world, and troop strength and structure would have been very well known. The discrepancies cam probably be put down to the quality of intelligence and perhaps a difference I'm methodology.


 It also matters how these casualties are spread out. For example if 3 formations lose 1/3rd of their troops, that's 3 formations that are combat ineffective. If 1 unit is completely destroyed, that's only 1 unit. It's more complicated to refresh a semi destroyed unit than to just replace it with a different one. 


The 500k headline number is a good indication of how badly things are going for Russia, but it needs to be synthesized with other information to get a good picture of the effect of these casualties. 


For example seeing more t64s in action shows a depletion of tank stocks. Seeing the new forces in Kharkiv equipped with motorbikes and quads shows a depletion of infantry vehicles. Observing this on smaller scales allows intelligence agencies to pinpoint the deficiencies of individual units. 


For Russia, 500k is basically nothing, they will just force more and more people into service and not really care because anyone who complains is jailed. So it more shows the determination of Putin to see this out whatever the cost may be. ",r/ukrainewarvideoreport,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYnFoVXM4ejdiMzdmbWp1WkhfdUEzTnZVNTZ2MlpaMmpKOXJxWklLSjlseW5XWEZXOWMxZlp0OV9XRlRISTBsMGQteTdyQklJVlYxcEphMDcxUEUyUXc9PQ==

Though there will absolutely be manpower shortages for the Kremlin mafia, there already is, since drones outnumber them 3/1. and if Putler is forced to mobilise from Moscow & St.Pet then there’s quite a high chance of political collapse.

"At best, that sounds like ignorance, or more like obfuscation if we're being less charitable. The terms still have meanings, and torturing them until those meanings are obscured to the average person only helps extremists.

Liberalism generally concerns itself with equality under the law, personal property rights, and political liberty, downstream from concepts like the free marketplace of ideas and the social contract. Leftism generally concerns itself with curtailing or discarding these things to even out societal heirarchy, securing power and better material conditions for groups perceived as historically disadvantaged.

It doesn't take much political education to realize that aside from some rare leftists who genuinely like the flavor of gradual reform more than that of subversive counter-culture and revolutionary movements, these are largely exclusive viewpoints. And you wouldn't really call those democratic socialists 'far left' anyways, just left.",r/ukrainewarvideoreport,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZQ3R6YjN1YXpJOThOZVNIWXprRFdoYk1MM053ckZJcEVicG50elFoUmEwZmdNMllabHRlV0h0NUNfMEo3Ul9HbU8yN3BWMllpc1ZBS1VJazJWZjFfZnhzUnpGdjI1aTdsd3dRNFh5VHMwMnM9

"It's a complicated issue, but if a government wants to do away with VPN completely, it would use a combination of port matching and (advanced) deep packet inspection. More on that below.

Port matching is obviously flawed, because regardless of VPN protocol used (OpenVPN, IKEv2/IPsec, L2TP/IPsec, PPTP or WireGuard), you can move the connection to a different port if you (somehow) or your friends control the other end outside of the totalitarian country.

So, after dropping every packet matching any protocol/port combination used by any of the aforementioned protocols, you go for deep packet inspection. This is very CPU intensive, so it requires very significant hardware, if you're hellbent on screening all traffic going in and out of your country's internet in/egress points. China and Iran are known to already do/try this.

...To which IT-savvy users respond with obfuscation/scrambling techniques, of which there are several.

It's a cat and mouse game. While I wouldn't assume this game is always won by those who attempt to evade VPN blocks, the Russian government has a lot of work to do if it wants to (attempt to) block VPN completely.

As for smartphone apps blocked in the store, users will [sideload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideloading). Well, on Android, at least. iPhone is more difficult. [Sideloading on iOS was just made available in the European Union after pressure on Apple](https://lifehacker.com/tech/ios-175-brings-iphone-sideloading-to-the-eu).

There are other screening techniques based on data entropy which governments could use, and if you are on your own internet connection at home, you might soon get a visit and an inspection to see what you're up to. It might end badly for you. Again though, the current state of things is that savvy IT experts will usually find their way around the blocking measures. But not without risk.

"I don't think this is necessarily true. 

Sure, if you have no other choice for artillery, you'll use it. But, these are old. Any shells Russia still has from when they produced these are going to be well past their use by date. Anything they get from NK to fire out of these is going to be old and/or of dubious quality.

It causes the same problems Ukraine has been suffering, logistical bottlenecks. Now you need to find the parts and shells for an entirely different system and get it to where it needs to be. If you have one truck supplying both 130mm and 152mm systems, each system only gets so much ammo. And because of their age, the M46s are probably going to need more ammunition to have the same effect on a target as a more modern and accurate system.

">Unfortunately russia probably has access to massive amounts of ammo for these

I don't think they will. They stopped making these in the 70s. As far as I can tell, they switched to 152mm artillery in the early 70s. Their largest stockpiles of field and SP artillery are 122mm and 152mm, with no listed 130mm guns. 

If you're not fielding any 130mm systems, there's no real point in producing 130mm ammo in any significant quantities. Maybe for export or for a few years while other systems were being introduced in significant numbers, but any Soviet shells they still have in storage are probably 30+ years old. Letting explosives sit for decades and then trying to fire them is likely going to lead to some dramatic effects, like the shell blowing up in the barrel.

China and NK both have these systems, so they can produce shells for them. But...their quality is going to be very suspect. I would not want to be a Russian artillery crew man loading a 20 year old NK shell into a barrel that probably hasn't been maintained in 30 years.",r/ukrainewarvideoreport,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZZmNXVFdkRVFtRnppX1I5eHNiQkZZVjhwOGI2UHdqdEN3WWQzMU5tTzlodHlxY0tPaUtCLWRNWHpGNnBuSjlDRGo2OHE3Q01NXzRNZm1aWUN2LU9OaWc9PQ==

"Though this was just released on youtube, this report is from 2023 I think, if not early 2024.

Truthfully, I don't think they believe that internally and the reason they aren't ""calling a spade a spade"" is because there's a geopolitical chess game happening right now and now isn't the time plus this isn't the issue to kick shit off over considering the bigger picture evolving before the entire world's eyes right now.

"Well, it's true. War economies are great for nations...in the short term. Lots of jobs, lots of money in industries, lots of investment.

"I'm sure that Ukrainians are taking casualties and every one is a tragic loss, but I'm also sure that there are many many soldiers who, through experience, have ramped up their level of expertise and are in a position to pass it on to newer soldiers and help them stay alive and be effective. 

I think the situation may me not equal on the Russian side. Fewer front line soldiers stay alive long enough to learn anything and the massive losses they have suffered means a loss of experience and institutional knowledge that cascades through the system. On top of various corruption related factors I'm hoping that the whole rotten system is just degrading over time and it will be higher and higher losses for fewer and fewer gains. Two and a half years in and the invaders are taking months to advance a few kilometers in narrow zones of intense effort and not moving at all in most of the thousand mile front.",r/ukrainewarvideoreport,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZR1RfaElOd2lpeldLckZsNkVYbUFWTTJBQ0VWdEhGRmV6eFNnSGhKZmwxWEZHYkF3S0s2OFRrdFhUeHRMMWJsaFlhczBRYjVTdU5UUVNURXdLR0hScmk4M0lzZEd3Q0hWT2J0QlY5SFRZWWM9

"Once, just out of idle interest, I decided to visualize the scale of WW2 lend-lease. I copied and pasted a little icon of a plane onto a document, then recopied and re-pasted into blocks of 100 and then copied and pasted until it was 18,200 aircraft, which is how many were supplied to the USSR under lend lease. I did the same with trucks and jeeps. (400,000) It was pages and pages of tiny little icons all neatly organized into rows and columns. Page after page after page.

"Errr, the defense industry requires skilled and educated workers, like the middle-upper class kids that left Russia in 2022. They don't need the uneducated, unskilled and lazy fodders that PutinZ is recruiting for war. 

2.8 unemployment of mostly skilled and educated jobs, again, not the fodders. 

Emptying prisons is just another no brainer for RuZ, more unskilled fodders, no need to pay for their upkeep after death, win-win. 

Monetary incentives = best way to bait the uneducated, unskilled and lazy fodders. 

Foreign mercenaries = even more uneducated, unskilled and lazy fodders. Cheaper than local fodders due to exchange rate with these poor countries (Nepal, Africa, etc)

Kharkiv ran out of manpower because it was badly planned and a diversion tactic, not a serious new offensive. PutinZ want Donbas, Kherson and Zaporizhya, doesn't really care about Kharkiv. 

Plus their equipment and ammo logistic is terrible and can't catch up with the fodder recruitment, it will take time, but eventually they will make enough shyt to equip them. 

Sure, I dont have the super secret intel on Russia's fodder recruitment and internal statistics, but based on most expert's analysis, they still have a few million fodders to throw at this war, plus the resources to sustain them, at least for 5-10 years. Ukraine cannot match this attrition rate, even if they have 1:5 kill ratio. Zombies are dumb and slow, but with 3x more zombies than UKR has soldiers, they will eventually make huge progress over time. 

The ONLY way to win this is with RuZ economic collapse, because no money = no weapons/ammo = zombies can't fight. Again, to do this the West MUST deal with India and China, to find a way to make them reject RuZ. 

The stick doesn't work on India and China, so I suggest the carrot, make them a MUCH better counter offer than RuZ.",r/ukrainewarvideoreport,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZZm1feThqUlVSV0xXMXdGWENTX3V0Q3I3a05iS3p1VzZ0WjladzlPem9ydzJXenNrcklYN25CSzBSbkRzTlJaUWc2ZmtMWk1MNDlPcm5sVEp4NmtiX3FyNmtEVllIMzhVNEFvcHdJd0l2Rlk9

"I find that interesting, maybe it's just something you don't really see in the micro, but even back in 2023 people were claiming Russia was running low on shells. And then we got to Bakhmut, where they had enough ammo, to fire upwards of 10 shells even on individual soldiers. 

At one point we split up, because we were hoping that a guy walking on his own would not be worth spending so much ammo on, and both of us despite a 10 minute distance to each other were shelled the entire way back to our position. 

The biggest barrage I heard fired (luckily not at us) was over thirty guns. 

Meanwhile our own artillery fired at most 10% of what the Russians shot. 

So what is it? Are they running out of guns and shells, or are they just recruiting more people and these units need equipment.

"Barrel Life is the number of ""full"" loads a barrel can endure before barrel wear reduces precision too much and, more importantly, poses a risk due to premature detonation of the shell in the barrel.

If you only use e.g. half the amount of propellant charge, the effective barrel Life will be more than 5000 shots, because barrel wear isn't linear to the size of the charge.

However, every shell fired causes wear and sooner or later, the barrel will not provide a tight seal anymore, it will leak gas, leading to inconsistent firing patterns (some shells may have a better seal than others, especially with shells manufactured to questionable tolerances such as those from North Korea).

Re-barreling a worn-out gun isn't a big deal if you have good quality steel and the tools to do so. Since Russia doesn't produce the shells for that system anymore, they also don't produce the system itself. Chances are that the tooling and machinery has long been sold/scrapped/turned into a yacht. So either they'll have workable guns for a few weeks, or they will have to set up an entire production line for 130mm barrels.

My guess is that they'll just burn through the guns and then move on to the next legacy system.",r/ukrainewarvideoreport,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZSTVFSmxiSzlXSHdRTkFDeDBwNkhiaHd4MVAycVR2eS1LV0RTWTV6dF9EeTJ2N2tpTzJxMGpPcm52amNPSFZoS05Vckl2blZFVHc4NUpOOUxGNE56MV92Xy02d0huTTFLbDBuR2dDdmxsdlk9

"Not ""just collapse"" but when the casualties are so high that russia will struggle to fill the gaps, it will become evident for the russian people that how badly the war is going. This recruitment of Indians, North-Koreans, Africans, etc is just one the last tricks he has before he has to admit that they are running out of cannon fodder.

Currently russia is hiding everything under the endless and inefficient bureaucracy, blocking media, imprisoning people if they say anything and pushing constant propaganda how """"russia is winning"""". Small losses like 1000 soldiers per day will not even reach the homefront, nobody back home knows how hundreds die each day.

Things will be different when those thousands will start surrendering *en masse* and russia has to deploy every reserve to keep Ukraine from advancing.. Not much chances of being able to hide that and Putin would have to answer difficult questions he don't have answers for.

Nobody realistically expects russian lines to ""just collapse"" and the army to stop and go home. It's not going to happen. But there are other outcomes then just 'either or'...

 Trump is servile to Putin because it opens up space for him to take an interest in political activity in the world.

And with a strange policy, he sided with the authoritarian, dictatorial regimes of North Korea, Russia, Belarus, Hungary and Serbia, giving them a free hand to do whatever they want, creating chaos in relations between neighbors.

"OK so fair enough for those who are pointing out that this may indicate that Russia is running out of more recent weapons systems. But what I don't get, or necessarily agree with, is that just because these systems are older, that this somehow implies they are also somehow useless? These weapons (and many other older systems) were capable of inflicting mass death and injury when they were made, and as far as I can see, that's unlikely to have changed despite their age. NATO and other Western alies often have some very old weapons systems in their inventory. But we kept them because in many cases they have proven their usefulness many times over - and in some cases in actual combat position. 

Sure, a lot of these guns would probably need extensive servicing, but I don't think it's beyond Russia's capacity to undertake this work.

Anyway, no doubt some numbnuts will downvote this statement (there's a segment of the Reddit population who just don't like reality, it seems), even though I'm an ardent supporter of the Ukrainian cause and I would like all of these things destroyed as quickly as possible.

But we've been hearing almost since the start of this war that 'Russia is running out of weapons' and every week or two we hear this statement repeated once again. What I don't like about it is that making this assumption might lead to complacency - a complacency that might ultimately be reflected in the press and the public at large. If that happens, the danger is that we will continue to underestimate the resources that Ukraine undoubtedly needs to put an end to this thing for once and for all.",r/ukrainewarvideoreport,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZY180UE9yQkxaTmx5TGZuUHllanNJYWllRF9YVXZDaVZCWXNxZnNPSEk5dGZUazRnRVNuU3N5cm95TXo3aDBvaUVSdjJqdWZjTVVKdFVGaHQ5cHdkN2c9PQ==

"It's a tough thing to talk about sometimes. Lots of people with little knowledge but a black-and-white conception of technology and chip on their shoulder for whatever nation, strategy, or weapon they think is supreme.

Like in this case, it's always 'drones will completely take over future battlefields and everything else will be obsolete', or 'this one thing will render all drones completely useless', or something like that. The reality is often something more like 'a range of different solutions at different levels of organization are going to make this new thing less of a gamechanger, but it will probably still be a common threat going forward'.

So in this case, for discussion's sake, we imagine that future armored assaults can reliably be made mostly safe from drone attacks; basic armored vehicles will have last-ditch active protection systems like Trophy, mobile jammers, and remote weapon stations optimized to target drones. You support them with a modern drone oriented mobile air defense like a Slinger, Stryker SHORAD, MADIS, or the like. Large enough swarm attacks may be able to overwhelm the defenses, but the ease of destroying armored assaults using cheap FPV drones is greatly lessened.

Even in this case, drones are still going to be everywhere, cheaply and freely attacking dismounted infantry and equipment anywhere that doesn't have a high concentration of C-UAS systems.

"> his own FBI, CIA and NSA agencies all agreed that the evidence clearly supported that Putin absolutely interfered with U.S. elections.

There may be evidence that Putin interfered with U.S. elections. But what has Trump to do with it? with the same succes Putin could try to help Clinton win.   
  And if there is evidence, why Trump is not in jail? why he is not prosecuted? they tried to prosecute him for a 30 old pornstar case, but can't prosecute him for the things that happened a few years back. And with the support of FBI, CIA and NSA?

All this Russia interference was spined only after Trump won. Because democrats could not belive that Hilary lost, and they started to search for an excuse.  
  
Paul Mannafort should be in jail. But he was in politics long before Trump.  
  Roger Stone was fired by Trump in 2015.  
  Can't find info's about Center Page.   
  
  Again, there is no evidence that Trump is a russian asset. Or he would be already in jail. By your logic Trump is some kind of mastermind 4d chess player, that is working for Putin but still holding the post of the President of America.

"Trump is so obviously compromised by Russia it's ridiculous.

**June 2013**: Trump tweets ""Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow - if so, will he become my new best friend?""

**September 2013**: “So we’ve invited President Putin, that’ll be interesting. I know he’d like to go.”

**October 2013**: Trump tells Larry King that Putin has done “a really great job outsmarting our country.”

**November 2013**: Trump says “I do have a relationship and I can tell you that he’s very interested in what we’re doing here today. He’s probably very interested in what you and I are saying today, and I’m sure he’s going to be seeing it in some form, but I do have a relationship with him and I think it’s very interesting to see what’s happened.”

**February 2014**: “When I went to Russia with the Miss Universe pageant, (Putin) contacted me and was so nice. I mean, the Russian people were so fantastic to us,” he said on “Fox and Friends.” “I’ll just say this, they are doing – they’re outsmarting us at many turns, as we all understand. I mean, their leaders are, whether you call them smarter or more cunning or whatever, but they’re outsmarting us. If you look at Syria or other places, they’re outsmarting us.”

**April 2014**: “We just left Moscow,” Trump said. “He could not have been nicer. He was so nice and so everything. But you have to give him credit that what he’s doing for that country in terms of their world prestige is very strong.”

In the same interview, Trump praises Putin’s invasion of Crimea.

“Well, he’s done an amazing job of taking the mantle,” Trump said. “And he’s taken it away from the President, and you look at what he’s doing. And so smart. When you see the riots in a country because they’re hurting the Russians, OK, ‘We’ll go and take it over.’ And he really goes step by step by step, and you have to give him a lot of credit.”

**April 2014**: Trump says at a New Hampshire event that Putin is “absolutely having a great time.” He says “Russia is like, I mean they’re really hot stuff” and “and now you have people in the Ukraine — who knows, set up or not — but it can’t all be set up, I mean they’re marching in favor of joining Russia.”

**May 2014**: ”I own Miss Universe, I was in Russia, I was in Moscow recently and I spoke, indirectly and directly, with President Putin, who could not have been nicer, and we had a tremendous success.”

**2014**: James Dodson, a sports writer, claims that during a game of golf Eric Trump said to him: ""Well, we don’t rely on American banks. We have all the funding we need out of Russia.""

**March 2015**: Trump tells the Daily Mail about his relationship with Putin: “the relationship is great, and it would be great if I had the position I should have.”

**September 2015**: Trump tells reporters at Trump Tower that “Putin is a nicer person than I am.”

**October 2015**: Trump tells conservative radio host Michael Savage he’s met Vladimir Putin.

**December 2015**: Trump says at an event in South Carolina that Putin says he’s “brilliant.” And attacks his opponents, saying, “they want me to refute his statement.”

[And many more along those lines](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2017/03/politics/trump-putin-russia-timeline/).

**December 2016**: One of Europe's top intelligence figures puts together the Steele Dossier, reporting that Putin has blackmail on Trump, allegedly for something he did in a hotel room in Russia in 2013 during the Miss Universe visit.

Trump flips to claiming he's never met or spoken to Putin. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxYE9ZpMPGY&t=25s

**September 2016**: During the 2016 presidential debates: ""**I don't know Putin**. I have no idea,"" Mr Trump said. ""**I never met Putin.** This is not my best friend.""

When Hillary Clinton said it was ""pretty clear"" Mr Putin would ""rather have a puppet as president of the United States,"" Trump replied with: “No puppet. No puppet. You’re the puppet. You’re the puppet.""

Followed by years of Trump praising Putin, the only world leader he never criticizes while constantly criticizing democratic countries and allies. Refusing to implement sanctions on Russia for its hacking of the US which were passed with a veto proof majority. Attempting to blackmail Ukraine with having to invent something on Biden or having aid withdrawn. Declaring he's decided to believe Putin over his US intelligence agencies. 

**February 2022**: Trump calls Putin ‘genius’ and ‘savvy’ for Ukraine invasion

"“Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge.
But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.”

"The VP-7M and VP-22 fuzes used in the PG-7 rockets after 1968 are not really a good choice for FPV drones which is why they aren't used I'm guessing. They are armed by inertia, and require the warhead to be fired or accelerated at a pretty high g force in order to actually arm themselves. The second issue is that they also have self destruct mechanisms built in to detonate the warhead after I believe 5 seconds of the fuze being armed. Ignoring both of those, the fuze tends to only work at angles of impact <60 degrees, which is obviously not great for detonating FPV drones on a glancing hit or when impacting something soft like mud. The metal cap is in place to prevent the crystal from getting crushed in transit and ruining the projectile iirc.",r/ukrainewarvideoreport,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZDVHQjR4X3BrUXNTQTZpS1djOEJyRFQ2bGxGSjlxU0ttLUJEYlNTOFZpNFBHMzdyNmNDMW1PSzJzNWhaWDcxX0Nkd2FfdWZpOW40N3FpMHZRaW5Gc0E9PQ==

"NVIDIA : You don't get to be the worlds most valuable company by not selling your soul to your and your countries and the free worlds worst enemy for every goddamn cent you can possibly make, said the CEO of NVIDIA to the NYSE and the stockholders meeting. Probably! And every other chip manufacturer that is responding to similar upticks in its sales to the Chines & ruZZian satellite states markets.

Money talks & bullshit walks, when toxic capitalism reaches its peak performance. Making millions or billions in profit sure helps to assuage the conscience of the directors of companies profiteering from the death & misery being inflicted on friendly countries by our enemies. Even the Swiss bankers today still celebrate their banks good fortunes stemming from the deposits of Jewish gold by the Nazis during WWII.

Whether Jewish gold teeth, works of art, or 21st century microelectronics, only bank robbery is more lucrative than war time capitalism. Humans, such a wonderful species.

">epileptic seizure in man, known as a grand mal epileptic fit, during which the brain is severely stimulated, the body exhibits tonic/clonic activity, and there is complete loss of consciousness. During the first (tonic) phase, when current flows through the brain, the animal collapses and stops breathing, with the front legs extended rigidly and the hind legs flexed into the body. The second (clonic) phase sees the animal relax and start involuntary kicking of both the fore and hind legs. As the clonic activity subsides, the animal moves into the third (recovery or exhaustion) phase.

It is recognised that while an animal is in the first two phases it is unconscious and, therefore, insensible to pain. However, the onset of the third phase is an indication that the animal is beginning to recover and may be able to experience pain. The first sign that an animal is recovering from the effect of the stun is a return to normal rhythmic breathing. Rhythmic breathing can be determined by watching for the rise and fall of the chest, with evenly spaced breaths. This should not be confused with random gasping (agonal breathing), a result of spasmodic muscle contractions, which can occur when the brain is dying. During these random contractions, air can also be forced from the lungs, causing the animal to make involuntary noises.",r/ukrainewarvideoreport,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhd3MwRDY5bWdySXVETVdtYVZyWkFoM0ZqTkdjY3hGRGhlc01WZ0d3VjZyUm5QMDdDVVBTNzhYV1IwR2w4SW42dTY3RllYbUhHNDF3YWZFVkVHMkZzemc9PQ==
