You should try looking at a map to see how much advancing they're actually doing.

They're throwing huge numbers of men at positions to overwhelm defenders, taking huge casualties in the process, and still only capturing a few individual fighting positions.

"I would generally agree with your sentiment. But would like to add that civil type wars are very difficult for outsiders/foreigners to understand.

"Let us not forget that in WW2, Churchilll once said Stalin complained to him about opening a second front. He said that the British Empire and the Americans planned to bleed Russia dry to the last drop of Russian blood.

The Russians have the same talking point today because they are uncreative, and I do not think the plan is to bleed Ukraine dry, but our strategy is in my opinion wrong, unethical and dangerous due to chaos theory. 

The only ethical war, if there is one, is fast and overwhelming, like an operation desert storm.

Our approach is clearly a way to play this game of chess. But it is also a gamble. Time will tell whether this turns out the way we want it to turn out. 

We don't have just idiots in our ranks though, people in this line of work deal in probabilities and mountains of data, and they always have the short, medium, and long-term strategic objectives in mind. 

In the short term, this is bad for Ukraine, and it's kind of bad for Russia. In the long term, we will help Ukraine to rebuild and transform their economy, while Russia will wither away. Or so, at least, seems to be the line of thinking.

One thing that disturbs me is entropy, the trend of the universe towards chaos and disorder.

For example, the nuclear power plant in Enerhordar is a ticking time bomb. I do understand the approach. I do not approve of it from a moral point of view. But morals have no place in the world of geo-politics. 

In this world, resources, power, geography, and long term advantages matter. It is called the US led alliance. Therefore, it profits the US in some way to do it like that, and it surely also profits close allies, it surely doesn't profit Ukraine.

It seems the goals are.

1) Bleed Russia dry and prevent the war from spreading beyond Ukraine

2) Slowly but systemically destroy the Russian economy and cause massive attrition, but make sure that their oil and natural gas is being pumped and distributed as long as possible.

3) Restore Ukraine's sovereignty and eventually let them join NATO and the EU.

In this exact order.",r/ukrainianconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZdTd0OUl3eHFIZERTYXB4Z19zSVlJQ2VsaTlfX0M4YVh1NEpfQ2FDclljdGJNLWZZbjk3X1lOX2JHT201dVRKV1RKdlNWQ09ldnQ2SXlRX01ualVrOGc9PQ==

"Why does the global South put up with China's sterilization of Muslims or Russia's genocide?  

Because western civilization (especially the British with their navy ending slavery) invented modern human rights at the end of an era where colonization was glorious (and lifted the rest of the world from stone/middle age to middle industrial, from GDP to life expctancy to political and human rights), and then promptly entered an extremely oikophobic post zenith plateu phase (humans need an enemy to form their identity against, and at the peak of its power a civilization can grow powerful enough to not have any serious rivals) where it's citizens love to polarize and hate other groups within their civ more than those outside it, or even hate their civilization itself to automatically make themselves better than everyone else around them... in such a situation the values that have been adopted by the West have not been adopted by most of the other civilizations and is happily used as a whip against the West for further benefit. 

If Russia and China do not care about criticism of their ethnic cleansing, there's no benefit for the Global Soutj to hammer about values they themselves have adopted partially at best. 

This is the global South that the West has helped so much while wallowing in self hatred despite that time period doing more for the rest of the world demographically than literally any other.

"TLDR: The West is very anti-racist, to the point it is often actually racist against itself.
The South and East are very racist.

Source: myself, I'm half Hong Kong and lived half my life (20 years) in HK and predicted Erdogan/Putin/Chavez/Berlusconi in 2002. 
Even in a modern city like HK people will call whites ""ghosts, ghost lady, ghost children"" and most don't even get that it's offensive. In the West I've only experienced racism twice, from children only. 

The fact of the matter is that until recently 2022 if China and Russia and Islamists sterilized/murdered/raped someone, if you called them out on it, you'd be called a racist or an Islamophobe, to the point children in Rotherham and women in Cologne were told to shut upby social workers and fellow feminists (a good ideology, the first wave, but they sure know they are below racism on the pecking order). 

Not to mention that western colonialism itself massively benefited the entire world, at the cost of occasional genocide and oppression (although it also removed stone age internecine warfare) and sent all demographic arrows from economy, to health to political institutions straight up, quite unlike Ukraine... what matters is that during this time the West developed extreme good humanist ideas that it took to the extreme and further decided that the rest of the world exemplified while the West was the antithesis... this was due to oikophobia which happens in civilizations where there are no enemies to form your identity against (thus people will hate other factions within the same civilization or their civilization itself to automatically be better than everyone around them). 

Nevermind that the British Empire canceled slavery and enforced it with their navy and that no other civilization or country has ever done this. 

It's not a complex story to most of the people jn this world, it's just how to get the most popularity and benefits, and if the West decides that it is racist and evil and the actually racist parts of the world are innocent victim saints then guess what...? They'll capitalize on it.

Fact of the matter is you can commit as much genocidea and sterilization as you want in this world and if you're a large, powerful state that doesn't care about it (especially autocracies( you can shut up your critics. It's not racism/colonialism/appropriation/whatever according to these hack scholars if Chinese sterilize Uighurs, or Russians do it to white Ukrainians or they do it themselves, it's only if it's an outgroup does it to an ingroup (in this case that goes for the West and vs the rest of the world being the ingroup (Ukraine, Israel), but you can also substitute with whatever gender or race or faith, as long as it's beneficial.

Yes, the global South, heroic victims of the West would if they saw Europe and North America devastated by war, rape and famine by invaders, they would say that it's not racism because they consider us villains, never to be victims. It doesn't matter one lick to them if Ukrainians are raped to death and the world was brought up to early modernity, Westerners are the racists and the war profiteering global South are victims. 

I wish some aliens would colonize us like the West did.

"Absolute nonsense, the West has worked less with Russia than the Global South and done more to help it's victims, and has opposed Russia in Syria.
And while the war in Iraq was mishandled and has a false CB, it fundamentally removed a brutal dictator. 

Frankly, you're just an oikophobic racist. It doesn't matter to you if the West did it's best for Syria, and literally ended slavery via the British navy unlike any other civilization, and invented all these rights during it's zenith while it was in charge unlike any other civilization before it dismantling itself partly for political reasons (despitw a thousand to thousands of years of demograpgic gains gained in as little as one century, ending internecine warfare, and economy, population, life expectancy, and eventually political and human rights, before any of these new values took over) and flagellating themselves like idiot oikophobes.

Fact of the matter is before modern humanism took charge in the West the West was a fairly benign empire with massive, even insane demographic gains and occasional evil which was considered honorable by tbe standards of the time. 

Oikophobes since then couldn't find any enemy to identify themselves against and decided on other factions, and even their own civilization. Sounds like you if you're western. 
People who flagellate themselves like idiots even as they support the rest of the world constantly with foreign aid, debt forgiveness and help in both Syria and Ukraine will naturally be accused by war profiteering racists who help Russians massacre Ukrainian of being racists with whatever idiotic arguments available.

Whether the person arguing for it is an oikophobic westerner or a southerner doesn't really matter, they are racist either way and don't care about Ukraine or Syria, or the Uighurs or what's happening in Ethioia or Sudan.

"The ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced nazi or the convinced communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction (e.g. the standards of thought) no longer exist."" The origins of totalitarianism by Hannah Arendt

In comparison of the Soviet and Nazi regimes Hannah Arendth wrote in 1951 that factuality itself depends for its continued existence upon the existence of a non totalitarian world.

George Kennan diplomat in Moscow:

""Here men determine what is true and what is false.""

No thousands of years of ignorance and a lack of education paired with no knowledge of the world and those that know nothing must believe everything.

Therefore, what does it matter why they support Russia? They do, and we must not be friends with every nation, that was a stupid concept anyway.

Our rules based system made the nation hood of many of these places possible in the first place, we provided energy, capital and food to places that never had any, all safeguarded by the US and allied navies. Ungrateful and insolent are apt adjectives to describe the behavior of the Global South, in my view. Moral free, deviant, treacherous, and untrustworthy, that is how we should view those who side with Russia.

Those who play by our rules can stay, and those who wish to not play by our rules will not continue to reap the benefits of our rules based system. The Global South can make their own system. I am actually quite tired of pretending that anyone who has not yet understood that Russia must be opposed is not our enemy because frankly, those who we did not convince thus far, we will never convince. 

Diplomacy is the art of telling people to go to hell in such a way that they ask for directions. Winston S. Churchill

Therefore, India and the others can go to hell. We can show them the way. The hell is Russian and Chinese rule, enjoy. We owe the global South NOTHING, and we never have. They can choose to work with us against Russia or against us with Russia. These are the two available options.

We should not allow for neutrality as option three. There is no way to be neutral about this barbarism. Neutrality is aiding the oppressor never the oppressed. And if someone thinks Russia is the victim, then they are beyond hope.",r/ukrainianconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZNnVhaklaUnZzY2I1dElHLVA5M1pCTDdUSEZweGRKWDcwaFRlWGtWU2djeElTeEJnQTE4d1NPeVdka0pmQXhvREVoRXZoWGJ5ZW1yTktMajg2NjdyQUE9PQ==

"Well... what do you prefer?

Do you want Germans to care about at least two stories a week about why they are dumb and stupid and have no clue and fail to support Ukraine because they are actually just waiting for Russia to win and cooperate with them again (any day now... trust me...)?

Or do you want Germans to give a fuck about narratives and keep being Ukraine's by far biggest European supporter?

Call me smug, but I would advice you live with it. The alternative isn't better. Imagine what happens when Germans start caring for all those stories of always being wrong no matter what they actually do (and it's a simple fact that people love to downplay or even straight out deny their contributions as well as telling stories about those clueless morons not understanding that there is a war in Europe).

"Well thank you for a thoughtful response.

You say that although the war in Iraq was ‚Äúmishandled‚Äù it fundamentally removed a brutal dictator. Well, I would question your characterization of 500,000-600,000 DEAD civilians as ‚Äúmishandled.‚Äù The number of dead civilians is 10x-30 higher than in Ukraine today- yet- no one in the west is prosecuted in court for committing war crimes- which attacking another nation without a UN Security Council Resolution is an ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù war and a war crime- so- if your evaluation is at best- ‚Äúmishandling‚Äù I would question your ability to evaluate events especially in their legal context.

I would vehemently disagree that I am an oikophobic racist- but if that‚Äôs your opinion- that‚Äôs fine- but an unsupportable assertion.

Your diatribe about the British, slavery and Syria- yeah it‚Äôs beyond me- I don‚Äôt get the point or connection you are ‚Äútrying‚Äù to make.

I think the remainder of your history lesson is not at all tangent to the discussion at hand- of why the Global South has realized a lack of legitimacy of Western leadership- especially when it comes to a rules based system and the rule of international law- and thus, in a strategic paradigm- that of self-defence- they might be siding with Putin- as Putin- in its ‚Äúillegal‚Äù invasion of Ukraine- is copying the Bush Doctrine- i.e. Pre-emptive attack- a doctrine SET by the Americans and President George Bush- something you conveniently ignore.

¬†

I absolutely celebrate the superior Western enlightened democracies as the ONLY beacon for the rest of the authoritarian world to follow, that, however, does not mean we turn a blind eye to fundamental strategic mistakes of stark hypocrisy by the West when it consistently violates the rules based system but then- selectively asks the world to follow them.¬† Sounds like your bias is an inability for OBJECTIVE self-assessment.

In terms of your ‚Äúthrowing‚Äù around the word- racists- as if to step onto your high-horse PEDESTAL, be more humble please- the Ukraine is RIFE with neo-Nazi‚Äôs and a substantial far-right movement- and has been for the last two decades. In fact, ‚Äú MOST ‚Äú of the national guard brigades fighting in Eastern Ukraine are clearly Neo-Nazi units, displaying unmistakable Nazi iconography and well known far-rights commanders. All that does not EXCUSE Putin for illegally invading Ukraine- but its‚Äô better to have some ‚Äúbalance‚Äù in your USE of ‚Äúracists‚Äù as you make a cheap attempt to WIN an argument by playing the identity card- won‚Äôt work.

Shielding war profiteers? Hah? Huh? Yeah try re-explaining that one- hardly the case.

I am for sure criticizing nations who turned a blind eye to Putin‚Äôs thuggery of two decades- yet continued a normal relationship and as I already mentioned, handing him TRILLIONS of Euros for cheap energy- yup- the chickens have come home to roost and Putin wouldn‚Äôt have re-built his army without the Europeans having such ROBUST trade with an authoritarian bully like Putin- I‚Äôll criticize that all day long- as it should be.",r/ukrainianconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZZEhsa2h3WTgwZmhuZHFSTnVNRjZBRk82TmJFU3U4V2ZIQm1EZFZMYUJYTUh5WUV4TjdMR1ZpeUgxVEJGV09paFRqanNkS1ZEZ09iUDI3U19SN1BtUVE9PQ==

"Well India is the largest democracy and FYI Modi's party formed the government with coalition which means other party leaders of India have faith in Modi and his diplomacy and which he didn't force it upon them.

During the 1971 Ind-Pak war where the US and the World sided with Pakistan and India was destined to lose it was Russia who sent submarines to defend our country.

In 1962(Sino-Indian war) the Soviet Union agreed to transfer technology to co-produce the MIG jet fighter in India, which helped India to protect its sky.

And when the world sanctioned Russia we are standing beside them, I don't see where the problem is?We never promoted war or helped Putin with his war efforts.If fact we are the only one nation talking directly with Putin to STOP the war.

We are not the only one buying cheap oil there are a lot of other European nations as well and they are also purchasing natural gases (~$18 B).EU is the second highest buyer of oil and gases from Russia after China

Russia and Indians have deep ties which would get stronger day by day. We Don't Trust the West at all. They are all greedy and all they care about is profit.India is still a developing nation only because Britain looted us, took every last penny and left us only with skeleton.Let me give you a example how rich India was, in 1937 nawab of Hyderabad was the richest person in the world (officially recognised by times magazine). So we don't want the west to decide for us who should be our friends and who not. And lets not forget what crimes US did in Iran Iraq and Syria, killing thousands of children, woman and men. where was the media then?

I have sympathy for people who lost their lives in the Ukraine Russia conflict but that doesn't mean Indians should follow what the west does Russia is our friends and we stand beside them.

"The strategist in me wonders how good of an idea this is.

Don't get me wrong, Putin deserves his comeuppance for his multitude of crimes against humanity in Ukraine, but him meeting his end from an assassin's bullet risks turning him into a martyr. If there was a reasonable chance that Putin dying would end this war, it would be worth it, one million percent; but, from what I've seen, I don't think that's the case. Quite to the contrary, the Ukrainians killing the Russian leader would likely enrage the Russians and get them to commit to the war even more than they already are. By all accounts, the ones most likely to take power in the event of Putin's death are, if anything, more bloodthristy than he is - I can't see them willingly pulling back and surrendering, given the circumstances.

Personally, I'm hoping that Putin dies to Russian insurrectionists - that would stand a good chance of collapsing the Russian state and give Ukraine its best opportunity to reclaim its stolen land.",r/ukrainianconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZX3ViOUtwekt5Uklld3VOY1lRdmFwU2RjMXRiQVpfRVhLTjdRaGUwbERRbnFLNzUyNGpKQXFpVkowMU9ZdE80NzJkamtkUGd6Yld2eGUwM0dDbjBfalE9PQ==

"> Simply being the new guy does not make the war magically winnable via some means that Putin hasn't already tried.

> If the new guy wants to own a signature policy of disaster they can continue the war, but if they want to flush it away with Putin and pin it all on the last guy then it's the perfect opportunity to do so.

This is why it's murky territory for me. A lot of whether or not Putin's successor will want to continue the Ukraine war depends on who his successor is. 

We don't actually know who that might be for sure. Putin's in a position where despite his age, he doesn't have a clear successor. There's some speculation about maybe this person or that person will take the top spot, but it's not a clear thing. 

Because of that, it's not actually clear what the attitudes of the Russian government will be if Putin is successfully assassinated. Maybe they'll decide to back off because they realise the war isn't the roaring success they assumed it would be in 2022, but it could also galvanise the government and make them stay in Ukraine. 

We also don't know if it'll be a clean transition of power. It is possible that a controversy over who gets to be the next Russian president could lead to a new Russian civil war. That'd be dangerous ground due to Russia's nuclear capability and the possibility of the war spilling over to neighbouring countries. 

This could be the best possible situation for Ukraine because if Russia's embroiled in a civil war, then they aren't necessarily going to be able to continue the invasion. That could allow for them to recapture all the occupied territories relatively easily. 

However, it's also true that it could be a smooth transition and that Ukraine won't get that opportunity. If it's a smooth transition of power and the new president wants to continue the war, then it'd just be business as usual as far as the war's concerned.",r/ukrainianconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZUUlVbFBRUm40aUxoZmhCMVRZT0pnREE4WVBlbmNTZW5OdFF1TmtRcGJXVzc0b0RxTmtNbERUeE9WdjFUR0VKUnpSN2dHUi1NTTFQYmFEb29ndGNpbmJKUmtoT3JUQnRncWh3RjlXNUlBMTQ9

"Let's put it this way:  
Putin said there are 700k in the zone of the special military operation.  
  
A remarkable share will not return from there except as sunflower seeds or feral hogs.  
(I would have there a business plan with ebay: sunflower seeds certified from Bakhmut, Vovchansk, you name it ...)  
  
Two headlines from the Russian press from the last two days:  
‚ÄúWe were offered to buy ourselves a medal at Wildberries (Russian counterpart of Amazon) for 550 rubles (USD 5.90)‚Äù: a special military operation veteran - about endless contracts and lack of money
(Shkulev network, 20+ regional websites in Russia)  
""Tatarstan introduces ‚Äòfinders fee‚Äô for persuading others to enlist in Russian military""
https://www.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/1e0m9qv/tatarstan_introduces_finders_fee_for_persuading/  
This is from Novaya Gazeta.  
But I have read this also also on the Russian propaganda station website ""Govorit Moskva"":  
""The campaign ‚ÄúBring a friend to the military registration and enlistment office‚Äù began in Tatarstan  
For inviting friends or relatives to contract service, residents of the region will receive 100 thousand rubles. ...""  
I have lost the source (or have to do a lengthy search) for:  
Tatarstan (one of the richest regions in Russia) has increased the payments for **new** contract soldiers to 1 million rubles  
(10k Euro).  
So it could be that they have to struggle to fulfill the expected figures.
Today I was on topwar ru and there was an article about the alleged pro-Russian  
partisan network in Ukraine, stating that even if cars of enlistment officers are burnt down  
this doesn't mean they are pro-Russian, but against drafting. All other is Russian activity is secret service, but not pro-Russian partisans.  
You had asked about optimism and I only can give you gloom.",r/ukrainianconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRnFqaHZFaGxwVVd3aGk2WFZEaDl0R0l6dFY0MkNBZ1RQVmtQTXdJcXRycFdHbTh4cllTWmlodHVMblpTTHJwczlyRUlOUjhpQ216d1huWk1HcHlMclE9PQ==

"I am literally so thankful is white versus white because has it been different and Russia be non white they LITERALLY WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED THE PROPER CRITICISM THAT IS OWED.  They would absolutely get treated as the good guys and or ctictism be equating to racism and be even more resistant ant than pro Russians already are to taking accountability and ability to hear criticism or anger for Russians and what they are doing.

But these people still managed to worm racism in anyway and are like CARING AT ALL shows rascist bc muh whAtAboUT and acting like ""why when we didn't have this level of social media or maybe we're just kids or maybe an infant werent caring about muh whAtAboUTs?!     

Acting like the fact that they didn't see this reaction is something other than ........ a difference in the timed and technology and what is capable happens to be so unique here that ITS NEW FOR ALL OF US.   Meaning this is the level going forward that will be possible if a conflict has the same capacity.  It involved starlink, security cams, go pros, cell cameras, drone footage, satellite footage AND the ability to upload it AND have the platforms we do now that are also interconnected like we weren't years ago.     What it also means is that now war crimes have actual proof for that didnt in the past, how easy it is to see lies fall apart that got people to invade and hear the world shooting at them, and it's while to now be able to see what your own do and watch them be absolute barbarians systematically and be OK with that and not angered and disgusted but instead completely unbothered like this in normal for them. 

All of this stuff and more are factors and ALL OF IT gets ignored and people have the nerve to be like ""I don't get it why this is happening"".  It's not like if we  in tHe wEsT backed off, that they would take our place.  They don't want to support and come for the ones who do.  So in the end, they'd like a victim to get no support and have no one in their court.  Nice.

That all said it's not just the global south but the west that do this also.  Aa a Greek American wirh familfy in Greece i am so disappointed finding out they are heavily under pro Russian mindset.  My own family didn't understand why I cared and my aunt was like ""oh sweetie you've lost your way"".

 üò£

And to see the UN meetings and never see a Greek be one of the representatives.  Albania thought they are a solid one i didnt expect ... no particular reason other than I don't know much about them and to hear them be vocal and a solid consistent voice at the UN...good on them üëè.  And I'm glad to know they aren't victim to Russian propaganda.  As a small country and all the places Russia got its pawns on, they did something right.  Too bad Greece can't get some of that.  My dad also doesn't care (he's Greek who moved to the US at 18. Anyway so far no luck on my family and see literally a massive absence online from Greeks. I know they know English and i am really disappointed to see only a handful of times a Greek defended Ukraine.

(and i was also disgusted to see them then do the exact thing you'd expect - be the kind that now support the thing thst aligns with the anti west narritive.  Also really upset my DAD even reacted this way and found out he hates the Jews and blamed them for shit they apparently did in his work years ago.  I had ZERO IDEA HE HATED JEWS.  We literally lived amonst many Jews when I grew up and one was my best friend (very brown by the way so gotta love all this racism talk lol around).  I really wish people stopped thinking people use skin color to decicde shit and maybe lisiten to what people say and there be loads infirmation they'd get to understand someone.  It's almost like they project and now that THATS what they do.    We are ware after seeing who does and doesn't support Ukraine and his support for ""white people"" the one and only time they needed to and it was just to difficult to do.....

We understand the world much better know seeing their views have to be challenged the one time here and it was their choice to show how their credibility would be harmed or helped and want with not caring or actively have been intentionally harmful towards Ukraine or pro Russia.  Great job showing all the stuff we heard peoole say and about literally not matter.  YEARS of defending stuff long over and have all the energy in the world for centuries old shit but current victims? Naawww we don't have time for that now we are busy or don't need to care about.  Wild how if you claim to be suffering from of colonialism or rape of resources or a coup etc ..... and have made it clear this all is why you hate the west ..... and supposedly blame it for all your grief, you should be the FIRST ONES TO SYMPATHIZE WHEN YOU SEE IT HAPPEN TO SOMEONE ELSE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE GOING THROUGH, UNDERSTAND WHY RUSSIA IS WRONG, AND NOT WANT THE LASTING IMPACTS TO HAPPEN TO THEM EITHER.  

I just all around find this all just crap.  It's not hard here to either say the right thing and if they can't they had the option of silence. At least I can say this is what I noticed for Greeks. Thry got that part right and are just silent.   That's what the other peoole elsewhere shoukd be capable of and it's that seems incredibly difficult and most snd up being pro Russian blatantly and zero shame nor fucks that that's the worst thing to do for your reputation.   And then see 2 years in those same people whip out halos.  Like LOL the extreme virture signaling was so cringe since we knew now they don't use morals right versus wrong and don't realize what they look like and even call shit hypocrisy üíÄ.  Zero self awareness and thinking shit hasn't changed and they can't do their good old usual moral outdate that's dominated the main narrtive.  They used to get to say that word and and we gave them the bandit of the doubt and just let them go off.  2022 and since changed things.

"The problem of most nations is that a lot 8f them are not true nations. They are construct of colonisation, that is from colonial borders. For example the kurds is the biggest ethnicity without a nation. Just because some stupid brits and French decided of this. The result is decades of fighting etc. Same for Africa where boundaries are along the colonial rule that would cut through different tribes land and people etc. 

People of the west just doesn't understand this because western countries are mostly hundreds years old compare to most of the global south which are only half a century old. Some who think this is simple, that it is just some barbarians that just can't get along. just have to look at what happened in Europe from Northern Ireland, the catalan or Belgium.

"Perhaps now is the time to decide - we're learning that scale and subsidization benefits NATO countries and those that NATO supports; it's the reason the partnership exists and on a macroeconomic scale, the benefits are hard to deny. Also, when given the option, many nations would choose not to exceed their own domestic defense needs. It is short sighted, unfortunately, but we see evidence in the US that some politicians have an uphill battle funding foreign wars that don't immediately threaten the safety of the citizenry. In the end, it took six months and cost the US House leader his position to pass the latest round of funding.

Countries are generally resistant to give ""too much away"" as you suggest. And many countries would prefer to give nothing away that would tradeoff from their own national defense resources.

The contributions of the NATO group flatly outperform scenarios where every country develops their own equipment. There's simply more to go around - and non-member states are benefiting.

Moreover, there have been zero instances where any member nation or non-member beneficiary nation is rejecting military support based solely on the country of manufacture. And there are zero instances where individual nations are seeing greater returns on a hypothetical 2% GDP investment by ""bootstrapping it"" on their own, with the use of partially mothballed factories. Is there any evidence you have to the contrary?

Simply put - Without NATO, there's less to go around. Efficiencies abound. Standardization and centralization increase the value of each dollar spent by every member country. It's worth a watch of Perun's videos on YouTube for more background, and he explains why Baltic NATO nations are incentivzed to contribute disproportionately.

Incidentally, you may have noticed... non-member nations have been beneficiaries of the partnership.",r/ukrainianconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZSHZGYjZQZlBvNWtldUNuWUJWNXRXeUlvel92cE1QaHJhb0VyTzdYdWZtdGg1QnJoc1hVUk1hd2dmd1NaNmNVNXY3MGl2bG04UHdyT1Mtc21Dc1BzYmc9PQ==

What I got from it is what was in the headline (western uncertainty is causing issues). Removing the bit about NATO, there's a lot the West is getting wrong, and it is providing the wrong effect (emboldening Russia). 

With the way things are going, maybe we'll get to the point where Putin thinks ""nothing will happen if I use a tactical nuke"" and does so and is proven right. Then, the strategy of appeasement to prevent WW3 will be exposed for what it is: extreme caution to the point of cowardice.

">Given your advocacy of libertarian self-sufficiency, I‚Äôd guess that you‚Äôre advocating for India giving back the $65B in economic aid you received from the US? India top recipient of US economic aid.

The aid doesn‚Äôt go into the Indian government budget. It goes to NGOs operating in India. Quite a few of them would actually be American NGOs. The U.S. is free to recoup the money from these NGOs if they want to and if they still want it.

Good advice. Why did the West not cooperate with India during Cold War instead of arming Pakistan who was waging wars against us?

States in Global South by and large does sympathize with Ukraine. It is not that hard to figure. In each UN vote, only very few sided with Russia. Most voted Against Russian agression and some have abstained. The author of the article talking about a particular group of people within Global South and their perception, and portraying them as representative of whole.

I am from Bangladesh, while I can't talk for other countries in Global South, however, I certainly know mine.

Any loss of innocent life a tragedy, and everyone should sympathize with the vicitm. Russia is the clear agressior here, and I do sympathize with the innocent people in Ukraine. But that does not change geopolitical and economic realities on the international stage. Like it or not, Russia has the world largest land mass and most natural resources. It is not realistic for developing world to cut ties with Russia over this war. 

I mean, what Israel is doing is equally horrible. War crimes and injustice are being exposed by West's own institutions and entities. Europe and US could've said, yes Hamas is bad but we wouldn't let you indiscriminately bomb Gaza just to kill Hamas either. Or if this is too complicated for some, then I can point to the illegal land grabs that Israel has been doing. That is active colonization by any definition. Just as horrible as what Russia is trying to do in Ukraine. And guess what? Everytime such land grab happens, West and Europe condemns it. Because they know it's wrong. But do they cut ties with Israel over this? No. For them, it is not a realistic option. The same is true w.r.t Russia over its agression in Ukriane.

"I believe this statement has many generalizations which is typical of a short sighted view of the world. We tend to try to put large chunks of people in boxes an labels them. There's no ""global south"" as an entity that can be described. Each country or region had its own dynamics and reasons to take or not a side.

In the case of Brazil (my home country) it's largely a stake at being neutral, economic interests and political view of the current party in power. China is the #1 trade partner. Russia is still an important source of fertilizers for agriculture. BTW, agriculture that feeds a good part of the world. 

We are sympathetic with Ukraine and hope that the ginny will be put back into the bottle and Russia will fall back. However that does not mean automatic alignment to US policies. It's not pretty, but it's pragmatic.

BTW, not more pragmatic than when the US deals with autocratic governments like Saudi Arabia, ignoring a lot for the sake of oil.

"I don't think this has to be revoked. Seeking asylum is human right, but it does not make them above the law.

Countries have their procedures for processing asylum seekers, they are often required to enter through designated points, formally seek asylum, and follow instructions during their review. If denied, which it is likely to be under these circumstances, they will be deported. If they travelled safely through Russia and Belarus, then it may be considered a safe path back, and will be asked or forced to leave the country back over the border. Otherwise it would be necessary to arrange safe passage.

Asylum seekers who are legitimately fleeing war, persecution or famine should be admitted accordingly under certain conditions and with appropriate preparation

More will likely need to be done to manage incoming asylum seekers humanely, manpower will be needed to process them quickly, and in the worst case, work will need to be done to arrange passage back, but I think there would be a case for sending them back to Belarus, with transit documents to present to Belarusian officials. We will, of course, attempt to cooperate with Belarusian authorities on this, if they are willing.

This would be costly, but with cooperation, a pretty small expense for humanity. Also consider how utterly wasteful and inhuman these actions are from Russia and Belarus, countries that are already facing a massive demographic crisis that makes the Western demographic crisis look like nothing. 

In the medium and long term, and done with care and cooperation, being able to admit asylum seekers and some migrants at scale would be a boon to Western economies, and an incredible waste by Russia who doesn't even care about its own young men, let alone anyone outside Moscow.

If migrants do not follow the instructions of border guards, either initially, during the review process, or after denial of entry, then they should be treated with the same amount of force anybody attempting to storm a border should. 

I think we need to spend some money on dealing with this humanely, initial investment, but we can afford it, though may be politically unpopular. But then we blunt the effectiveness of these tactics, while potentially befitting long-term. This is a simplistic and somewhat optimistic view, but I don't think we need to compromise our principles to manage and defend our borders.",r/ukrainianconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaSUx1djhvSFAxcUxqNUE1Vi1SVFE1VnltNG9OWlVmbDU0N043U0V6bTZYeGo1Tnp4UkNxRUlvWHNRNXJZc3hXQWVkd29xdGgtZVBad3gxc081REhGS1E9PQ==

"This is a good point, actually.

Since the US and European countries don't sell this Ukraine war to their populations the way Russia does (the West is a threat!), it's harder to position their aid to Ukraine as being beneficial to the general public (for example).

And let's be honest, crushing Russia won't just be beneficial to these countries' citizens, but the fucking *world* moving forward.

Still, this type of illegal and destabilising actions do affect their citizens. I mean, someone lost their life because of it.

>Sullivan clearly has profound worries about how this will all play out. Months into the counter-offensive, Ukraine has yet to reclaim much more of its territory; the Administration has been telling members of Congress that the conflict could last three to five years. A grinding war of attrition would be a disaster for both Ukraine and its allies, but a negotiated settlement does not seem possible as long as Putin remains in power. Putin, of course, has every incentive to keep fighting through next year‚Äôs U.S. election, with its possibility of a Trump return. And it‚Äôs hard to imagine Zelensky going for a deal with Putin, either, given all that Ukraine has sacrificed. ***Even a Ukrainian victory would present challenges for American foreign policy, since it would ‚Äúthreaten the integrity of the Russian state and the Russian regime and create instability throughout Eurasia,‚Äù as one of the former U.S. officials put it to me. Ukraine‚Äôs desire to take back occupied Crimea has been a particular concern for Sullivan,*** who has privately noted the Administration‚Äôs assessment that this scenario carries the highest risk of Putin following through on his nuclear threats. In other words, there are few good options.

>‚ÄúThe reason they‚Äôve been so hesitant about escalation is not exactly because they see Russian reprisal as a likely problem,‚Äù the former official said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like they think, Oh, we‚Äôre going to give them atacms and then Russia is going to launch an attack against nato.

"> It's pretty shitty to condemn Biden for his ""as long as it takes"" comment as no one could have foreseen how successful Trump would be in turning Republicans in Congress against Ukraine.

But, at the same time, restrictions started even before Republicans came to power.

They're not a ""only if we could do it, but we can't!"" thing. They are part of policy ***since the very beginning***.

Hell:

>[Biden thought the secretaries had gone too far, according to multiple administration officials familiar with the call. On the previously unreported conference call, as Austin flew to Germany and Blinken to Washington, the president expressed concern that the comments could set unrealistic expectations and increase the risk of the U.S. getting into a direct conflict with Russia. He told them to tone it down, said the officials. ‚ÄúBiden was not happy when Blinken and Austin talked about winning in Ukraine,‚Äù one of them said. ‚ÄúHe was not happy with the rhetoric.‚Äù](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/secretaries-defense-state-said-publicly-us-wanted-ukraine-win-biden-sa-rcna33826)

Assault Breacher Vehicles were supplied only ***AFTER*** official end of counteroffensive:

>[A senior Ukrainian official, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military matters, said Kyiv received ***less than 15 percent*** of the quantity of demining and engineering materiel, including MICLICs, that it asked for from Western partners ahead of the counteroffensive.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/07/15/ukraine-war-russia-mines-counteroffensive/)

[And from about the same time around](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraines-lack-of-weaponry-and-training-risks-stalemate-in-fight-with-russia-f51ecf9):

>BRUSSELS‚ÄîWhen Ukraine launched its big counteroffensive this spring, Western military officials knew Kyiv didn‚Äôt have all the training or weapons‚Äîfrom shells to warplanes‚Äîthat it needed to dislodge Russian forces. But they hoped Ukrainian courage and resourcefulness would carry the day.

[And about ATACMS](https://eng.obozrevatel.com/section-war/news-he-was-afraid-of-russias-reaction-but-changed-his-position-biden-decides-on-atacms-for-ukraine-in-september-new-yorker-10-10-2023.html)

>Previously, Biden rejected the idea of such supplies, fearing that the introduction of American missiles into the Ukrainian army, which could destroy targets not only in all the occupied territories of Ukraine but also in Russia and Belarus, could lead to the outbreak of World War III. Biden's fears and the decisions he made to overcome them are described in an article by The New Yorker.

>The publication notes that throughout the year, Biden categorically refused to make a decision on the transfer of long-range ATACMS missiles to Ukraine because he was afraid of the Kremlin's reaction: according to the American president, such a step by the United States ""would mean an unacceptable escalation for Putin,"" as these missiles are capable of reaching not only all the territories of Ukraine occupied by Russia, but also targets in Russia or Belarus.

So, as you could see, whenever there was a window of opportunity, it got ignored for ""non-escalation"".

Not to mention considering Ukraine being able to win as ""unrealistic expectations"" and also as outright dangerous to US foreign policy.

Oh, and the Lend-Lease 2022 thing? Not a single bolt supplied through it before it was allowed to expire, despite each and every opportunity.

>But you're not a very honest person, as with your claim that Serbia has no restrictions on the weapons it has sent...is Serbia sending long range weapons? No. So it's a moot point. And Serbia is not even sending them directly, but through a third party as not to upset Russia.

1. Serbia sells extended-range Grad munitions, so there's that.

2. So what? No restrictions sale is no restrictions sale. Those're the best Ukraine gets anyway, as even [UK keeps flip-flopping on Storm Shadow usage](https://lb.ua/society/2024/07/12/623802_telegraph_minoboroni_britanii.html).

>But Serbia is okay in your eyes. It's the US you save your ire for.

Serbia didn't run many rounds of disarmament on Ukraine, for one, claiming that being for safety of Ukrainian people. Or do you not remember the ‚ÄúWe need to eliminate these stockpiles for the safety of the Ukrainian people and people around world, by keeping them out of conflicts around the world.‚Äù?

>It looks like Trump will be elected again to the US presidency. He'll immediately kick off a debate about whether the US should cut off all aid to Ukraine. As part of his argument, he'll claim that all Ukrainians do is ask for more, more, more...

Sure, it's a possibility.

In other case, dripfeed just barely enough to avoid complete collapse for ""as long as it takes"" in order to keep up the ""close fight"" (i.e. meatgrinder) is a complete certainty.

And there's also a possibility of [going loan on it, instead of grant](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4591221-trump-ukraine-aid-were-thinking-about-making-it-in-the-form-of-a-loan/). If it exceeds current dripfeed rates in *either* demand available for loan *or* less throttling usage restrictions, it'll *already* be an upgrade for Ukraine. Better to be indebted and armed enough to be alive, than debtless and dead because the dripfeed policy sayeth meatgrinder must go on ane russia mustn't be losing too much.

We're reaching the point when it might be better to roll the dice, rather than go on with predictable ""non-escalation"" that will only grant us slow collapse into a depopulated rump state with no infrastructure surviving and title of ""[Paraguay of the 21st century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguayan_War#Casualties_of_the_war)"". [And, apparently, Duda might also be up to something to weigh that dice towards greater support of Ukraine](https://www.politico.eu/article/polands-president-duda-plays-whisperer-to-turn-donald-trump-against-russia/).

A more concrete thing is the pattern of US spies starting to die in large numbers during his term. With quick sourcing I found a few relevant pieces. And a lot of materials would not even lead to visible, immediate consequences when leaked, so it is impossible to know the full scope what he sold.

"We shouldn't forget that many of their older planes are scrap metal.

Roughly half of Russia's Airforce wasn't ready for deployment before the war.

Russia's airspace is huge. They need them to protect their airspace, and to bomb Syria, etc.

https://meta-defense.fr/en/2024/02/04/russian_air_forces_2023_fighters/

https://twitter.com/SamRamani2/status/1565491571000328199?s=20&t=Nnbbu-WOUFfOuOH-HSedZQ

Russia lost 67 pilots were lost by September 2022.

Now, this number is now over 200. 

Russia lost more than one-fourth of its pre-war fighter jet stocks and around 1/3 of its helicopters. 

Adjusted by PPP, Russia spends roughly half the money the US Air Force spends on the training of these pilots. Not adjusted by PPP, the difference is even more pronounced.

Modern Russian aircraft are designed for a 3,500 and 4,500 flight hour service life, and some for as many as 6,000. 

The Soviet-era platforms were designed for 2,000 to 3,500 hours. Some models,¬†such as the MiG-31, have been upgraded to extend service life, but most of the older models are nearing the end of their service lives, with only 500 to 1,000 hours remaining.

Especially many of the older aircraft such as MIG 29, Su24, and Su25 are often not combat ready any longer. 

Modern US-F15 airframes have a service life of 20.000 hours, and other upgraded models are up to 10.000 hours.

https://breakingdefense.com/2023/10/russias-air-force-eating-into-aircraft-lifespans-with-no-easy-solution/

Russia had extended the life span of their Mig 31 airframes from 2000 to 3500 flight hours in 2021. 

https://bulgarianmilitary.com/2020/09/12/russia-will-extend-the-service-life-of-mig-31-supersonic-interceptor-aircraft/

Most of these older airframes are a nice waste of scrap metal. Putin can't change the laws of physics by decree.

Russia is a very poor development nation which has spent most of its existence since late 1991 in a war or preparing for one. 

Russia is among the most corrupt countries in the entire world. It may not come as a surprise if part of the money wasn't invested into the VKS but went into the pockets of oligarchs.

Sandbox or Perun can give further insights into other areas such as training, logistics, etc.

"A good example is the conflict between Putin and Khodorkovsky (which many people feel was a turning point in Putin's career).

>In 2003, masked agents stormed Khodorkovsky's private jet during a refueling stop and arrested him at gunpoint. Authorities charged him with fraud and tax evasion. They imprisoned him in Siberia, where he would languish for the next decade. The government took over his oil empire and handed the keys to one of Putin's longtime associates, Igor Sechin.

The West doesn‚Äôt care if Ukraine ‚Äúwins‚Äù. The West is treating this like the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Make it last as long as possible to bleed out Russia. 

For the west this war is a win-win.  Bleed out one of your top enemies without using any of your own troops while simultaneously using your weapon systems to judge how they do in combat against said enemy. 

The west doesn‚Äôt benefit from Ukraine winning (nor does it benefit from Russia winning) but the west absolutely benefits from this being a years long stalemate. 

This is why I argue that Ukraine needs to settle for peace asap. The support from the west will eventually wane, and likely wane quickly, since there‚Äôs no clear path to victory for Ukraine.  As the support from the west dries up, Russia, who is making very small but incremental gains in untrained, will be able to hasten their gains to the breaking point do Ukraine and ultimately emerge dominant.

">If hypocrisy had a face it would look just like you. 

I am no hypocrite. 

>India is not asking Russia to kill Ukrainians. 

No just providing them with the funds to do so. If you paid someone and allowed them to kill another with those funds are you held accountable for that in a court of law. I would think so.  

>Also India isn't the only country buying Russian oil. 

Very true, they have just accelerated it at a record pace, in order to support the Russia economy during this time of war. China is also quite culpable. 

>Europe buys much more than India does. 

They do not. What numbers do you have for Europe, consisting of many countries with many different policies versus India.

>Why don't you speak there? 

You should back up your statements with facts. 

>And why didn't Ukraine maintain its military of the strength to atleast safeguard itself? 

Russia appeasement and it is a smaller country than Russia, and gave up much of it weapons, including nuclear weapons during a negotiation with Russia. They maintained their neutrality, until Russia showed interest in invasion. Then they started to build up as quickly as they could, but these things take time and money and support from other countries, which they eventually got. 

>Your decisions have costed you this not India's. 

They are not my decisions. India and China decision to fund a war machine is killing people. Many people and they just brush it off as ""That's business""

>Also I still stand by my statement of Ukraine supplying arms to Pakistan against India. Killing of ppl is the same anywhere in the world. All lives are equal.

Okay, Russia supplied weapons to Pakistan as well. The RPD for instance, or the PKM, SPG-9, RPG-7, Kornet-E, MI-17, MI-24, So do you still support Russia's invasion of Ukraine, now that you know that Russia has supplied weapon to Pakistan.  I guess hyprcrisy only goes so far. And what weapons systems are actually supplied by Ukraine to Pakistan. I saw T-80s. What else has there been. In addition, Ukraine seems to have sold arms to both India and Pakistan and more to India, so perhaps you should be thanking them for India's ability to protect themselves. 

>Let me remind you that we don't supply weapons like Ukraine we are trading just like Europe is doing. 

Not quite true, India Oil import accelerated rapidly when Russia needed the money to finance their war. It is not business as usual, because if it was no one would have said anything. Of course there were still countries that funded the Nazi's during the early part of the war, so why would India be any different than those countries. 

>On the other hand Ukraine supplies weapons to a Terrorist state. I hope you can see who's a bigger criminal.

Um, no. Perhaps some, but the largest suppliers to terrorist states are Russia, China and the US. So I would not punish a people such the Ukrainians when they are trying to defend themselves. I understand you hatred for Pakistanis, but you should not be so selective with the countries that you think deserve punishment. 

>Also, India being strong does not in any way justify Ukraine supplying weapons to a Terrorist state. Think about it.

So is Russia, so is China, so is the US. 

Furthermore Russia is tricking Indians into defense contracts in the Ukraine war. Do you support that?  Russia is the largest terrorist organization there is, and is currently attacking civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, at a large scale, and India, among others is giving them the money to do so.

"Yeah, yeah :D

There will be 1.5 million cripples due to the Ukraine war in Russia. Plus, the Russian state is an impoverished development country, and I hope he assumes that Russia takes roughly half a million casualties every 1.5 years in Ukraine and loses 5 times the tanks it can reproduce.

The sinews of wars are infinite money. And what this guy assumes is pure nonsense because he fails to understand that this war is not over and that Russia will lose more men than ever before in the months to come. 

Also, you know, the Russian birthrate collapsed in the mid 90s, therfore in the next 10 years or so, the smallest Russian generation ever is available for the draft. 1.5 to 2 million Russians have fled, the prisons are emptied, and the far Eastern regions will also need some labor force, so those 1.5 million soldiers, they will need officers, which are dying like flies they will need gear, they will need training facilties and training, they will need food, shelter, etc. 

The guy seems to fail to understand that the war is ongoing and that the Russians will lose many more men, for which there is no replacement generation.

Also, the times of Russian fossil fuel business are coming to an end. And did he consider the amount of damage Ukraine will cause to the Russian infrastructure, or how the sanctions will affect Russia in the years to come.

Or how will Russia replace its lost tanks without their Soviet stockpile? Or how will Russia finance a war with NATO? 

How will Russia defeat the Western Navy and Airforce? Where will Russia take the artillery pieces from? 

This assessment is really stupid due to the fact that no one can know what will be the case in 2029, because the elephant in the room is Russian losses in Ukraine, right now Russia replenishes nothing they just take more losses.

Ukraine will bind manpower and equipment no matter what happens.

Therefore, as of right now, Russia takes something like 35k casualties a month. And they can put 30k or so troops into the field each month.

Let's say, in mid-2025, the war ends.

And then, until 2029, Russia would have to find 300k men for 5 years straight and hire them as soldiers. And then what? 1.5 million men, they need gear, they need logistics, etc. Russia already has a 5 million people worker shortage, and their demographics are collapsing. 

Removing another 1.5 million is a great idea. 

I think in total, Peter Zeihan calculates with 8 million Russians aged 35 or under prior to the war. The Russians should consider revolt, or they will have to bring 8 million body bags.

Their pathetic colonial war has gone far enough already. It is really high time that our politicians ensure the problem of Russian imperialism is dealt with.

"Because this isn't a prediction, it is taking data and analyzing it, and then extrapolating it. But this guy bases his analysis on things such as Russia will have 1.5 million soldiers in 5 to 8 years. OK and how will he know that? He cannot know how many men Russia has lost and will still lose in Ukraine. I say even another 1 million casualties on the Russian side is possible should the war stretch into 2026. He also cannot know how many tanks etc. Russia will still lose, and how many more refineries will be hit etc. So his analysis is far too limited and mono causal, he needs to be more complex and wider and try to asses many angles from history to politics to economics and so and so forth, he also has to take chaos factors into account and that the attrition will drastically increase the more weapons Ukraine gets, he also needs to factor in that by 2029 the Russian oil and gas sector will have massively shrunk in size and the Russian access to capital and skilled labor will shrink as well. I doubt he took that all into account. And there is more to take into account than that of course. And if you want to look 6 years into the future and make such very detailed claims then better do your homework. 

That is not what that other NATO guy is doing because he wants to predict human behavior and that is impossible, I have economic, demographic and military data, combined with the state of the Russian military, their training, their logistics etc. and that makes the assessment different from claiming nonsense.

I can for example very well forecast that the decline of Russian demographics is going to continue and will accelerate, or that the Russian budget is unlikely to majorly recover, or that their economic model is faltering, or that a Russian attack on NATO is unliky due to the amount of attrition Russia took and their production rates just do not support it.

"KYIV ‚Äî Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on his military to give him a detailed plan before approving a demand to conscript as many as 500,000 soldiers to join the country's war effort.

‚ÄúThe mobilization of an additional 450,000 to 500,000 people will cost Ukraine 500 billion hryvnia [‚Ç¨12 billion] and I would like to know where the money will come from,‚Äù Zelenskyy said during a Tuesday press conference in Kyiv. ‚ÄúConsidering that it takes six Ukrainian working civilians paying taxes to pay the salary of one soldier, I would need to get 3 million more working people somewhere to be able to pay for the additional troops.‚Äù

Ukraine is under pressure to increase its forces to deal with its bloody war of attrition with Russia, and also to allow exhausted front-line troops to rotate away from the fighting to rest and recuperate.

Zelenskyy said he wants to see a war plan and a project to demobilize those soldiers who have been fighting the Russians for almost two years. Those demands are one of the causes of Zelenskyy‚Äôs ongoing rift with Ukraine‚Äôs top military commander, Valeriy Zaluzhny.

‚ÄúAs of now, I did not see demobilization in their plan. And that is a No. 1 question, an issue of justice for those fighting at the war front for so long,‚Äù Zelenskyy said.

Ukrainian lawmakers and the military are currently working on changes to the existing mobilization bill that includes reducing the conscription age from 27 to 25 and possibly starting to conscript women. Currently, more than 40,000 women serve in the military as volunteers.

However, that's a line Zelenskyy won't cross.

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt sign the mandatory mobilization for women. But the decreasing of conscription age ‚Äî that I will sign,‚Äù the president said.

Zelenskyy said it was ""very serious"" to consider drafting half a million additional people, and added he needed more arguments because ""this is a question of people, justice, defense capability, and finances.""

Calling him a moderate is a stretch cause or implies he has enough of awerness of either side to have a moderate approach. Heck it implies that he has enough awerness to understand the problem to balance between two radicals. Like... He thinks NATO is some kind of subscription club ran by US. He has no idea what a nuclear triad is. He thinks a shark will eat you when you are on an electric boat. You get the gist, he has no idea what he is talking about.

"I think you are looking at it too sober. You could have made a similar argument in 2013 and 2020, and yet here we are.

Thing is, Russia is maintaining a stream of recruits into their army and is able to be a force despite heavy losses. Even further, they do have enough support (India, China, and Iran) to shoulder a lot of the impact of sanctions. These sanctions are helpful, but aren't enough. Russian economy is going into a capsule mode where a lot of commodities are disappearing and are sacrificed for war effort. And the industry is gearing up for a long haul.

This is where problems arise. In late stages of WWII, when soviets pierced through eastern lines and allies landed in Normandy, Hitler thought that if German people can't defend the fatherland, they don't deserve it. So soldiers and civilians were sent to crumbling frontlines under duress or straight under a death threat. Why am I mentioning it? Cause Russian propaganda is already preparing Russian population to similar ideas. They are already talking ""why would should exist if Russia wouldn't?"". Pundits are already saying that this war is an existential struggle, cause somehow, if they don't win against Ukraine, their country will cease to exist. Stupid, right? On top of that, in a year, two, or three, the industry will be near 100% for war effort. Switching gears will be the same as just stoping the whole country's economy. This might be perceived as an existential threat and the old people holding power in Russia could decide to ignite another conflict to fuel the economy or stabilize internal distress. So it might be that in 4 or so year they will do something stupid and NATO, or maybe just Europe, will be unified enough in their perceived threat of Russian occupation that they will respond. And the response prolly will be a low intensity action, which will prompt Russian to respond and so on and by December of 2029 we have a Frontline from Murmansk to Minsk.

Putin‚Äôs fear of making an unpopular choice of mobilization and the army‚Äôs overconfident projections lead to there be way too few Russian troops in Ukraine to complete the job they were assigned.

The Russian army in Ukraine is now in a much much better position than they were 2 years ago.

"From one of the articles you linked: 

""So, is the war good for the Russian economy? An analogy by the 19th-century French economist, Frederic Bastiat, helps to explain why it‚Äôs not. Bastiat described a boy who has broken a window. The boy‚Äôs father pays a glazer to replace it, spending the money on goods and services, and thus provides a boost to the economy. But the assumption that breaking windows is good for economic growth is a fallacy, Bastiat explains. By spending the money on reglazing the window, the boy‚Äôs father can‚Äôt spend it on other goods and services for himself. Neither, more importantly, can he spend it on investing in productivity. The overall effect is negative, albeit possibly a delayed one.

In Russia, the broken windows are the army‚Äôs tanks and missiles. Producing them round the clock isn‚Äôt increasing productivity. The high demand for workers and difficulties accessing Western technology mean Russia actually saw a record 3.6 per cent fall in labour productivity in 2022 (second only this century to the 4.1 per cent fall recorded in 2009 amid the global economic crisis). A slight rebound in 2023 failed to bring productivity levels back to pre-war levels.""

I honestly question if the US actually wants Ukraine to win. I think they want them to not lose but really do not want to see them outright win.

"USTAINABLE OPERATIONS? NOT EVEN CLOSE FOR RUSSIA According to British intelligence and open source information, Russia has over the course of the past 12 months , produced just under 750 BMP-3 (IFV), while having lost around 780 of them over the same time frame. However the BMP-1, 2 and MT-LB are now largely exhausted and completely irreplaceable. So allowing for the rough 1 loss to 1 new vehicle - which is quite an impressive rate, is still nowhere near enough to make up for stockpiled and now exhausted supplies of every other type. Clearly they simply don‚Äôt have the production to meet the requirements the army has - in fact they cannot possibly reach the numbers required to make any inroads into the losses overall. Then you have the artillery problem. Yesterday alone Ukraine took out 62 Russian artillery pieces. Many of these were D-30 sixty + year old systems of towed artillery that have either been dragged out of stores and refurbished or supplied by N.Korea. These are lower calibre, shorter ranged towed and manned pieces that are far from cutting edge. It‚Äôs a 122mm piece that first entered service in 1960 and was designed around 1957. This is now Russia‚Äôs main artillery because the Ukrainians have reduced the modern SPG and heavy artillery to such low levels by concentrating so heavily on Russian artillery for over a year now. In terms of air defence systems Russia has now been observed to have removed all of the equipment in 11 of 17 of its recognised strategic air defence sites around the country, to get them to the front. Replacing these systems is virtually impossible. And if that wasn‚Äôt sufficient, the British intelligence estimate based on satellites and official and open source information- shows Russia lost 70,000 men just in May-June. That‚Äôs simply staggering in modern war and approaching WW1 levels of death rates. Again, Russia is not sustaining this war with what it needs to win it, its domestic production simply isn‚Äôt able to meet demand so every day the Ukrainians attrition war against Russia slowly you would think, pays off. And it does in that Russia kills far fewer Ukrainians than it loses of its own badly resourced and trained soldiers. Yet that cannot be said of land regained. Like it or not Ukraine is still, over all, losing more ground than it retakes and the Russians still keep advancing bit by tiny bit in various spots along the front. This has to be stopped. And it needs to be reversed. Because until it is, peace can never be achieved on terms Ukraine can live with. Somewhere along the line Russia‚Äôs unsustainable war must cost it dearly - and right now that‚Äôs just not happening. ‚ÄòThe Analyst‚Äô MilStratOnX",r/ukrainianconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnZTIzWUZLbzhWRTRzb3JTT19UR3NiMm9wRGNCNWNsNzVnaGRuMlBqR0MweVpTWks3RFZ0WGFVUmg4SnFjYU43cU92TDdjc2xtcTBlQUdBMjVFcjlVQWc9PQ==

It's acting like a terrorist, messing with GPS signals and moving border buoys and a dozen other things, precisely because it does not have the capacity to wage war with NATO.¬†",r/ukrainianconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnaXhTaHpYZkNlOXZXbXhDV3VyckIzQlVFaUc1TGxtdmdRbmotSVpTMVBORlBOcFZZQm5xQndERlh4eDhoclRoRnhVU2lYSTBKalpqTGkxcDBpXzBxN2c9PQ==

"I think we should prepare as if this were the case, but I just can‚Äôt see it. Russia has been in a stalemate with Ukraine for more than 2 years. And Ukraine has a fraction of the military and are using old donated NATO equipment and Soviet leftovers. Their Black Sea fleet has been getting chewed up by a country with no real navy!

I know the Russians are stupid, but it‚Äôs hard to imagine anyone in authority that projects the last two years into a successful hot war with the US, let alone the rest of NATO.¬†",r/ukrainianconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnNWVzaFZ6OWFOcmgtdzV6QmYwUVhhTFk2SGRudms3VzBreWVPY1o4UXZTSlkxRDdCT2RTcHdwTjFWVVZDM1RfV3VoN0hZcUFDYjFTVS1GQlA3Rjc0SnlKdl8zQ25CWVplR24tMzhnYUh6MHc9

"There's US Bases and NATO allies in the region dude. What war are you watching?

I find that hard to believe because they can't even decimate Ukrainian forces. They can only decimate a children's hospital.
