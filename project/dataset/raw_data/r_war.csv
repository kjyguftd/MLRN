"Move out the way? Eh probably not enough time by time communication gets to you.

"In most cases, you'll have less than a minute after the round is fired and at most, you'll have a minute or two, three.

So even if you had an early detection system that was able to calculate the target coordinates in seconds, you wouldn't have a lot of time to 

1) Realize what's going on  
2) Inform and organise your men  
3) Make a run for it",r/war,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNRMWJLbk44WFZjd3NiTmZZTm1BVHFuWmVtWEx3S3kzYVVTaF91NkpHZzhLSm5BdmZzdHVjeG1uTzA4SGM5ZVVic2pVaVFCLW1IMTltMWJ5NU1QSkh3d2c9PQ==
"Sound travels 343m/s while an artillery shells muzzle velocity is between 910-1070m/s, the shell travels in an arc however, and it loses some speed during flight due to air resistance, so the sound of it being fired reaches you first. We're talking around 20-30 seconds of flight time, maybe 40 if it's at maximum charge.  
This gives you roughly 1-2 seconds from hearing the gun go boom until the shell impacts.  
Having an early warning system that fits inside that time scale isn't feasible, it's also impossible to know the trajectory and range before the shell is fired (as the recipient).

Experienced veterans learn to tell if the gun is aimed at you or not (the sound is different from a gun that's not) and can get into cover during that second or two.  
That's it.",r/war,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNROG83MGJybG1FVDFDX2dFdXlTdTFMQXB4bTQyZ1FuNFNhVWxXNFEyR1dTRGthT3EyWHF3Z2dwdlo1czZ0NnQ0eFFVUnRyMjh6Nm5iM3k1TFF2cGpBZGc9PQ==
If initial detection/ordinance tracking were that accurate it would be used for immediate counter-battery fire. Shells aren't like missiles. It would be one thing to detect enemy fire in general but predicting the path of ordinance after its' fired but before it hits?

"With really good tech, that seems possible.  You would need an automated system to send alerts, though, because a human operator would not be able to calculate that.  

That would require an interconnected system of smart devices that was live tracking every soldier's live position.  While certainly possible, that also seems to be a rather glaring security risk if that should be breached.

I remember back in Ukraine's false war with Russia's obvious proxy forces over the last ten years or so... the Ukrainian forces had a cellphone app for coordinating artillery.

"eah Russia did struggle at the start, mostly because for 3 reasons.

1: massively underestimating their enemy. This wasn't the Ukraine of 2014, ~‚Ç¨17 billion from EU and ~$46 billion from USA in military supplies and funding helped them modernise their military, they had built a massive network of fortifications and defensive lines and were well prepared for the invasion. This wasn't some outdated military like Iraq. And this isn't including the ~100 billion in mostly frontline NATO equipment they received in 2022 and 2023.

2: not mobilising after their initial SMO failed. Russia only invaded with around ~150,000 soldiers with at most ~300,000 if you include Ukrainians, mercenaries and foreign fighters. Ukraine had around 300,000 in active service Already and mobilised ~700,000 in 2022. Even when coalition invaded Iraq which was a far far inferior military they had a near 1:1 ratio of soldiers. Even now Russia only has around ~700,000 soldiers in Ukraine, if you account for logistics, maintenence and Infantry Russia can't even have half of its military in Ukraine (going off on how much equipment they have, how many people it takes to operate and how many on average is required for support and logistics along with having a reasonable amount of Infantry) by these estimates russua has somewhere in between 30-60% of its military  (mostly land force) in Ukraine so probably ~45% Total military assets.

3: even with failures of the SMO in 2022 they did well, they captured Mariupol and several Ukrainian cities and towns within a month or so. The problem was they didn't have the men, so they likely had to withdrawn from many areas. Then there was the fact that they left most of the Kharkov region to DPR and LPR troops who are mostly just Infantry. So when Ukraine Launched its counter offensive they easily swept by russuan defences. There was also the issue they didn't have great logistics at the Starr.

Things were going bad, at best fir Russia it was stale mate and at worst it was losing. But in late 2022, the army was reorganised, a partial mobilisation of around ~300,000-500,000 reservists was made, they fixed their logistics and supply lines, they built proper fortifications with multiple defensive lines and they upped their aviation, brought in lots of S-300s and S-400s and undertook major SEAD operations to gain air superiority and brought the rest of their black sea fleet to secure naval supremacy.

Ukraine on the other hand was taking its time, they had spent months training with NATO, they received over 200 billion in financial aid, military supplies and human tian aid from Western countries and organisations. Months of training with NATO equipment, they received nearly 200 NATO air defence systems, hundreds of NATO anti aircraft guns and over 4,000 NATO manpads (including thousands of others) to help them punch a whole in Russia air superiority to get some momentum. They received tens of thousands of NATO ATGMs and nearly 1000 NATO tanks and Thousands of NATO IFVs, APCs, EW systems, radars, counter batteries SPAGs, artillery Guns etc. And dozens of aircraft including attack helicopters and fighter jets along with millions of shells, missiles, rockets, mines and hundreds of millions of rounds of ammunition and nearly half a million NATO small arms. And remember a lot of thus was top stuff. M1A1SA , Leopard 2A6, CV9040, Krab, Archer, HIMARS, Javelin, Storm Shadow, Stinger C, M777A2, Pirioun, Patriot PAC-2 GEM+, SAMP/T, NASAMS-2, IRIS-T SLM, Akeron MP, MILAN-3ER, Rosomak, M2A2-ODS etc. Is all minimum frontline NATO equipment and practically every bit has been destroyed at least once 

Their counter offensive was to split the Russian army and capture ~44,000km¬≤ out of around ~100,000km¬≤ it was too liberate crimea and prove to the world just how superior Western weapons were.

It was a colossal failure, ~130 billion in military supplies, ~110 billion in financial aid, months of training, access to the best intelligence NATO has, battle plans coordinated with top NATO commanders and in nearly 5 months of fighting it only caught less than ~400km¬≤ or around less than 1% of their target. They couldn't even breath the 2/5 defensive line and spent 3 months fighting for a single street village which by the way was taken back by Russia last month. All the hype and Ukraine still lost 168km¬≤ in 2023 overall despite their offensive.

Almost immediately after they realised they were just sending meat to an unbreakable wall. Russia Launched its offensive in November. Since then it has captured nearly ~2000km¬≤ according to averages by suriah maps, deep state UA and rybar. They have captured numerous cities, towns and villages. They've opened up a new front in the North and are advancing on all fronts. Ukraine had around a million men fighting in 2022 yet its top general's are saying it needs 500,000 men just to keep fighting and are talking about their SEVENTH mobilisation. Yet apparently They've only lost 31,000 ü§î. Meanwhile russua according to unbiased media zonal has lost ~50,000 and 70,000-110,000 if you count all those fighting for them. Russias economy is up. Inflation is down and they are outproducing the west in shells and are producing equipment at a staggering rate. In 2023 they undertook a massive modernization campaign to upgrade old T-72B, T-80B and T-62M tanks in storage and upgraded nearly ~2,000 of them to T-72B3, T-72B3M, T-72BM, T-80BVM and T-62MV22. This on top of the 200-400 T-90M they build every year.

Ukraines only successes are firing hundreds of rockets, drones and missiles at Russia every day then when ‚Öõ get through have their media leak it to Western media and make propaganda about how this shows how bad Russian air defence systems are when in reality it's like shooting an M60 at a target and hitting all around but clipping a couple seconds where you hit the target and saying ""see how good a shot I am"" ignoring that most your shots missed.

If you genuinely cared about Ukrainians like I do, you'd want this war to end, ignore propaganda, russua is not some cartoon evil. They are bad just like Ukraine although both are more moral than how US conducts warfare that's for sure. But again both are bad, both commit atrocities against eachother, both target areas with high civilians with little care and both are guilty of having funked up laws. 

Peace is what's needed.

"No Russia should not get to just ‚Äúkeep‚Äù the annexed areas that‚Äôs stupid, and Russia has no right to dictate what and what not Ukraine does, because it‚Äôs a sovereign FREE country.

And half of what you said just isn‚Äôt true, Ukraine hasn‚Äôt received that much aid it‚Äôs received about 110 billion in military aid and a very infrequent amount of arms and equipment, as for shells that‚Äôs ridiculous you would even try to claim ukraine has been given millions on millions‚Ä¶they had a shell shortage for literally half the conflict, only up until recently has the Czech initiative given Ukraine sufficient shells.

It‚Äôs strange that Russia doesnt have enough men ü§îü§î, maybe if they didn‚Äôt use meat wave tactics to try obtain incremental gains then they would have had the men, also to say Ukraine was prepared is ludicrous, in the areas around the people republics sure that‚Äôs true that‚Äôs why they held out so long but in other areas? Ukraine completely failed and allowed Russia to take more land than it should‚Äôve and Zelenskyy has been criticised for that.

You actually are coping saying that ‚Äúand at least one has been destroyed of them all ü§ì‚òùÔ∏è‚Äù like what? This is a war. Things get destroyed. Also Ukraine doesn‚Äôt commit an active bombing campaign on a city like Kiev targeting civilian infrastructureü§®ü§®.

Army wise, Russia could mobilise another 300,000 reserves putting the total number in Ukraine at over 1 million troops, Russian forces in Ukraine have also started receiving first batches of the 1,900 upgraded 3rd Gen Tanks pulled from storage and retrofitted  including T-72B3, T-80UM-1 and T-62M2 Tanks along with 200 freshly built 3.5 gen T-90M and around a few dozen T-80BVM23 tanks along with around 300 5th Gen BMPT Terminators, BMP-3 Dragoons and Kurganets-25 IFVs, several new 4th Gen 9K330 Tor M2, 9–ö317 Buk M3 and S-400 SAM Launchers, dozens of new 3rd Gen 2S35, 2S19M2, 2S34 & 2S40 SPAGs sand around 20 new 2nd gen Tornado-S and Uragan-1M GMLRS Launchers and new 3rd Gen TOS-2, and Tornado-G along with 2nd Gen TOS-1A MLRS Launchers to be delivered to forces in Ukraine.

Air Force wise, Russia also has several new aircraft being built with around 70+ new total aircraft encompassing 5-10 aircraft a month with Su-57s, Su-35S, MiG-35, Mi-28NM, Yak-130 and Ka-52M along with several new upgraded versions being done, such as Mi-24PN-1M, Tu-22M3M, Tu-95MSM, A-50U, Tu-160M2, Su-30SM2, Su-34M, Su-27SM3, Su-25SM3, MiG-31BSM and MiG-31K, being delivered and of course Russia says it's new 5th Gen Su-75 will be showcased in 2024, along with its new Unmanned Stealth Bomber and 3rd Gen AEW&C Aircraft being put into production this year, with the S-70 Okhotnik-B and A-100. They could use Ukraine as a more 'meaty' testing ground for it to drum up interests like they did for their T-14 Armata, Kurganets-25 and Su-57 instead of just Syria which is against poorly armed and trained rebels and terrorists similar to Afghan and Iraqi insurgents.

Either way this war has turned into Russia's Vietnam, that being Russia hoped for fast victory but through good defiance and massive Military aid and fighting by proxy it has turned into a protracted conflict, of course the big difference here being that Ukraine has had more funding than Russia whereas USA and ARVN was 10x better funded than the NVA. And Russia is wrecking Ukraine where as Vietnam wrecked USA 

But again it's irrelevant. Russia is smashing Ukraine even according to suriah maps and deep state UA Russia is gaining ground every single day, they have complete artillery superiority and air superiority. Russia has still only had ONE mobilisation meanwhile Ukraine who has lost over half a million men is pushing parliament for their SEVENTH. 

Your entire argument is pure fucking copium and just denying reality. Even the general in charge of the Krynky operation has been arrested because he was just sending human waves to their deaths.

Western armour has proven to be absolutely useless. 130 billion worth thousands of vehicles and did absolutely nothing. 5 months Ukraine fought for and yet they still LOST 168km¬≤ in 2023.

You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. You don't have the slightest understanding about warfare 

Ukraines economy is all but finished and will struggle to recover without massive economic aid. With around 26.1% drop in economic output post war with a drop of 2.3% this quarter (however  IMF are predicting a 2% increase for 2024) and CPI inflation at 13.5% with its GDP nominal at $175 Billion and PPP $430 Billion at and its GDP nominal per capita at $5,200  and per capita PPP $14,300. It also has very large debts of around $300 billion to the IMF, World Bank, European Union and United States (expected to rise to $400 billion by end of 2024) along with its massively diminished labour force. Its defence budget is 25.4% of GDP Nominal and 122.2% of Tax revenue. Its Hryvnia has been devalued 10-13% post war and of course naturally as result of the war its market cap has entirely tanked and foreign investment has been cut by around ¬æ post war.

When the war in Ukraine is over, Ukraine is facing a very tough challenge, estimates for the cost of rebuilding Ukraine range from $400 billion to over $1 trillion, and this isn't counting the massive debts it's incurred from military and financial aid packages. If Russia wins it's likely they will rebuild as they have extensively rebuilt Mauriopl, Luhansk and many towns and cities far from frontlines (based on video and picture evidence) likely as ploy to get the civilian population on their side or could be as Putin said they don't want to destroy Ukraine just remove it's regime.

Russia's economy is doing relatively well (especially considering being sanctioned by two economic Superpowers) with net growth of around 1.6% post war (after losing 2.1% in 2022) with a growth of 0.4% this quarter and CPI inflation at 5.4% with a GDP Nominal of ~$2 Trillion and GDP PPP of ~$5 Trillion with GDP PPP per capita at $34,837 and per capita nominal at $14,404. However due to said sanctions from the United States and European Union it is now in sovereign default with the IMF, World Bank and ""western"" creditors and thus its market cap and foreign investment has tanked and its Rouble has been devalued around 0.5-2%. Its defence budget is 4.6% of GDP Nominal and around 12.9% of tax revenue.

"The conflict is primarily between two sides: the PKK (Kurdistan Workers‚Äô Party) and the Turkish government. Since 1923, when the British and French divided the Middle East into countries following the fall of the Ottoman Empire, they did not draw borders that accounted for ethnic groups like the Kurds. The French and British promised the Kurds an independent state which would be located between Iran, Iraq, and Turkey borders today (even though the territory where Kurds were the majority living and historically was much bigger), but they broke their promise because the Turks weren‚Äôt happy about it and said they would attack the state. The British and French didn‚Äôt want another conflict in the region because WW1 had just ended, so they wrote an agreement called the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 between the British, French, and Turkish that formed today‚Äôs Middle East borders. This is why there are always conflicts in the region. For 100+ years, the Turkish government has been oppressing minorities, especially the Kurds. They have killed thousands of Kurds and imprisoned many more, and even today this is ongoing. They banned the Kurdish language, culture, clothes, and everything related to Kurds and a Kurdish state. 

In 1978, a Kurdish party appeared that was led by Apo (Abdullah √ñcalan). It was a political party at first that was asking for rights for the Kurdish people, but they knew they were far from getting their rights like that, so they turned the party into a military one which started to attack the Turkish government in Kurdish territories in southeast Turkey. The Turkish government deployed many troops in the Kurdish territories, and the conflict has gone on for nearly 50+ years. The PKK backed up into another part of Kurdish territory in the region (north Iraq), which we call south Kurdistan because Kurds believe Kurdistan is much bigger than the area that the British and the French marked for a Kurdish state. There‚Äôs a large Kurdish population all the way from the Persian Gulf to the Black Sea, to the ƒ∞skenderun port in south Turkey, to the Persian Gulf again (you can search ‚ÄúKurdistan map‚Äù on Google). So Kurdistan is actually not only in southeast Turkey and the conflict isn‚Äôt only between the Kurds and the Turks, but it is much bigger. Kurdistan was divided into 4 main parts (Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria): Turkey - north Kurdistan, Iran - east Kurdistan, Iraq - south Kurdistan, Syria - west Kurdistan. In all 4 parts, Kurdish people were oppressed and subjected to genocide by all 4 countries for more than 100 years, especially by Saddam Hussein in Iraq (search ‚ÄúAnfal‚Äù on Google which is a genocide done by Saddam Hussein). In Turkey, Iran, and Syria, Kurds also faced racism (Turkish people used to call Kurds in Turkey ‚Äúmountain Turks‚Äù because they were simply denying Kurdish existence) even today. Fortunately, today Kurds have two independent regions in both Syria and Iraq (Kurdistan Region and the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES), also known as Rojava, which means west in Kurdish). They both did great work fighting ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) terrorist organization in 2014-2018 with the help of the USA and international allies, and both regions are democratic regions where all Middle Eastern ethnicities and religions live peacefully together. 

Going back to the main discussion, the PKK is now mainly active in northern Iraq (south Kurdistan & Kurdistan Region), so the Turkish government is unhappy hearing about these two Kurdish regions in the region and continuously attacks both since their establishment. They‚Äôre using the ‚ÄúPKK‚Äù as an excuse to attack both regions and bomb them, so Kurds fight back against these attacks and invasions. The ‚ÄúPKK‚Äù is also labeled as a terrorist organization by the US & EU because their ally, Turkey, says so. In fact, there is evidence and even videos where Turkish soldiers give weapons and equipment to ISIS so ISIS can take the Kurdish city of Kobane in 2018, meanwhile, the PKK had participated in most of the fights against ISIS. So now there are more than 30 Turkish bases in south Kurdistan mountains and Kurdish fighters attack them, meanwhile, Turkish jets and drones attack Kurdish cities in both Syria and Iraq continuously. Recently the PKK started attacking Turkish bases with drones which I think is a good tactic to reduce their losses (they have a website where they post their videos attacking Turkish soldiers and positions called Gerilla TV (https://gerillatv.tv/browse-categorysix-videos-1-date.html) you can check it out). So yes, we‚Äôre basically fighting for our land and rights while everyone in the world is talking about Palestine ‚Äúbecause they‚Äôre a Muslim nation‚Äù as if the Kurdish population isn‚Äôt 75% Muslim or wasn‚Äôt (many Kurds have started to leave Islam in recent years including myself). There are many Christian Kurds in the Kurdistan Region and many Kurdish Jews live in Israel (I personally support Israel) because Arabs and Muslims call Kurds and some brainwashed Kurds also call each other brothers because of their religion, meanwhile Arabs, Turks, and Muslims have been killing and bombing us for 100 years and even today. Europeans, Americans, and even Israelis are the only people who really cared about us and supported us, and there are many Kurds who love Israelis and Americans (even though the Americans abandoned us as a result of a command from Trump to pull their troops from Syria so the Turks could invade us, which they failed to do). Even after that, while ISIS and Turkish-backed militias attack Kurdish cities and forces continuously, Kurdish forces in Syria are guarding hundreds of thousands of foreign ISIS fighters in Al-Sina prison and their families and children in Al-Hol camp, becoming a real threat to the region. When Turkish-backed militias attacked the prison two years ago, hundreds escaped and even the European and Asian countries where the ISIS members are from do not take their people back because they think of them as a threat. They think it‚Äôs okay to leave them here without giving the region any economic or military support to guard the prison (there are more than 30,000 ISIS fighters in the prison and 50,000 women and children of the ISIS fighters in the camp). If we execute them, the UN would get mad, meanwhile, if it were us prisoners in ISIS hands, we would have already been executed. So yes, I hope you have got your answer about who‚Äôs the bad side and who‚Äôs the good side.",r/war,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYZ2c5SDN0b2VCdzlGN0RZdWNiRWI3UzF3bzdhQ2R4Vnp0ZHRWM2lUbXhFNjBYZV9hU1A3RXRHNnNReGIyNUI3MEN6QXZxS1E0dnVubWF6bDFrVXh4S3c9PQ==

"The thing is they don't, the ICJ has not issued a ruling, Amnesty international never actually called it a genocide, just made statements about how there is ""risk of genocide"". The red cross won't even visit the Israeli hostage's and even they never actually made a statement calling what's going on in Gaza a genocide. So I have no idea what your talking about.

UNICEF calls it a  humanitarian crisis. So all of your assumptions are wrong. I would love for you to link me an article where the ICJ says Israel is committing genocide in gaza.",r/war,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhWV9XSjdjZ2NaVzNuTk9SRDJucXBfSGM4ampaZjFpT29WT2Z0RVIyTEtmbUdpQ1pUaVY4RDhQdWkyY2laV2phWC1tYjFrQXRCRVR4U3laaHNHVkZqQ0E9PQ==
