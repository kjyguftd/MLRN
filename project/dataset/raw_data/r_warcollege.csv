"I don't mean to imply that military rationality was the only or even principle priority in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, or that a more competent Iraqi army wouldn't have stressed their progress - Rumsfeld's 'you go to war with the army you have' line is rightly derided - but they were nonetheless fully capable of exercising their military such as it was effectively. Capabilities like spatial awareness, coordinating arms, command and control, etc. were why the USAF's thunder runs worked while RAF's thunder runs were repeatedly isolated and ambushed. And they should have known this would happen.

"I would imagine that it hasn't been talked about because there isn't much to say. I think that largely has to do simply with the fact that there is little opportunity or training to maximize the effects of small arms advancement.

Economically speaking, there simply isn't much new stuff available to Ukrainians that would allow them to assess new weapons advancements. They've got a shitload of AK74s and hand me down NATO weapons, but only top tier guys get the good stuff and even then it probably isn't anything that didn't get heavily tested during the GWOT.

Most troops probably don't have the training or experience to maximize small arms capability. If you hand a newbie a total beast of a rifle, it's not going to be much more useful than a stock AK because they don't have the marksmanship skills to take advantage of its benefits.

Besides that, small arms just don't seem to account for that many casualties in the grand scheme of things. It would be a poor use of time and resources to experiment with small arms advancements rather than small drone advancements because new rifles wouldn't have nearly as much impact as a bunch of small drones or jamming technology or something.

Almost all of the footage I've seen where small arms are actually being used are happening either as blind suppressive fire or mag-dumping into a bunker and you don't need anything fancy to do that. It's possible there are some elite sniper teams or something that are pushing the envelope with their small arms, but I imagine they are few and far between.

In all honestly, small arms technology really hasn't advanced much in the last 50 years anyhow, so there's not much to talk about when compared with the massive leaps and strides that are happening with drones, air defense, hypersonic missiles, and electronic warfare. Any commentary about small arms would be very nit-picky and probably only comprehensible to serious professionals, so it's not going to get picked up in the media much anyhow.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYeFFwTzFHenJkRjZnMFh1b244eXBwdm1ubWs5Ty10UFhrUmlKSWdmbHBrSWdRNVFjVzhUQWpVdVJ3SGtBNU5iWlZIbVczMjVld1VnRzVyZjY2T2o1Qmc9PQ==
"> Big gun navies died in the 30s, technically you could argue they became obsolete in 1911 with the laying of the *Fouder* or any sea plane carrier built/converted after but they had yet to prove to be that useful. Everyone was desperate to hold on to the idea for much longer.

This is a very non-credible take. Naval aviation for most of ww1 was almost pathetic, mostly being used as a tool to spot for guns. The furthest it ever got was the proposed cuckoo raid, of which the viability is... questionable. Throughout the 1930s, naval aviation was anemic in terms of both airplanes and tactics. 



Really only in the 1940s did naval aviation become a dominant power, and even then, though they were becoming obsolescent, battleships were still a very relevant surface combatant and strategic asset.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYMFF1cHVtSjB6SzgwQWxqV19XR05PaE5kNEFWWFYzaDE4SFFqZjFhSzNxeWUwZEVRQ3pvVWZYQTJ1WG9GNW01U2VGZmFDN0RXRk5jWElHNDRyUkJsRWc9PQ==

"Because artillery is not as good as missiles anymore on ships. Even at gun ranges (30km or less usually for most naval artillery), missiles are more accurate and usually have greater power to them. Their downside is that they are easier to target (in most cases except for maybe hypersonics, possessed only by a few countries) and take more space on the ship. but their upsides are greater. 

This is to say nothing about naval aviation, but this too is not every country.

"NGFS Naval Gun Fire Support is still a thing.  

FAC’s are still trained to call in NGFS.  

There support for it in AFATDS.  

It’s part of Joint Fire Support joint pub.

The Marines have a Naval Gun Fire Officer as part of their Fire Support Coordination Center.  The shore fire support party has a naval gunfire liason officer.

The primary missing NGFS capability in the USN is range and capacity.  Nothing carries a lot of rounds for sustained fire support with the 5” guns we have.

650 rounds for the Burkes.  Compared to 1200 16” rounds and 320 for each 5” mount…or 3840…on an Iowa.  

A Tico has 1200 rounds and two guns.

So we still have NGFS capability but its limited.

For reference a day of ammunition (DOA) for a USMC battery is 720 155mm rounds.  

Of course, the USMC is slimming down on tube artillery with Force Design 2030…so maybe NGFS requirements go away as well since you don’t need it for EABO or LOCE so if you abandon the JFEO mission like Berger has you don’t need it at all.

Personally I think Berger was a brilliant idiot in the same vein as Rumsfeld was a smart moron.  And Smith is on board with Force Design 2030. 

If the USMC gives up amphibs, fixed and rotary wing assets, howitzers, tanks, etc and cant do JFEO then we don’t need the USMC anymore.  

The Army can plant light infantry anywhere in the world with a Typhon armed with ship killers and call it a EABO as easily as the USMC can with a LRFL.

It’s a tough problem but UMSC leadership have alternated between pipe dreams that would get a bunch of Marines killed (STOM) and simply throwing up its hands and declaring defeat on its primary raison d’etre (JFEO).

TL;DR: To come full circle to the original question…you don’t need shore bombardment if you abandon the amphibious forced entry mission.

"I can give my first hand experience from being. US soldier deployed to Afghanistan in the 2009-2012 timeframe. 

There wasn’t any big army policy about trying to have soldiers learn the language. There was a small amount of cultural sensitivity training we went through each time before deploying. A lot of junior leaders like team and squad leaders would try and teach their soldiers some basic phrases before we went overseas. Simple things like saying “Hello, how are you?” Or “Where are the Taliban?”

Before my second deployment in 2012 our unit sent about 30 guys through a language course that was about 6 months long to have them learn the local language. Unfortunately they sent our guys to a Dari course and then we deployed to a Pashto speaking area again. So the guys who went through the course could only really talk to the Afghan Army guys who were with us, because they were generally Dari speakers.

As far as interpreters, who we called terps, it was a pretty mixed bag. They went through a vetting process, though I can’t say what that all entailed. Some of our terps were highly motivated, and wanted to help us defeat the taliban. One had lost family to them, and we trusted him enough to let him carry a captured AK and ammo bandolier. We had another terp that most of us were convinced was either working for the taliban or at least sympathetic towards them. The timing of his phone calls home and Taliban mortar attacks was always suspicious. And whenever he want out on patrols with us, they taliban wouldn’t shoot at that patrol(It’s also highly likely this was just a rumor and some of our guys looking for someone to blame). Most of the terps were somewhere in between, sorta just there for the paycheck, and not super motivated. 

Sometimes the taliban would find the identity of terps, and use that to threaten the family of the terps in order to coerce them into passing along information or even carrying out insider attacks. When I was deployed during 2009-2010 there was some threat of insider attacks, but nothing extreme. When I was deployed again in 2012 there was a very high risk of insider attacks. One of our sister companies had one very early in the deployment that resulted in 2 KIA and several wounded. That was carried out by an ANA soldier and a local that he helped to sneak onto the outpost. I seem to remember a lot of the insider attacks we heard of were carried out by members of the Afghan security forces, though I wouldn’t be surprised if some were carried out by interpreters, too.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYeHpEN0daM0RMbU8zaGFwY0wzYjMtOURBNkpuNF9aUU9FTkxOdkdKcEtLdmU4Q1NRckdkMW9VczVvY2FOaVo3SE44akQzRWNXY2t1NFZWNlNMYmxYMVE9PQ==

"In addition to the dearth of aircraft engine development and materials to make them as was mentioned by u/Inceptor57 very correctly as a primary driver of lackluster aircraft development; there are human factors happening as well. 

The Imperial navy especially didn’t have the pilots or the training capacity to adequately prepare rookie pilots for flying machines that were much hotter and more difficult to handle such as D4Ys, A7Ms and B7As. Pre-war pilot training programs were so difficult that they were lucky if they had 100 pilots out of a graduating class. This set them up for failure when they finally did desperately need pilots. Some of these aircraft were much too large for the smaller and slower Japanese carriers. The converted ocean liners *Junyo* and *Hiyou* couldn’t even launch the D4Y Suisei unless they could find a 40knot headwind somewhere.

Then even if a rookie pilot did manage to take off with these more unstable machines, many of them had never even made a carrier landing before much less been under sustained AAA and fighter sweeps. The result was more than 400 planes and aircrew destroyed and killed in the Philippine Sea west south-west of Saipan. Why make nice improved aircraft when the framework to train the pilots has been gutted? Rookie pilots are more likely to crash due to the increased performance then they were to benefit from it. It’s worth comparing the Corsair in this regard because it was undoubtedly one of the finest fighter aircraft of the war, but it was also like a bucking bronco and demanded expertise from the pilot to control the torque put out by that R-2800 double wasp. After the Turkey Shoot it was laid bare in IGHQ and 1st Air Fleet that conventional methods of attack were no longer effective against American warships, you’re just gonna get shot down. So thats the genesis of shinpu/kamikaze tactics. If you’re gonna kamikaze then again there is no need for a new aircraft. Just get whatever you can and pack it full of explosives, anything else is a waste of money and materials.

The Army didn’t quite have as many problems in these regards but they had the same problem concerning trained aviators. They didn’t have to contend with the inherent difficulty and danger of naval aviation so they did have more success in using newer aircraft. Landing on a runway is far far easier than a carrier and they didn’t have deck limitations like the navy. So they had a few late war aircraft that were newer; both the Ki-61 and Ki-100 aircraft were newer and fairly capable but the 61 suffered engine problems consistently. The Ki-61 was designed with an imported inverted inline DB 601 engine and then a domestic copy called the Ha-40. The domestic copies suffered from lots of reliability problems however which led to the Ki-100. It, by some miracle, did not suffer from many of the same engine problems. They pulled the Ha-40 and retrofitted the frame to accept a radial engine that was derived from the venerable Pratt and Whitney R-1690 Hornet which is a wonderfully reliable engine and their copy was not hot trash like others had been. Too little too late however. All the major leaps in aircraft design were ultimately thanks to new and better engines. Japan as you can see had serious problems keeping pace with engine designs and that limited how good the aircraft they made were.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYM291VjU4ckNOdGJqamRMSGU4S3hqaDFHWjRYRXBhdGEweFhnNm0wUXp0ajdJcmFJM0FHb1dEMlBIRHZvd2pUak1oMkZXbWlOaXE0YVJQcUc1SjZmbGc9PQ==

>One in particular, likely explains the Siverskyi Donets River crossing debacle: ubiquitous surveillance of the battlefield. The Ukrainians reported that they had discovered the Russian crossing operation via aerial reconnaissance. The potential sources of this information are much more diverse and numerous now than in even the most recent conflicts. They include a wide variety of drones, commercially available satellite imagery, intelligence from Western sources, and other means.

>This new reality essentially means that there is nowhere for a relatively large formation to hide.

"It's something of a Catch 22. They lack experience, so don't conduct battalion/brigade-level attacks, so don't gain experience, so lack experience etc.

The issue is experience with company-level actions isn't always directly transferable to higher-echelon operations. Undoubtedly, there are Ukrainian company officers who are now more experienced with modern mechanized warfare as has been practiced in Ukraine than any of their NATO peers. However, they have much less, if any experience with staff work, or in organising and coordinating tasks specific to higher-echelons of command, nor do their men have experience fighting as part of such a force.

These are skills most armies build up in peace time through regular exercises, wargames, and staff colleges, but Ukraine's focus on rapidly reorganising and expanding the army, and it's operational experience prior to 2022 being relatively low-intensity conflict in Donbas, led to disproportionate experience with company-level operations. In fairness, this is something a lot of modern armies would likely struggle with as well, since this scale of action was de-emphasised after 1991, but Ukraine's unique circumstances make the issue particularly acute.

Throw in steady attrition due to casualties, evolving tactics/technology, dilution/division of experienced units as the army expands, shifting operational focus, culture clash between NATO-trained junior officers and their Soviet-trained bosses, and it's difficult to gather and drill a larger force together long enough to build up the skills, relationships, and competencies necessary to conduct more complex operations.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYY2w4eWFfaWtQMDZ0cGZ4MTJHY3E4WWp0b2lWa0JLTjczb2JreVBndzMtcjNsWVpMVU9iRW1UQldFV0pleWRGSjZTWnFQTExNNlVtamg5OHE0SFZPZ3c9PQ==

"Less likely for an entire group to be wiped out in a single attack. It's easier now to bomb an entire area or pepper entire locations with artillery wiping out large groups of soldiers. The more people hit with a single bomb or artillery round also makes munitions more cost effective.  Large groups of people are also easier to spot and countered.  A recent incident had HIMARS blow up a large number of Russian soldiers.

In terms of command and control, I expect having direct communication with your squad is easier when your are split into smaller groups. It offers better flexibility and ability to adjust in a situation.

Large groups are also good targets for drones. I've seen how cheap drones have changed the battlefield. A single drone can wipe out groups of 3 to 5 men if these soldiers are clustered together. There are drones that drop mortars into targets or FPV suicide drones that fly straight into their enemies before exploding. The more hit in a single attack the more effective they are.

>I say wasted potential specifically because it isn’t a budget issue.

> I have no idea what you mean by more interoperability- a CATOBAR version would be able to land both the V/STOL aircraft currently in use and a range of internationally used aircraft with a landing hook, it would only expand the current capability. 

CATOBAR aircraft are only in use with the US and France.

Where's STOVL aircraft are in use with the US, Italy, Spain, Japan, South Korea, Singapore etc.

Not to mention there's been far more actual interoperability with the F-35B and the Queen Elizabeth Class (a USMC squadrons embarking for CSG21) than there has been with CATOBAR since WW2.


>Wasp&America can carry ~25 F-35Bs, same as Queen Elizabeth class, as well as their other capabilities, and 24 is the standard for QE to carry, and with a surge capacity of 36, so not really a huge advantage. 

No, they can't. The Wasp and America Class can operate up to 20 F-35Bs, with a massively reduced sortie rate. The Queen Elizabeth Class can operate 36 F-35Bs, rising to 48 in a surge capacity.

You only have to look at the deck space available with the same number of aircraft on each to see the absolute difference between them.


>The design was alongside JSF, but JSF crucially has three variants.

Yes, and the Queen Elizabeth Class was to operate the STOVL JSF variant.

"I recently came across the battle (better: attack) at Zelenopillya in 2017.
Even at that time 7 years ago, Russia was able to use a combination of drone recon (Orlan, I think), cyber warfare, and artillery (MLRS) to heavily damage a Ukrainian column that was preparing for an operation.

At that time, I was admittedly paying very little attention to the War in the Donbas, but to me this highlights that - despite all the mistakes and stupidness - the Russian army is effectively combining drones and artillery already for a long time. And this has become only better since the full scale invasion, making amassing of troops in this environment very very challenging.

The Queen Elizabeth Class doesn't have the native ability to generate steam, and would therefore require a steam boiler, adding even more cost and complexity.


>While CATOBAR aircraft are only in use with the US and France my point is STOVL aircraft can still land on a CATOBAR carrier, but the converse isn’t true. 

Except they can't. In order to operate the F-35B, the deck needs to be reinforced with a thermo-metallic spray (TMS) to withstand the extreme heat generated by the exhaust. No CATOBAR carriers have this, and therefore whilst they could land the F-35B on in an emergency, they wouldn't be able to operate them for long periods.


>My Wasp&America point isn’t that they’re full equivalents, just that the QE class is closer to them than a true carrier. 

They're not however. The Queen Elizabeth Class are the third most powerful class of carrier currently in service behind the Ford and Nimitz classes.


>The 2010-2012 plans still could have been further refined and given two such carriers, the choice of CATOBAR doesn’t eliminate that possibility. 

Those plans would have resulted in only one aircraft carrier, with no plans for any of the additional aircraft types (Hawkeye, Growler etc) that add extra capability.


>F-35C has 50% more range and 50% more weapons capacity, while costing less, before maintenance is even mentioned. 

Except it doesn't. Not to mention Britain isn't going to use any weapons that the F-35C could accommodate that the F-35B can't.

"Fair point on the steam, but the Converteam submission is still valid. And at half the price of EMALS, it actually eliminates the extra costs immediately since the costs of initially acquiring F-35Cs amounts to almost $1 billion. 

As for F-35Bs, there’s no need for prolonged usage, when it comes to interoperability, sure it’s not gonna operate from there but it wouldn’t have to. 

“Most powerful” is a very difficult metric to measure, and I’d argue Charles de Gaulle at least equals it and Fujian exceeds it. 

Again, the plans changed more than once, they could again. As for plans to operate other aircraft, it only makes sense once CATOBAR was selected, they would be at least considered especially if Crowsnest is approaching its OSD. 

F-35C definitely has more capacity; the Sidekick modification allows carriage of 6 AAMs, which the A and C are capable of but not the B, and since Meteor has the same dimensions as AMRAAM, it would able to be used. Plus the C can carry 2000lb JDAMs as opposed to 1000lb JDAMs, and while that particular weapon isn’t in British service, it demonstrates a higher capacity in the C than the B, which both gives a wider diversity of present weapons that can be used, and future ones (1500lb limit for the B, 2500lb for the C)

EMCAT was still in the development stage and there was no indication of price at all.


>As for F-35Bs, there’s no need for prolonged usage, when it comes to interoperability, sure it’s not gonna operate from there but it wouldn’t have to. 

That's literally what interoperability means. An F-35B could land on the flight deck of a T45 in an absolute emergency but that doesn't mean there's interoperability there.


>“Most powerful” is a very difficult metric to measure, and I’d argue Charles de Gaulle at least equals it and Fujian exceeds it. 

HMS Queen Elizabeth carries more aircraft, that are more advanced, than Charles de Gaulle. Hence more powerful.


>Again, the plans changed more than once, they could again. As for plans to operate other aircraft, it only makes sense once CATOBAR was selected, they would be at least considered especially if Crowsnest is approaching its OSD. 

You seem to be ignoring the key point. **Going CATOBAR would have resulted in only one aircraft carrier and no guarantee that other supporting aircraft, including AEW would be bought.**



>QE is a step up, but only from not having a fixed wing carrier at all.

I'd suggest you look at the preceding Invincible Class to see just how much of a step up the Queen Elizabeth Class are.


>It’s not awful, it has decent capabilities, it’s just there’s more it could do if designed optimally from the start.

It was designed optimally. When you account for all the factors, the STOVL Queen Elizabeth Class is ideal for the Royal Navy.

No, it can't. CdG has a shorter steam catapult than the Nimitz Class, which means it can't launch as heavy an aircraft.

"You don't seem to realize that this isn't a video game.

Larger recon drones have a range of ~150km. Smaller cheap drones have a range of ~25km. Even some DJI crap off aliexpress has a range of ~10km. A whatsapp message with target coordinates arrives to the battery in ~5 seconds because that's how long it takes for the drone operator to push a button to get coordinates of the target and type in a message on their phone. All the calculations are just a phone app so it's not long before rounds are away.

There literally isn't a single bush that isn't watched by 10 drones ~10km in depth and any field or a single field or road that isn't watched by several drones ~50km in depth. That means your logistics, ammo, fuel etc. will be ~100km away from the front so they don't get whacked.

122mm has a range of ~15km. 152mm around 25km and tube artillery 30km for bulk stuff and 150-200km for the specialized stuff.

That's before you have to deal with fortifications, mines, remote mining, guided munitions, guided missiles, attack helicopters or airplanes.

There is no force on this planet that could be capable of breaking through these lines without nuclear/chemical weapons. You'd run out of fuel and get bogged down in mines before you even reach the advance positions. Even the US would just nope the fuck out and attack elsewhere.

"SS: In May 1948, five Arab armies banded together to invade the new state of Israel. Despite having a numerical and material advantage early on, the Arab armies still could not crush the Israelis. Arab armies have encountered defeat after defeat at the hands of the Israelis, the Americans and the British, as well as poorly armed insurgents. Why do Arab armies have such a poor reputation? Why have Arab militaries repeatedly proven unable to defeat less well-armed and numerically inferior foes? There are many such reasons, but this video will discuss the more noteworthy reasons.  
  
One institutional shortcoming in Arab armies is wasteful procurement programs. Arab militaries (and especially the GCC states) engage in unchecked shopping sprees for military equipment. These militaries purchase unnecessary weaponry and equipment and then do not maintain or train with their new equipment. Here is an interesting exercise: Google the Wikipedia pages of the GCC states' militaries and notice the sheer number of foreign arms suppliers these countries have (usually more than a dozen). To make matters worse, these militaries do not have enough personnel with the proper training to use the complex military machinery they purchase.  
  
Another disadvantage Arab militaries have is a lack of national consciousness in many Arab states (themselves artificial creations of colonialism) and general disdain for military service. In contrast to Western armies, officers in Arab armies look to avoid combat duty or service in wartime. In the Arab states, especially in the Gulf, military service is viewed as just another government job....",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYWW53SEJ0TTRCa0htZXdPRjEtdDZBQVE4TGdZS0NvZl9ucWRrVkFjSkJpbFVINjh5MHh4OFNKeGswdGVFNF9EenlQWlB4akc2MkN5STdWOWwwNnJ3aEE9PQ==

"Mosts replies are correct. Infantry teams responsible for running checkpoints won't be receiving much in the way of language learning support. Some resources will be made available and fairly often there will be basic survival words taught, but I doubt anyone's actually using them.

However, many interpreters will not be taken from the local populace. For high level negotiations and conversations that need translating a lot of members will be brought from the US's language teams trained to a high level of fluency at the Defense Language Institute. It's not their primary job, but the Army is going to see that there's 400 people fluent in Farsi or Russian or Pashto and bring them in when they'd rather have an American speaking, or just rather not pay an interpreter.

>£49 million was the cost for a single catapult in 2009-ish iirc

Do you have a source for that?


>CdG has operated Super Hornets which means it’s enough at least to operate F-35Cs with internal stores.

Its catapult isn't powerful enough to launch a Super Hornet with a full fuel and weapon load, or to launch an F-35C with internal stores.



>From the 2010 SDSR: “ carrier-strike based around a single new operational carrier with the second planned to be kept at extended readiness.”, which is massively different from having only one carrier

Only one would be fitted with CATOBAR 

>An 18-month study into converting **HMS Prince of Wales to CATOBAR** began but it rapidly uncovered serious cost implications and delays that the changes would entail. Alterations and new equipment required were estimated at £886 Million per ship in November 2010 but by February 2012 the figure was £2 Billion and rising. Perhaps even more intolerable was the realisation that the conversion work would have added another 3 years to the construction time. **Purchasing the F-35C would leave HMS Queen Elizabeth unable to operate any fixed-wing aircraft until she was replaced by the second carrier around 2023.**

>And if CATOBAR is vastly more expensive, then the planned CATOBAR upgrade must be too. And in 99% of cases, adding in an expensive feature to something not planned for it is far more costly than having it from the start.  

The Queen Elizabeth Class won't be fully converted to CATOBAR. A small catapult may be fitted to launch UAVs but it won't be a full sized one.

"The current Battleground of Ukraine is a transparent battlefield, with full EM Coverage, eye-ball, Infrared, Cyber, Radio, Sound, Radio, and Basic Human Intelligence, coupled with Long Range Munitions with plenty of ammunition and guidance choices.

The range of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, can be simplified into Strategic, Operational and Tactical.

The Continent is covered by Satellite Recon, and entire communities scouring Satellite Image Data, so any large and obvious system or accumulations will get spotted, targeted and destroyed. This is Strategic, since it takes time to analyze the images, and response times are quite long, and a preference for Static Targets like Power Plants, Bases and Airfields. So you have Cruise and Ballistic Missile Strikes.

With a depth of 100kms from the frontline is covered by Long-Range recon Drones, so once again any large and obvious system or accumulations will get spotted, targeted and destroyed. This is Operational since it will be anywhere between 3-60 mins before an attack is launched. So you have Cruise, Ballistic, GMLRS.

The depth of 50kms from the front line is covered by Medium Range Recon Drones, so once again danger of strikes is present. This is still operational and have the same strike time of 3-60 mins. So you have Cruise, Ballistic, GMLRS.

The immediate frontline between 0-50kms is covered by Small Fixed Wing Recon, and Quad-copter Recon Drones. The Strike time for these systems could be between 0-30 mins, using FPVK, Arty, MLRS, Heli, Air Bombs, Infantry Weapons, Static Defenses and Land Mines. This is the Tactical Level of Engagement, wherein your choice of killers is so great that protecting against all of them is impossible.

If you can accumulate a Brigade sized unit into a 30sq km box, anywhere closer than 100kms from the frontline, the chances of getting spotted increase the closer you get to the contact line. The time it takes you to travel that 100kms, the enemy has gotten 3 whole batteries of GMLRS into position + another 3 whole batteries MLRS that are already nearby. Which if they are using conventional High Explosive in their rockets, will remove that 30sqkm from existence, the moment you get in range.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZTElTU1pZcFJnOGVna3dneXBFdjJZX2cwZmxaclBOckt6anZ5WWM1NmtZTzU4b1J2YkFlQWZxVkJ1b0dSVnVLOENxNmlXVjFqeFJYNU92ZGppQndaZ0E9PQ==

"I have extended material on this because of my dissertation, which I will be handing in within a few weeks!

The US Army found them useful but was worried about the early stage of development and use outside of well-developed major population centers with well-maintained roads. Basically, the fear was that the moment you take them to less-developed areas like Mexico or somewhere in the Pacific they would become unusable. 

A good article on early experiments can be found in the Infantry Journal by John H. Sherburne: ""Automobile Guns in the Massachusetts Maneuvers""  (Vol 6, No 3, p 375). Sherburne wrote a lengthy essay on the use of civilian cars for troop movement and heavy weapons support. He was optimistic about it, but the pre-war Army had major funding problems. Basically, much like aviation, the Army understood that motorization was going to play a major role in the next war but either didn't have the money to invest in motor pools - becuase of the high up-front cost to essentially overhaul your entire logistics system - or because they didn't want to invest in something that was constantly being improved on. Imagine people who are fretting over getting the iPhone 15 but wanting to wait for the iPhone 16 which will be out within a few months and offer better specs for the same money. 

Army officers were also some of the highest paid individuals in the country and comfortably upper middle class. The only people who made more were their relatives who worked as private sector executives. Even company-grade officers were in the upper 10% of income and were some of the first to afford private motor vehicles. George Patton, even if he hadn't come from money, would easily have been able to afford his private vehicle. That early experience with private vehicles got many younger officers comfortable with cars and they were put to good use during the Punitive Expedition in 1917. 

Some articles in the service journals also called for the Army to register every vehicle sold in the country so that they could be pressed into service. Mind you, this was way before 1914 when Parisian taxis were used as ad-hoc troops transport. 

By 1919, the problem was that the Army had, in the eyes of some like Lieutenant Colonel W.R. Conolly, invested too much into slap-dash acquisitions of every type of vehicle, which left the Army with a massive motor pool of soon-to-be obsolete vehicles of all types and another massive up-front investment to modernize, which the peacetime Army never did. You can read more about that in Field Artillery, Vol 8, No 3, p 255 ""Motor Transportation for Artillery.""",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZQlJ1ZHVLenU0STJFTDVmMGxhUmhSQWtsOHJNS19uLWIzN0U2cFFuaEJnLTlCdGM3MkxXN0pzbmFuTDRzZzFVZlpGZmYzaWNieW5GdnkyZnlldERoNGQzS1hQS1RROC1YUzNmanpMNHZ5WWM9
"Here's an image from the maneuvers. Yes, they strapped a 20mm naval gun onto a Ford.

"Despite the popular image of WW1 being a war where old donkeys led millions of young lions to their needless deaths because they were too dumb, too conservative, too British/French/German/Russian to adapt to change, reality was that WW1 generals were very innovative and adaptive. One could even argue that it was the general of WW2 and later wars who were *less* adaptive and innovative than a WW1 general, for these generals had the benefits of experiences, developed tech, advanced economy, and still make mistakes. I am looking at you, American generals who sent hundred of GIs to their early grave because they forgot IED was a thing and Humvee could do crap about it, despite the Vietnamese teaching them a very good lesson about IED thirty years prior.

But, I am ahead of myself. Back to WW1.

The thing about truck in WW1 was that it was new technology. For comparison, a truck with internal combustion engine appeared 18 years before WW1. It was a new, untested, unproved technology that was prohibitively expensive: the price of a Daimler Motor Lastwagen was 5,200 German Mark in 1896. Now my math may be off here, but according to Stephen Bull's *German machine guns of WW1*, when the German asked for a test Maxim gun in 1888, the price was 284 pounds per gun. From the best of my ability, I was able to find that in 1913, 1 British pound = 20 German Marks. So, a test machine gun was 5,600 marks, give or take (price may be lower as time goes on and production scale)

With such high price and unreliable tech, an army would be forgiven to ignore the trucks, especially when you had other more important things to take care of. Stuffs like, say, machine guns, which had proven murderously effective in the Russo-Japanese war. And yet, they invested heavily in truck. According to James M. Laux's *Truck in the West during the First world war*, during the 1912-1913 period the German factories could only produce 5,500 trucks in total; and yet when the German army invaded Belgium, it brought with it hundreds of trucks. Didn't seem like a lot of trucks until you realized a/even as few as 600 trucks represented 10% of all trucks produced in the entire of Germany in two years, b/the Germans had to spend a lot of money on other things to like building a navy or maintaining an army for two-front war. By the end of 1914, the German army had 5,000 trucks. The French growth was more spectacular: before the war, they had 220 trucks - by August 1914, they had 6,000 trucks. By 1916 when the Battle of Verdun happened, the French had a fleet of 3,500 trucks moving 50,000 tons of supplies and 90,000 men along the Sacred road *each week*. They produced so many trucks that if one truck broke down, they shoved it off the road. And this was France, a country whose entire coal region had been lost to the German in the Franco Prussian war, whose industrial heartland in the Northeast was by 1914 in German hand.

The military commanders of that time did not stop there. They saw through the backwardness of horses and immediately sought to replace those big foolish four-legged things wherever they could. Needed to pull a field gun? Why, the French produced some 8,600 trucks just to pull field gun. Got muddy terrain to go through? Holt Tractor company got you covered. Oh, your guns needed to hit the Kraut but private Johnny was too illiterate to make a precise shot from 1,000 meter away? Why, pack your gun onto your tractor, drive up there, and introduce the Kaiser to your 75mm gun. Putting guns on truck was how we get to tanks in the first place. Shooting down pesky zeppelin? Slap some guns onto your trucks! Fuck horses! Fuck cavalry too. Those guys are gay.

Given their lack of technology and past experience along with the modernity and, some may say, exoticness of the tech, the generals of WW1 embraced the truck heartedly, to the best of the ability of their country's economy.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZQWV3NUFXSF9kQ0liOFRYbzhPWldzTmpwcG9zdVRyVFNkYmVEUGNnZUZvbWZfc3ZQVi1iOGZYUGFoX1dkaWxaTDlJakdvS1Y3dFRMZGttVTZiU1Zhd0stNVBLRmRrbHRsODF0RndZYXNvUE09

"As I said it’s a figure I recall, not one I have to hand. 

CdG carries a C-13-3 steam catapult which can launch up to 27t, a fully fueled F-35C weighs 24.5t, so that’s 2.5t of ordnance,  more than enough for the internal weapons and some external ones as well. And the 27t figure is for Rafales, which at max weight have a higher wing loading and lower T/W ratio so likely the F-35C could be launched with even more. 

I agree the alterations weren’t a great idea in 2010 but that’s far behind when they should’ve made that choice (although the original design called for a steam catapult to be able to be added which never materialized). 

As for the conversion, it’s pre-decisional but it’s being looked at fairly seriously. And if you’d read the article you linked, it explicitly states a desire to be able to launch manned fixed wing aircraft, in fact citing the F-35C as an example.

>As I said it’s a figure I recall, not one I have to hand

You'll understand then that I don't believe your figure at all then.


>CdG carries a C-13-3 steam catapult which can launch up to 27t, a fully fueled F-35C weighs 24.5t, so that’s 2.5t of ordnance,  more than enough for the internal weapons and some external ones as well. And the 27t figure is for Rafales, which at max weight have a higher wing loading and lower T/W ratio so likely the F-35C could be launched with even more. 

A Rafale can't even take off with a full weapon load.


>I agree the alterations weren’t a great idea in 2010 but that’s far behind when they should’ve made that choice (although the original design called for a steam catapult to be able to be added which never materialized). 

The original design did not call for a steam catapult.



>As for the conversion, it’s pre-decisional but it’s being looked at fairly seriously. And if you’d read the article you linked, it explicitly states a desire to be able to launch manned fixed wing aircraft, in fact citing the F-35C as an example. So there’s some buyer’s remorse there clearly, and value seen in making that change even at this stage.

"Thank you! My intention is to give an update on my research here once I have successfully defended. I didn't want to show too much of my research in case it's accidentally picked up by the plagiarism software as a false positive. The fact that PhD students can share on-going research with the world is still not on the university's radar, I'm afraid. 

I don't have much material on the Punitive Expedition, because the journals were swamped with the analysis of WW1 in Europe, but cavalry officers noted repeatedly during and after the war that Mexico and Allenby's Palestine campaign proved the viability of horse cavalry and that it should be retained in addition to armor in the interwar period. We also need to remember that the 9th (or 10th?) Cavalry, despite not being sent overseas in WW1, gained valuable combat experience in the southwest of the United States in 1918 when they had multiple gun fights with bandits and Native war parties. What little I could found was basically a condemnation of the American logistics system during the Expedition while cavarly officers deflected any criticism of naysayers. 

Frankly, I think they had a point. Many military historians tend to judge with the benefit of hindsight or search retroactively for evidence why their school of thought is superior. I tried to go forward as much as possible and even while focusing on the potential of motorization and mechanization pre-WW1, cavalry officers had a point with keeping the horses. I think they had a point well into the interwar period and General John K. Herr, the last Chief of Cavalry, was unjustly branded a luddite when he noted in 1942 that horse cavalry still had a point on the battlefield. Maybe not in terms of cavalry divisions, but I think a company of horse recon per division could have been useful during the Italian campaign.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZNTU0MHAyWGp3VXNicnFQR0x5Vm1rbHplVEI4VGNCU2dPRHJzeXI0dDhlZkZzR1czTldnRmZZSDFQTlhURDNISG02ekhFNGttb2U5OE1iQWJFc2RBbFVSRjdBekJzQks1WlRUUmhHUlhpa2s9

"I think another key aspect is that there WERE massive formations in the beginning. In the original maneuver warfare we saw columns of vehicles pouring in. 

However, without air dominance or efficient logistics the stubborn Ukrainian defense turned this into a stalemate. 

But don’t put the cart before the horse!

A large reason we’re in a stalemate is BECAUSE neither side can field effective large formations. Neither side has the stamina, skill or air power to pull it off. That’s how we got here and why we will stay here.

It’s possible see large formations and maneuver warfare if one side was able to build up an excess of skilled penetration divisions with air power. But then we wouldn’t be in a stalemate.

I used to subscribe to the whole “drones see everything and that’s why you can’t do large formations” but I now believe that’s just a symptom of two sides who really can’t offensively dominate eachother, realize that and are stuck in this situation now where they need to expend the least amount of troops over time.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZejltU0hITnZlNHl3VnZNam9sVXdtYlZtaGtCcERzOHRDVlNUVVMxaGF5cWlxUHVuM3VWbG96UXlGNzZDTEZzbzFvNWlSNWxXc2FKZ3pOSFpQdjhwcWc9PQ==
Yes that was one big problem that required a skilled pilot. It was also very easy for torque drift on the flight deck to send aircraft off the side which is why its early service was mostly VMF squads as opposed to navy ones. The huge propeller only barely cleared the deck and wouldn’t have cleared at all without the gull wing; a propeller strike on a hard landing was quite possible. The pilot was far back compared to other aircraft and the taxiing characteristics really suffered because of how little the pilot could see over the long nose. It also leaked like a sieve and if you have ever seen a historical photo and noticed white lines over the engine and radiator panels that was surgical tape they used to try and keep liquids in the damn engine rather than leaking everywhere. In return though you get a plane called “Whistling Death” by enemies and in the hands of a skilled pilot like Pappy Boyington its a serious killing machine.,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcWxrbEF0RWlZZjNrVHJuXzVpSmlUcmc0dGpNN0FSOUZ6OWpBbDRIYUZqYlBQX1M1ZDMwMnpfSjlOZmZQcjU3THU5X0JleEUwczlhaWtJdFotWmtCeHc9PQ==

"The numbers I’ve seen for the actual per unit purchase cost for those shells ranged from 360k to 480k depending on batch. I’m *highly* skeptical that they’d reduce that by 90% or more even with scale. Part of the reason why is that this guided round was supposed to be a specialty round and a large majority of ammo would be cheaper rounds, mostly dumb 155, in the initial plan. When the order was cut by 40% we did see the cost rise to that 800k actual figure. It’s unlikely the munition was going to be reasonable cost because they were asking for a shell that basically was a missile.

For an imperfect comparison, the F-35 has had its unit cost reduced to about a third (from over 200mil to 80mil per depending on mods). In order to make the AGS ammo cost competitive they’d have had to achieve reductions like that twice which for a still fairly limited munition is questionable at best.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZN09iUjZWcnY0U29aU3ltemNBSGx2VnMwMmlEMnpyR0ZMZ2FzcXk4c3huanE2NDN5SWN2ZWxpNXdCX25ySW1nWnZJeldFcTdwUFkwbWF6LXpDaE9FWXV6UWNpTlE4Rm44bjRHX3ZDQWUzTUE9

The Army can't add positions in one place without subtracting them from another, and honestly AWG was probably low hanging fruit from the Army's perspective.

"It's something I'm pondering for my outlook chapter. Basically my research period ends with the entry into WW2 (the end of peacetime for the US Army) but I want to have one chapter that deals with the fallout of the decisions made throughout the 1930s and the fallout of the Fall of France. One of that is the full motorization of the Army,  second is the 90 division gamble, third is a firepower/airpower heavy approach. All in theory of course, but that's basically where things were heading with the various branches by the time the war starts.

By the Italian campaign I was specifically referring to the Apennines: 

[https://history.army.mil/brochures/nap/72-34.htm](https://history.army.mil/brochures/nap/72-34.htm) 

With motor vehicles often stuck in the mud, infantry on foot had to make up the difference. That's an issue throughout the European and Pacific theater: whenever the Army had to fight on foot casualties mounted and rifle companies were always hit really hard. Nothing new in itself, poor bloody infantry always picks up the tab in these situations. It's why pre-WW1 and interwar discourse are full with glorifications of noble infantry deaths: the honor goes to those who bleed. 

Despite the desire to fully motorize, the Army in Italy relied heavily on pack mules in this area just as armies had done for thouands of years. They are just incredibly versatile. I'm not deep into WW2 history despite my area of research, but I wonder if retaining a reconaissance company attached to every division could have helped in that terrain. It's the reason why some armed forces have held onto both mules and horses like the German mountain troops:

WW2 showed that armor was the inheritor of horse cavalry, ergo we need to go back and show how people were obstructionist. Same with historians criticizing the concept of infantry and cavalry tanks when the can-do-all MBT was an invention of the post-war period and you needed a mix of both tanks during the war depending on the situation.

They are tasked with liasing with local forces in a combat environment in order to accomplish some mission. In Vietnam, this was advizing the South Vietnamese. In Afghanistan after 9/11, Working with the Northern Coalition to attack the Taliban and call in airstrikes, depicted in the movie 12 strong.

Delta Forces mission sets are intentionally not disclosed. Interestingly it is rumored that Delta actively seeks out both men and women for their ranks. Hinting at a specialization in special reconnaissance. Kinda suspicious for a bunch of fit dudes to be staking out an HVTs home, but not for a man and wife to just be driving arround an area.

"*US Army Special Forces* are the ""Green Berets"", what you mean are ""special operation forces. To answer your question: different tasks, different development history. The US Army Special Forces were created as the spiritual successors of WW2 units: behind enemy line action, guerilla training, force multiplier. Delta was originally created as a hostage rescue unit. Rangers either as small scale long range recon or large scale raid forces, basically the heavy muscle of US Army SOF. In some regards there is of course an overlap and the War on Terror blurred the lines further.

"A couple of things are important to remember about trucks before WWI:

1.  The maintenance requirements were insane compared to today's vehicles.  Just check this manual from Ford:  https://www.cimorelli.com/mtdl/1920/1920omjun.pdf

2.  Trucks weren't that easy to operate.  There is a reason why ""driver"" was a specialty all the way through WWII.  The driver would be trained on how to drive and care for the truck in a way that would maximize longevity.  They needed to know how to operate the vehicle on different grad

3.  Trucks of the time simply weren't that rugged and couldn't haul that much weight on poor roads or off road.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZaUR1eld5OTBXTkFTRmt6VW9xY2tmdS1GNFZ4SGRPeGtVUTVYTlk2X0czRlhjb3VFUERCSE95SGJDbkw1RVdBR29OLVVZYWZoV2dUamh4eWlKRFJId19TbUNNUnpNRENUX0tqVmNiTEVueUU9
"There's a lot of great answers here, and I know I'm late, but I'd like to make an effort to gel everything together into a coherent overview. An understanding of not just ""what's happening"", but ""what the effects are"", the operational & strategic effects of this tactical phenomenon (everyone being crazy dispersed into tiny formations).

The first most important thing to understand is **Lanchester's Square Law**. It's [the observation](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-designer-s-notebook-kicking-butt-by-the-numbers-lanchester-s-laws) that the ""power"" of a fighting force tends to rise with the *square* of its size. So a force that's twice as large is actually 4 times as strong, not 2 times as you'd first expect. The simple intuitive explanation for this is that if you have twice as many men, you have twice as many ""hitpoints"" for your formation *and* twice as much firepower, so you're actually 4 times as strong. So if a force of 100 troops fight a force of 200, the 200 troops will not lose 100 men. They'll actually lose something like **27** -- roughly a quarter of the losses you'd first expect, because they have twice as much firepower, and twice as many men to spread the damage out over to make it less concentrated & lethal, so they take a quarter of the losses and get a 4:1 advantage over the enemy in terms of men lost they need to replace. That's a really powerful advantage!

*(Of course, things like differences in technology, tactics, leadership, weaponry, etc. can overcome this gap and let the smaller force beat the bigger one. The famously coveted ""force multiplier"". But when 2 forces have broadly the same everything -- same ex-Soviet technology, same ex-Soviet tactical manuals, same ex-Soviet officer corps, same ex-Soviet weaponry -- then there's not a lot of room to find an advantage over someone who's almost a clone of yourself.)*

The second most important thing to understand is that **Area of Effect/AoE weapons are really powerful and can kill these large formations stone dead**. If I take my 200 men against an artillery bombardment rather than an opposing force of 100 men, and say we're on the assault in the open so the artillery bombardment is super effective and practically everyone dies or gets wounded, then my 200 men are not a superweapon. They are just a ""super-target"". No matter how many (or how *few*) men I send into the artillery bombardment blender, everyone dies: whether that be 2 men, 20, 200, 2000, or 20 000. So there's **an opposing pressure to ignore Lanchester's Square Law and make my formation as small as possible**, disperse as much as possible. This is the famed ""Empty Battlefield"" phenomenon you're observing.

The third thing to remember is that **there are some things you can only deal with through numbers**. If I say need 50 men to clear a single path through a minefield, I need 50 men. I cannot send a force of 5 men and expect them to do it. I cannot send a force of 50 men either, not if the enemy is shooting back and they need to defend themselves. I can try sending a force of 100 men, but it's a bit dicey in the first place to rely on only a single path through the minefield; maybe I should try clearing 4 paths instead to have some redundancy. So now I need like 500 men for this operation: 200 to clear the minefield & 300 to guard them (plus guard the path through so it doesn't close). **That 500 has to be subtracted from anything I do going forwards**: e.g. if I have a force of 501 men, I can have the 500 conduct a ""breaching operation"" through the minefield... just to send 1 guy through. But if I have a force of 1000 men, I can have 500 conduct the breaching operation & send 500 through. And if I send in 10 000 men, I waste only 5% of my force on the breaching operation & can send 9500 troops through. But if I send 400 men, the breaching operation will fail. So there are some things that absolutely **demand** numbers, more is more efficient & less just won't work.

The fourth thing to remember is that **bigger forces are easier to spot.**

The fifth thing to remember is that **the deeper you go into enemy territory, the easier it is to be spotted**.

The sixth thing to remember is that **the deeper you go into enemy territory, the easier it is for the enemy to have laid down really thick minefields** & stuff, away from the reach of your artillery & drones & glide bombs & stuff. It's hard to lay even barbed wire on the frontline, as Kofman points out according to u/[Severe-Tea-455](https://www.reddit.com/user/Severe-Tea-455/), because you're constantly being watched & shot at even at night. But farther away from the frontlines, the easier it is to dig some *really* good fortifications.

All these things combine together into a picture of stagnation:

**1. I cannot send a large force because they instantly die** (to a first approximation). If they do somehow survive, the more successful they are & the deeper they plunge into enemy territory, the more likely they are to get spotted, get targetted by an artillery bombardment, and instantly die (or get critically wounded deep in enemy territory).

**2. I can send a small force, but they'll struggle to accomplish anything**. The small force is stealthier & surprisingly often gets ignored by enemy artillery as a waste of shells *(it's admittedly a morbid strategy to make your men's lives cheaper & more expendable than the enemy's artillery shells, but it works)*. However, once they slip through the enemy frontlines, they cannot do much of anything. They cannot outfight the large enemy forces surrounding them (on literally all sides), because of Lanchester's Square Law. They cannot try to slip deeper into enemy territory to try to hit lone targets like enemy officers or something, because they don't have the numbers to cut through barbed wire & breach through minefields.

* They *can* call in artillery fire, but the frontline enemy forces are deliberately so dispersed it's a waste to shell them *(just like your own frontline troops)*, and the backline enemy forces have had time & space to dig in & protect themselves against shells.
* They can also ""trench raid"" the enemy frontline, trying to beat small numbers with small numbers, but that just results in combat that's extremely ""slow"" because (a) even if the engagement wipes out the enemy trench, that's like a full day's worth of battle to cause like 5 enemy casualties *(small numbers vs. small numbers = small numbers dying)*, and (b) when the enemy just trench raids back, they recapture their trench, so we don't make much progress in taking ground either.
* My tiny forces are just extremely, extremely slow at both winning the attrition war/causing casualties, and winning the maneuver war/taking & *holding* ground.

(note: cut off due to character limit, continued in next post)",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZb1JSSDM2TFRIUmtSMnpTbG5WZUQ0NGdtdmNhVDBnN2o5Ymh4dzNxcnlONWt3T1F1ckNxV240eVZKQUI4U1JCR1MzV21feTl0cG5BY09jazRCRXVDVDNtWHRzMFBTbndrajdCZF9iRWxKYWM9
"Continued:

**3. The same is true for my opponent. Neither of us can do much of anything. So, stagnation.**

* i.e. It's an attritional war, but it's not even a fast one. It could have been a *""fast bloodbath""* where it's a matter of who can take the most losses, but it's over in weeks, rather than a *""slow bloodbath""* where it's a matter of who can take the most losses, but it's going to take years. But it isn't, because both sides can only send forth a tiny % of their forces at once, and so **only a tiny % can die each day**.
* It's going to take a lot of days to churn through the entire 100%, especially since **they keep ""healing"" back up** by calling up more troops + healing wounded troops up enough to get them back in the fight. They might have to churn through something more like 500% of the enemy's original ""health"", when only something like 0.5% are being wounded or killed per day, and because of the wounded eventually re-entering the fight, only something like 0.2% actually get killed or knocked out permanently per day. *(I don't actually know the exact numbers, but you get the gist. This is a drip-feed war.)*

**4.** What, fundamentally, can anyone do about this? How do we break the deadlock a la WW1 and get back to fast, maneuver instead of attrition/land-based instead of casualty-based warfare?

* **The most fundamental problem is that you cannot mass your forces on the frontlines**. If you could, a huge % of your force could fight at once, and the war would go faster. And they could also start breaching through things like minefields & barbed wire, so you could start threatening the enemy by getting behind them rather than grinding them down from the front. Since we cannot, we cannot have fast nor maneuver-based warfare.
* So what we need to do is to find a way to be able to amass forces on the frontlines without them dying near-instantly.
* That means breaking the lock enemy artillery has on your frontline forces. There's an entire ""kill chain"" you could target -- anything from the various enemy recon teams *(drones, men, satellites, civilian informants, recon planes, etc.)*, to the communication infrastructure relaying their targeting data to the artillery (*radio, cell phone, Starlink, telephone, fiber optic, etc.)* to the command & control systems deciding which targets to shoot vs. pass on *(officers to kill, computers to hack, and so on)* to the artillery systems themselves *(just blow them up)* to the logistics systems keeping the artillery supplied with shells to fire *(artillery is an absolute supply hog, that might actually be its biggest weakness)*. That was one of the things air power was good for in WW1 & 2, I understand: shooting down enemy recon blimps & planes + waging ""[Air Interdiction](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/article/0214air/)"" against those juicy backline targets.
* Or you could try to make your forces more resistant to artillery instead. That's one of the benefits of the invention of the tank in WW1: its armor makes it more resistant to artillery shrapnel (not immune, but better at surviving it), and armor also allows it to ignore bullets & just run forwards through No Man's Land, meaning it can dodge artillery bombardments by blitzing forward & simply not being there when the shells land.
* So is there any analogue we could deploy right now? Some way to break the artillery killchain, or just shrug off bombardments?
* Honestly, I don't know, I'm just a civilian. If I actually knew the answer, I'd probably be employed at DARPA, and also not be allowed to tell you it. All I can tell you is what history shows. What comes next is a much harder question, one I don't have the time to answer. Even writing just this took an absolutely huge amount of time I'm hard pressed to spare.
* It'll be fun to look back on this in a few years though, and see how right vs. wrong I was though about the answer to the deadlock. Maybe this will all just be resolved through Ukranian special forces teams assaulting the Kremlin, or something, and the artillery deadlock will be completely irrelevant to how the war ends. Wouldn't be the weirdest thing that's happened in history.

Edit: **TL;DR: Artillery.** It's a slow, grinding killer if your enemy just drip-feeds in their forces, and it's a mostly static weapon as well. And if the slow, grindy, mostly static weapon is the strongest thing on the battlefield... then the war is also going to be slow, grindy, and mostly static.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZbVVCTE1hUWxlV3FBWUd5RDJianFEa1BXcFFXbXlRd3pQZG95MHhyYTh3WnFIdGRmaWowa2pJQzFzQmxzRGRIVkxjb0wtYS1ONXBVQU8yc2liVk9tX25aUVk3WmJ0ZDRmQm5VbElFOG9aanc9

"The US uses it all the time, if you consider missiles. If we are speaking strictly gunfire, then naval guns are very useful depending on conditions. For example, to continue with the US as an example, when US Marines were deployed to coastal zones to conduct operations such as non-combatant evacuations in Liberia or peacekeeping in Lebanon, naval gunfire was a cost-effective and responsive way to give the shore units fire support without putting big guns on the ground. I believe naval gunfire was used by the US Navy and Marines in Lebanon. 

As has been mentioned by others, the difficulty of traditional naval gunfire is getting it close enough to shore in the modern hostile environment, where the shore will be defended by long range missiles, aircraft, and other ships. 

But I would say in operations other than full-scale war, traditional naval gunfire is still quite useful.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZY0g2NmZWU0FzNm9hZjhXOHM0eWdQbTNBcUlLcks5RTlzU2dRMUZsTTFUdE9yUVpxS2QtNXVKNzBYT3ZfVmNsQzgyNW1TNkpubG1zZWw1eC1VSHA5V1E9PQ==
"Around 1945-1946 when the Viet Minh National Defense Force was formed, they’d mostly have [Berthiers that were leftovers of the Tirailleur Indochinois](https://flic.kr/p/2mtHjFw). Ho Chi Minh had the “gold week” fundraiser to purchase weapons from the Nationalist Chinese handling the surrender of Japanese troops. Not only were Japanese weapons purchased, but also (according to Bernard Fall) “brand new American lend-lease”. This may explain some Thompsons and [M1 Carbines](https://flic.kr/p/2jdR3EV) seen in 1946, as I believe only a small batch of carbines were dropped by the OSS the years prior.

Another rifle would be the M1917 Enfield, which was the most common rifle used by the French early on until they got sufficient numbers of MAS 36s. Aside from capturing them from the French, there may be a possibility that some were purchased from corrupt Chinese as mentioned above.

Viet Minh security forces reportedly encountered automatic fire when they raided the Vietnamese Nationalist headquarters at On Nhu Hau, so they likely also captured SMGs or LMGs from there too, though I don’t know what kind in particular. What their Viet Quoc opponents were equipped with is an even greater mystery.

There were 23,000 Berthier 1902 sent to Indochina, and they were split to Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia.

"The main sources for weapons during the early years of the war, apart from traditional hunting weaponry, were the French, the Japanese, and the OSS/Nationalist Chinese. French equipment largely came from the Indochinese soldiery - whether by defection or capture/death of the original owner, though some was also gained from the Japanese after these disarmed and interned the French garrison of Indochina. 

Although Japan surrendered in August 1945, the Japanese Army was left in place to maintain order until things could be ""sorted out"", during which time many Japanese troops either gave their weaponry to the fledgling VM army, or let them take it. In some cases, Japanese officers and men not only gave their weaponry to the local VM, but also provided training in the use and maintenance of said equipment. The motivation here seems to be a general Japanese antipathy to the return of Western hegemony to Asia. American material, via OSS or Nationalist China, was probably a less important source, but still welcomed by the early rebels. With the mass surrender of many Indochinese garrisons (including that of the Palace of Representatives in Hanoi, who yielded 200 carbines and a large supply of grenades), together with the donation of equipment by the retreating Japanese forces (including a windfall for the VM when a stock of weaponry - much originally intended for China, but which had been held at Haiphong by the French in 1940 - was handed over by the Japanese. This included numbers of AA guns, AT guns, and Russian 7.62mm rifles with AT rounds), by the end of 1945 estimates of weaponry in VM hands included:

* 35,000 small-arms (rifles, SMGs, carbines, pistols, etc.)
* 1,350 LMGs
* 200 mortars
* 54 artillery pieces (of various types)

Weapons were then supplemented through looting French arsenals or self-production in rudimentary weapons factories (although, surprisingly, it includes some very formidable weapons like bazookas and anti-blockhouse recoilless guns). Meanwhile, military aid from China only began in 1950, and in 1953 with the Soviet Union.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZZTY5NHZNZDhRUkhGSk1MYS15ZWtvV01OeUMwVlEwQkRmc1h1SXdOeHEwdHpkUm13dnM0ZkMtalJhNmRVM1lCUnQ2c2dBSmg0Q1ZFSjFyQnhxUVcyWkE9PQ==

"Simply put: you don't.

In the time of total war, a *democracy* is the last thing you need, for how can you expect the dumb, hungry, foolish masses to see beyond their lives, their struggles, their hardships, their morality for the grander picture? How can you expect the squabbling politicians, each only interested in themselves, many were in league with outside forces, to fight for their nation? The famous example would be the Roman: there was a reason why the Roman had the post ""dictator"" because they knew in time of crisis they could not let decisions be handled by the masses, but by a clear and firm leader. When the 2nd Punic War happened, only Fabius Maximus was level-headed enough to realize scorched-earth tactic was the only way to stop Hannibal. But the stupid masses did not see it, called him name, elected two idiotic hotheads to replace him after his term was over: Gnaeus Servilius Geminus and Marcus Atilius Regulus. If these two names were familiar while yes, these were the two idiots who led the Roman to their worst defeat at Cannae, simply because the masses begged them too.

Just look at France in WW2 and how they bungled the 1940 invasion of France. After that, the Right was more than happy to lick Hitler's butt while the Left refused to resist Hitler because Hitler was friend to the Soviet Union and it was only until Stalin and Hitler traded blow did they begin to resist. Oh, and [they also sold out their fellow French resistance members to the Nazis.](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-10-25-mn-14198-story.html) People often talked about how the US had a democracy during WW2, forgetting the fact that the US was the least damaged nation of World War 2. They also conveniently ignored the part that the FBI was given free reign to deal with ""domestic enemies"": The agency size went from [2,400 in 1940 to a whopping 13,000 in 1944](https://www.fbi.gov/history/brief-history/world-war-cold-war). And the FBI was not the only spook in town: There was the [Office of Naval Intelligence](https://irp.fas.org/ops/ci/docs/ci2/2ch1_a.htm) who was also allowed ""to conduct personnel security inquiries, sabotage, espionage, and countersubversion cases, examine Japanese activities in the United States, and investigate war fraud matters."" Did I mention the US government also [hire the Mafia to help them out?](https://ncisahistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Naval-Intelligence-and-the-Mafia-in-World-War-II.pdf) And established registry of German, Italian, and Japanese people? And interning Japanese and Germans? Terribly undemocratic, no?

And we are seeing the effect of having a free democracy right now in the Ukraine war: The Russian had lost hundreds of thousands of men, thousands of pieces of materials, had all of their preliminary war-time aims denied, and yet they are still pressing on. Meanwhile the Americans have yet to lose a single soldier, have only supplied Ukraine with bare minimum weapons and training (which was way way way less than what North Vietnam received by the ComBloc in the Vietnam war), and yet the American public are wary of this war. Why? Because they have a free democracy where the loud masses have a chance to moan. Instead of seeing that this is the very best chance to knock down their traditional enemy for good with no cost to themselves and secure the US dominance as well as their children's security, they only see whispers of World war 3 whipped up by TikTok and Twitter.

So no, in a major war, you don't maintain your democracy. You make sure everyone shut up and united for the goal. That was how the Japanese proved so resilient, how the Vietnamese were abled to duke it out with the French and later the US. Ho Chi Minh put it best:

The last parliamentary elections were held there in 1936. Paul Reynaud became the head of government in March 1940 (Churchill in May 1940).

"Agreed. A lot of what you said is also part of how we lost mainland China to the Communists. Rather than finishing off the Communists, we initially discharged many soldiers (as desired by America), who promptly joined the Communists to continue getting paid. Then, despite still putting the Communists on the ropes in the Northeast, we stopped an offensive rather than finishing them off to appease America, but then Truman withheld promised aid anyways, so our morale collapsed, and the Communists got the break they needed to get more supplies from the Soviet Union and finally turn the tide.

China becoming Communist led to North Korea and North Vietnam and many other Asian Communist movements gaining so much power and generally scoring a winning record during the Cold War.

"Yes but the point is that was the per unit cost actually incurred. The comparison with the F-35 is poor because there were almost certainly hundreds of billions in terms of fixed costs from R&D and the figures referencing trillions are when talking about *program lifetime cost*. That’s operations, maintenance, upgrades, R&D, etc. That’s not at play here.

Even if producing at 10x the scale, the USN would still have been placing orders in the high hundreds to low thousands at a time. For munitions, particularly the high end ones, that is still near artisan levels of production. You might be talking 5 shells per day. 

Producing long range, guided 6in shells at that rate was always going to be incredibly expensive per unit.

Cotton works for flame resistance but doesn't function to provide warmth if wet, becomes heavy when soaked, and doesn't breathe as well as synthetics used as base layers.

"How are the program lifetime costs not at play? The R&D and cost of setting up a factory being factored into the cost of the shells is the exact thing that made the cost skyrocket.

The Navy would have had to buy around 1800 shells per ship to stock the magazines. There were no other rounds available. LRLAP was the only round designed for the 155mm AGS. Other 155 ammo wouldn’t fit in the chamber right, and the barrels were rifled differently than regular 155mm guns. So while the army wouldn’t necessarily want to order a lot of M982 rounds because it has other options, the navy would want a lot of LRLAP rounds because the alternative is a tomahawk.

So, at 1800 X 32 ships, that’s 60,000 shells, at least. I’d also assume that the navy would want to build up a strategic stockpile for their 32 ships, so that they could replenish after a mission. Even just doubling it so that every ship can reload fully once is 120k shells.

When the Zumwalt program got cut to 3 ships, that number shrank to 6,000-12,000 shells. Spreading the program cost over 6,000 shells is an order of magnitude more money per shell.

Do you know what’s an order of magnitude more than the $35,000 quoted in 2004? $360-480k, which was from around 2009, after the Zumwalts had been cut to 3 ships. And then by the time the LRLAP program was cancelled in 2016 the cost had gone up to $800k-$1.2m, which was in part due to the inflation from the 09 recession but also additional program costs.

It’s not a 1:1 comparison, but M982 also has a low production rate, and by 2016 the unit cost was $68k after an initial unit cost of $250k. And that program had its own brush with cancellation after a similarly drastic cut in orders by the Army, but unlike LRLAP the M982 program was saved.

Again, I’m not saying $35k was realistic. I think $100k in 2004 was probably closer, but I also think that procurement of 120,000 shells and a consistent expenditure and stockpiling would have kept the price per round more reasonable.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZM0FNWFhadUFGTldnSzNsdk15TnNYUzh1R09mM21DR3dEVzdlcjdFeml0TlpOVXoyNEZTcEZDbk9fNE9YWFQyZkQwZTVlYjE2bmJFa1Q4aFhlaS05U1E9PQ==

If you had effective ISR and counter-battery fire, these M101 wouldn't survive for a day. This also applies for all the artillery systems which are employed statically. 


The narrative of omnipresent ISR also ignores all the possible, but usually not applied countermeasures such as smoke shells, dispersion vs. massing of forces etc. and especially coordinating and integrating all effects in order to mitigate the effect of UAV.

"""ending a war"" is a broad statement but certainly stuff have made huge differences.

The radar-based VT Proximity Fuse was absolutely a huge deal in WW2, it represented a major technological boost and it allowed Allied warships to have a *significant* boost in AAW and protecting both their own ships and the Fast Carrier Task Forces / Convoys /etc.  Before it was just ""fill the sky with bullets of several ascending sizes and hope that the sight-thingies work and a plane runs into a bullet...""  The VT allowed them *much more likely a chance* of actually kabooming a plane.

Condensed Milk was a crucial and critical part of the Union Army rationing, and you might not thing of a foodstuff as a ""secret weapon"" but the Confederates had *much less* ration resources than the Union ... so they were almost *always* at a (potentially severe) disadvantage ... can only live so long on Chicory Coffee ... Advances in both food preservation & the Union's ability to provision it's forces and the South's almost total lack of said ability, definitely a ""secret weapon"" ...

You might make the argument that Chobham Armor was a secret weapon in the Desert Storm /Gulf War ... the Brits (like with VT) knew they had something very special, and the US got it but never deployed it (on the M1 Abrams MBT) until then... and it completely and totally romped on Iraq... we could kamboom them but they almost totally could not kaboom us.  That was pretty much what Hitler always wanted ... a tank that was impervious to enemies but could destroy them at will.  If the ""secret"" of that is Composite Armor, I'd certainly call that a ""secret weapon"" ...

"I phrased that poorly, my apologies. My point is that it was in fact the per unit cost of the shells, not the entire program cost being divided over those shells. Some fixed costs were being recouped of course, but when they purchased ammo, it was in fact that price. It's not the entire R&D of the gun being divided over it or projected lifetime cost the way F-35 critics talk about things.

>The Navy would have had to buy around 1800 shells per ship to stock the magazines. There were no other rounds available. LRLAP was the only round designed for the 155mm AGS. Other 155 ammo wouldn’t fit in the chamber right, and the barrels were rifled differently than regular 155mm guns. So while the army wouldn’t necessarily want to order a lot of M982 rounds because it has other options, the navy would want a lot of LRLAP rounds because the alternative is a tomahawk.

This ignores the fact that there was initially the idea of a ""dumber"" round but that got dropped because of engineering issues (and because the USMC want that for fire support but also wouldn't share budget, particularly once the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq got going). Tomahawks aren't the only other option either. Aviation is and for most cases is more than practical than a 155mm shell.

>So, at 1800 X 32 ships, that’s 60,000 shells, at least. I’d also assume that the navy would want to build up a strategic stockpile for their 32 ships, so that they could replenish after a mission. Even just doubling it so that every ship can reload fully once is 120k shells.

The original requirements were for only 600 per ship, a third of what you're assuming. Even *if* we are going with that full magazine, you'd still have slow production rates. Not sure where you're getting 1800 from as declassified docs for DDG 1000 showed 1200 rounds per ship.

Given the state of US shipbuilding, it would be quite impressive if they produced a Zumwalt every 6 months and built them all in 16 years but we will assume that so that we can get the most rounds per year. Going off that 600 per ship in the specifications, to stock them all you'd need 1200 rounds per year minimum or a little over 3 per day. Even if we went to filling magazines immediately at launch, you're talking 10 per day. That's not mass production. That's still quite the artisanal scale. Even if you want to assume things go up to 12 per day to account for use, that's still small and room for economies of scale are limited. It's unlikely the ships would be built that fast or launch with full magazines either. Assuming 120k shells would have been purchased is beyond wishful thinking and even *if* purchased would have been over decades, likely close to 30 years.

Getting even to 100k per round was always going to be challenge even if they built far more rounds than the USN ever needed. Remember that the order of 7500 M982s was a per unit cost of 260k despite being a less capable round with less than a third

Which gets to the practical point, it was more or less doomed from the start as the USN wasn't going to purchase and use that many rounds. The payload of ~10 kilos is pretty anemic compared to what the carrier wing can drop or a cruise missile like the Tomahawk. How many shore targets can a destroyer get within 90miles of safely, is tolerant of the greater inaccuracy compared to a JDAM or Tomahawk, and be destroyed by a warhead a fraction of the size? For the realities the US faced from 2003 onward, the program was doomed.

 Similarly, if there is no other way to accomplish a military objective. For instance, if you built churches around the entity of a military base, there would be no choice but to attack some of them to get through.

So the main thing that changes is whether both sides are obeying the Geneva convention and other international laws. If both are, then churches should be neither used for military purposes or intentionally targeted. Once one side does not care, it quickly becomes a situation where they have very limited protection.

Also, it's important to note there is no real international enforcement agency to the laws of war. If a major country decides not to follow them and no one else is able/willing to enforce them then nothing really happens.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZzl1THctakRtc0tIbjJpaHYtZERuNkN2MW5pS3dpcDV6OW5TSGV4X3RxSzVBNGFHVDRwQ3ZtbTBCcDROTkhsMTFrOHdWcXUyQ1RoRkQwNU10eTlMS1E9PQ==

"> That's also partially why I brought up Mitchell Institute. They lean more towards the aggressive use of 5th generation aircraft and PGMs (like for example their models of PGM usage in a peer war), which serves as an effective rhetorical counterargument towards OP.

They simply don't know what they know, and referencing publicly stated kill ratios (which C.W. Lemoine recently did a video [explaining how exercises are set up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHbniKeMUX0) which should give you a good idea of why you should question these claims) really hurts their argument. Especially when the [Raptor in 2006](https://www.f-16.net/f-22-news-article1916.html) allegedly had a 108-to-0 kill ratio at Northern Edge (which is every bit the equal of Red Flag, and then some) 

So if 5th gen in 2006 had a 108-0 kill ratio, and the F-35 is being advertised in 2017 as having a 15-1 or 20-1 kill ratio, what happened to the adversary aircraft in the span of 10 years? Especially when you hear people saying how the F-35 is better than the F-22 now?

What's the real number now in 2024? If you believe those numbers and that trendline, things haven't been going well, right?

Like I said, the Air Force knows significantly more about actual performance and how systems perform when paired with other systems than individual stats

I'll have to find the video, but the last Chief of Naval Operations, ADM Gilday, in sworn testimony in front of Congress stated that the Navy has found more success pairing 4th and 5th gen together than just using one or the other.

The earth is not a perfect sphere, but an oblate spheroid, which means that mathematically you need a different model to represent the shape of the earth. 

Some models are really accurate in one part of the planet, but useless elsewhere. For example, maps in the UK usually use the Ordnance Survey of 1936, which is itself based on the Airy 1830 ellipsoid. No one outside the UK uses OSGB36, because your grids would be wildly off.

The US military typically uses a datum that works worldwide called WGS84. However, when you deploy you might be using host-nation maps that use a different datum.

"For all of that, armies did march by foot and, mostly, by road (but not always) whenever they could, usually because they were more efficient and harder to get lost in, but also to help facilitate the movement of the baggage train, which more often than not consisted of slow moving wagons and carts carrying provisions and other supplies, unless you're relying solely on the pack animals themselves, but you won't be able to bring as much along.

It really depends on the era and place, of course, but roads back then were typically far poorer than what we have now, at least for walking. Even postmodern sidewalks, if you have those in your locality, are at least paved and are unlikely to turn to muck if it rains, but not always. I'm currently in Nam for vacation and there are many old roads which are unattended to, such that whenever it rains, you see pools and quagmires of mud, and these are harder asphalt roads, mind you, just not maintained whatsoever.

Maintenance was likely far more difficult and sparse back then than today. You see people refurbishing the roads quite a few times in the States, at least. However, back then, even in such a vast empire as that of the Romans, you'd be unlikely to see nearly as much care and frequency taken to road maintenance unless an army needs to march through it, which they sometimes repair along the way or even prepare a new road entirely.

If obstacles had fallen upon the road, there were men specifically tasked to move in advance of the army, spot them, report of said obstacles, and remove them if it was practicable before the army got there. Just so, there are also scouts who range ahead to discover various roads, settlements, suitable camping sites, enemy positions, etc. Quite a lot of times, especially in antiquity, a general might even ride out to conduct a personal reconnaissance and ascertain the lay of the land.

Note that crops are usually sewn closer to settlements, and they are not the same sprawling fields as you would see in the postmodern era, because there is a limit to what you can do without today's amenities and advanced technologies. So, the fields were likely smaller and were not present everywhere, and the crop yields were even lower than nowadays, which means that a field produced far less food for the people to eat, even when the crops are ripe.

It is therefore common sense to encamp not too far from settlements where there were a goodly number of fields, with which to draw forage from. Armies might even quarter themselves in multiple settlements or a single one if it can host their numbers. However, this might alienate the local populace and, so, there were generals who opted to encamp outside urban centers and in the hinterlands instead.

Naturally, soldiers are people and like close comforts, but getting them used to the tough military life is part and parcel with being a good general. You want to reward your soldiers for achieving their tasks and following your orders, but not spoil them with the creature comforts available to the ordinary citizenry. They will have to endure much hardship and toil; there might never be those who grow fully accustomed to it, but they would at best be made to suck it up.

On the matter of whether or not the locals will let you pass through. In a lot of cases, they did not have a choice, but let's say that a particular polity or people will be troublesome to contend with if they turn hostile. You can try to open negotiations with them and seek permission to pass through, with promises that your troops will be on your best behavior. Ideally, you would want to encamp outside the cities to prevent your soldiers from hassling the locals, as aforementioned.

Furthermore, rather than just taking your forage by wanton looting, you might opt to pay for it by means of money you brought in the baggage, and this must be secured most tightly and entrusted to your most loyal men. Now, foraging is not what most think it is. True, it does at times entail going into the wild and hunting or picking up foodstuffs available there, but nature alone does not produce in abundance as much as the fields of man.

Therefore, a lot of times, foraging as it were, was a fancy term for farm raiding and pillaging, taking from local grain depots and stealing from local homes what wheat, grain, and flour they have. This may also include, but is not limited to animals fit for slaughter, which may be procured as meat. Soldiers might even be tasked to find draft animals to pull the wagons or carry supplies. Tools and various miscellaneous objects like boats might be taken and carted for transport across rivers or for the pontoon train, which is for building floating bridges using rows of boats as their foundation, if there are not good fords or sturdy bridges already present to cross a river.

Naturally, all of these may also be procured by purchasing it rather than stealing it. Furthermore, if you are moving through the lands of a conquered people or vassal, rather than taking your tribute in money, you may take it in kind and other such necessities as I have mentioned above. Naturally, the same may happen in your own lands to and there are those who commit just as much harm on their own people to suit their interests or what they consider the interests of the state.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNllhdkFlWWpuOUVibVRIQVM5aGdZQXlza0RxOTdMeTd6elpRb0sxdWI2NEhNaDdPMzQ2TG9RSEg2WEJaUlNubkFJcmJha0M2TFBWc0JDdnZ5aUVjV1E9PQ==
"You can still do a decent amount of fighting with a platoon of BTRs' 14.5mm HMGs (and 7.62MMGs). Not something you want to get all that close with, but you have enough protection from rifles and MMGs, particularly when being used at distance to provide supporting fire. Clearly less capable in support than a BMP, particularly the BMP-2 which had a main gun that was actually useful, but still something that can support the infantry in a pinch, particularly if you're working with tanks.

Though it's after the USSR, it is interesting to see the BTR-82A approach of giving it a bit better armor and a 30mm gun. Still not as protected as your standard IFV, but I guess the logic is that it can be an ersatz-IFV if given the armament of one. I mean, I guess I'd rather have a 30mm gun supporting me even if the vehicle itself is still a bit more vulnerable and might be fighting from further distances.

As an aside, absolutely weird to me how the BTR-80 is heavier a BMP-1 and about the same as a BMP-2...",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaUVV4X04wQzFBV04zNVBQZ2VxZEdMQUN4eHU4el9LV3E5X1htNlNVeTJRRmRFTk1WaVRvSWowSzN5M1dPOVJMOFRNcGhIZzcyams3MlRuOUVnMXdBRWFvQmFZbkZCeUhiOHBkVE5rUmFJazA9
"In order prevent these burdens from affecting the locals, many generals therefore relied upon slow moving wagons coming afar from their homelands. In order to provide pit stops and resting stations for these supply convoys, deals may be worked out with local settlements to quarter them. If not, tactical bases in the form of old encampments might be left behind and garrisoned in order to receive the convoys, offering them some respite. Supplies may be stored in these bases for future usage and we call these ""magazines"" or supply depots.

Contrary to popular belief, Napoleon for instance, did not rely solely on forage, but also on these established supply lines. This way, he could optimally provision his army without relying on either as a crutch. If necessary, he may cut himself from his own supply lines and bases in order to rely on forage instead, lightening the burden of his army and allowing them to conduct swift marches in their operations. Light carts or just the pack animals themselves may still follow up as part of a more mobile baggage train.

Back on the matter of roads, most have the misconception that it was not until the corps system that armies moved divided, but this is not true. We know that various powers did it in medieval times, but also in antiquity based on some sources. If the roads were available, there were certainly advantages in doing so, as moving along separate roads prevents mass traffic from holding up the rear columns, which may be strung out on the march and more endangered by ambuscades.

By separating the marching paths, one also opens new avenues for supply convoys to travel through, such that if any were to be cut off and harassed by the enemy, then one column of the army may rely on the neighbouring columns moving by other roads for victual, and they may share their provisions when needed, rather than putting all their eggs in one basket along a single route.

Furthermore, by diversifying the routes, forage becomes easier on the army and the local populace, as rather than relying only on the towns along a single road to provision the entire army, the individual columns may take supplies from various neighbourhoods on multiple separate roads, reducing the burden of any one locality. This also makes it harder for the enemy to conduct scorched earth, for they will have to do more harm to their peoples to deny the attacker provisions by scourging a greater number of areas.

We may often be surprised to know how their coordinated these various moving columns using just horseback messengers, but there were also other methods available for communication. Signals fires, for instance, could be lighted and may serve to relay information about the whereabouts of one column relative to the other or call upon an ally for aid. The French in Napoleon's time had a sort of rudimentary telegraph system where they used code instead of spoken word in order to relay information.

The operations which some generals conducted may even be several hundred miles wide in terms of the localities which these columns may traverse through, and this was done even prior to the postmodern era or the invention of the telegraph as we know it. Of course, one must always be careful to conduct thorough reconnaissance to make sure that the enemy cannot fall in these detachments separately and defeat them in detail.

Aside from provisioning the men in terms of foodstuffs and attending to the movement of those supplies, generals must also take procuring drinking water into account. Saltwater is absolutely a no go and only freshwater can be utilized to quench the thirst of the troops. Thankfully, most settlements and crop fields are nearby bodies of water of some sort, whether they be streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, springs, or wells.

Now, more still bodies of water such as ponds, small lakes, springs, and wells may be poisoned in order to deny water sources to an opposing party, but it is much more difficult to do so to bodies of running water, which gradually filter out waste, such as a stream or river. You will require a mass amount of pollution to dirty them and make them hazardous to drink, should the waters be properly boiled.

Of course, armies can be massive at times and often produce a great quantity of human and animal excrement. These have to be disposed of somewhere and latrines were often dug with canals channeling the waste into nearby flowing bodies of water if not dug in landfills. In that case, it might be better to encamp upriver of an enemy, so that one's own waste flows downriver towards their camp and pollutes their sources of drinking and bathing water.

Furthermore, one can induce dysentery upon the opposition by flooding their camp, which will wash out what waste they have amassed on land into the abodes of their soldiers, infecting them with disease if not spoiling their dry foodstuffs which are not well stored. Water sources may also be dammed or diverted in order to prevent the enemy from receiving them. Conversely, if one seeks to obtain water and there is no visible body to be found, they may have recourse to dig for springs and create wells of their own.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaOE1Bd3otRk9ZTE02LXhuSUFwTm94d1pLSUc4Y3hpd2djUzFBS1Rfajl6NTNjcFAtLXhJZWJETG9NS1pibl9sNmgzZHNUZ1dWNTJIV1JZU2hGOGV4Rnc9PQ==

"When traversing bodies of water, there are numerous methods. First is to find suitable fords shallow enough to cross over with the army. Second is to procure boats to row the army across. Third is to establish a pontoon bridge made up of boats chained together in a row to the other bank, facilitating one's crossing. Fourth is a method given by Alexandros, where tents of hide are filled with hay and then sewn shut, whereupon they may be utilized as floating platforms or makeshift rafts to transport the men.

The fifth method, which Caesar used, was to dig canals into the side of the river to channel and reduce its water level. When it is deemed practicable to cross, the cavalry should be sent in first and line up parallel to one another to act as makeshift ""guardrails."" In this manner, the infantry and baggage may cross in between while the horsemen screened them from the flowing waters on one side and acted as lifeguards to catch any who slipped and fell on the other.

In choosing encampments, it is good to look for places with natural high ground and eminences like a hill or ridge, perhaps surrounded by rivers running through its front or flanks. Forests should be close by with which to procure firewood and for construction purposes, but should not be so near the camp as to be a staging point for ambuscades. Therefore, woodlands should be cleared away for up to several hundred yards.

The same applies for swamps and marshlands, which may serve to screen the camp and inhibit the enemy's advance, but must not be too close as to induce disease from swarming insects or to act as zones where the enemy might have recourse to hide ambush detachments in. Of course, not every camp site will be perfect or have these features available, so one must make due with what they get.

If encamping within narrow forest defiles, they should ideally clear the surrounding woodlands in the manner stated above. Felled branches might be used for stakes defending the camp perimeter, while fallen logs can serve as abatis and it is not a bad idea whatsoever to entrench the camp, establish an earthen and wooden rampart, and construct palisades with which to defend it.

If in a mountainous defile, then especial care should be taken to the rear of the camp, where ambuscades are likely, but also the flanks, where hidden routes and caverns may host the enemy, who often await to fall on a moving column or resting camp when one least suspects it. If the ground is suitable and there are no nearby visible bodies of water, mountainous terrain may have hidden reservoirs of water underground and digging for wells more be worth the while and keep the men busy.

In a swamp, the troops must make do with what dry patches of land are available and endure. If they can, they may mount animals to rest on them, and as grim as it is, even the bodies of the dead may serve as dry platforms to find respite on. These hardships Hannibal and his men endured in their crossing of the Arno River Marshlands. One cannot clear and drain a swamp as easily as a regular woodland, so especial care must be taken not to let the army rest on its laurels entirely, but remain vigilance.

Deserts are not ideal to encamp upon. The risks are far too great for scarcity of water, but also the threat of sandstorms. It is better to follow the course of rivers and settlements when traversing such arid landscapes and keep as far away from the dunes as possible. If one must travel through those areas, then they best pack light provisions and utilize them for swift manoeuvres only. They must also be knowledgeable of local springs and oases with which to temporarily encamp if possible.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaLXA4aE1JclA2NEt4NXozSXE0c0x5THRzYW9ZRmdrOWczOE5mS19qS19SOFJ6U3A4a0NaOVI3aXk4ZFV2aTkwc05nV1VuQjhkM3dKTVBZb2cxNW1sY1E9PQ==

"Yes.  Art is commonly known for portraying events literally as it happens.  In fact, the Chinese had a literal battalion of artists, all linked as a hive mind in order to paint the battle in real time. 

The fatality rate from psy-burnout was almost complete.

Or to a point, art is not a realistic portrayal of events.  It may strive to capture the emotions or feeling of the event, but even in fairly photo realistic looking paintings, subjects and elements portrayed are rarely 1:1 and often have if not intentionally symbolic placement, then have been placed or portrayed in ways to maximize the kind of mechanical components of drawing and art.

"In regards to preventing desertion, this is why flank guards and rearguards are set, with more trusted men tasked with handling their defense on the march and to screen against enemy ambuscades. However, it is also useful in catching individual deserters, whose presence will not be easy to miss with the eyes of hundreds unless a general is particularly despised and his men willfully ignore such things. Just so, watches in the camp serve similar purposes.

Establishing trust and good rapport with the men is the best preventative measure for dealing with desertion. A general should be stern, but not too harsh. He should not punish every little thing, but ignore the minor offenses while he can and only single out those offensives which are of the most grave danger to the army and state.

Harsh punishments should be avoided and it is better to use the carrot than the stick when dealing with men. Soldiers are our fellow humans, and the great captains have shown us that it is better to deal with them humanely rather than as beasts of burden to be whipped. Just so, it is better to be loved and respected than hated and feared.

When it is possible, avoid punishing the whole for the crimes of the few, but seek the gravest offenders and utilize them as a brutal example of what awaits the masses should they seek to subvert the supreme authority of the general. As aforementioned though, the crime should not be some petty or trifling matter, but only for those of utmost importance.

Before berating the men, it is better to take into account the reasons for their dissatisfaction and, if time is available, open a discourse with them in an assembly. Address their problems and make promises to do your utmost in fulfilling them. Alas, being a general requires some politicking skills, so you might have to make faux promises or those which cannot be immediately fulfilled.

Offer enticements to meritorious service. The minimum is letting the soldiers know and feel that they are taken care of, but rewards for good service should go beyond mere medals or titles. They should ideally be things which the soldiers might have want of or need. One cannot often go wrong with monetary benefits, but there are other cases in which the general should be adapted towards handling, which may be of more personal matters for the individual men.

For various examples, when Scipio found out that one of his men was routinely abandoning his post to go to town, he went among the soldiers and first got an account of that individual, whereupon he found out that, aside from skirting his post, he was mostly a brave man and distinguished in service.

He also came to discover that there was a woman who that soldier had fancied and that was why he routinely betook of himself to leave the army and meet up with her. Therefore, Scipio went to town and took the woman into the camp, then called up that soldier to convene with him.

Though the soldier suspected punishment, he was instead presented with his secret lover that he may keep her by his side. Scipio said that, through these measures, he hoped to see whether the soldier's love was true or whether he had subverted his duties for some baser purpose. Therefore, this served as both a means to keep the man close to his task while also acting as a test of his true loyalties and intentions.

When some men under Pompeius had discovered some treasure hidden by the shores of Carthage, rumour spread that there were numerous treasures further underground which were buried away when the Carthaginians were threatened by the Romans in ages past. The soldiers then went on a mad frenzy, abandoning the camp and digging for the supposed treasures.

Though they completely refused to follow orders, Pompeius did not punish them, but went about joking and laughing at their expense when the lot failed to find anything at all. He then pardoned them of punishment for their insubordination, stating that their worthless toiling which bore no fruit was punishment enough.

When Caesar's veterans requested that they be decimated (that every tenth man be executed) for failing him in battle against Pompeius, he refused their requests for punishment. Instead, despite their defeat, he won them further to his favour by making them swear to avenge themselves and win further glory in victory rather than wallowing in their failures and asking for punishment.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZnRMdTlkOHhENklmT3BXSzBkRnJBWXllY3FEVDdZeGpGS05EMk1wU2Q1R1dPWTZncWprYzdxX3JqMnhET081aXJEVGN0Z1VUY3BGZVp6cHJ0M05aY0E9PQ==

I'll also note that the Talk page for that article is several times longer than the article itself. Wikipedia is not a source, obviously, but that gives you an idea of how modern perception of the incident is still being influenced by propaganda.

"There was a major debate about the authenticity of this event a few years ago in China and needless to say it was a shit show. Like every debate around every wartime bravado turned into part of the collective memory since the dawn of men, It was as politicized as you can imagine with a very large amount of people on both sides already made up their mind long before inspecting any real evidence.

I think, in the end, some conclusions were agreed upon:

1, The 'original' wartime propaganda version of the event written just before the full escalation of Second Sino-Japanese war, depicting a small group of between 21 to 23 soldiers from the 2nd Company, 1st Battalion 4th Regiment securing the chains against a strong garrison including fortified machine gun positions, was likely exaggerated to some degree;

There is not much to say about this. The Luding bridge, famously dangerous as it was made from nothhing but wood plates on iron chains, would be very difficult to take once the wooden structure was burnt down. To take a foritified position against heavy machine guns, while crossing a river on iron chains, would be difficult for humans, regardless of how brave the men were. While this is not to cheapen the experience of the original narrators who experienced the battle in their own way for sure, further explanations would be needed;

2, The rather conspiratorial claim raised at the time, that the garrison unit (made up by the troops of the Sichuan warlords) 'made an agreement' with the attackers, was also found wanting. While this seems to be a more plausible explanation, the issue is that few evidence, historical, archaeological, or biographical, was there to support it. At best we have a few ethnically Chinese authors from other nations claiming to have interviewed some survivors from the era confirming a 'peaceful crossing', at worst there was nothing but guessing.

There is not much to say about this either. The so call intervewees have been giving vastlly different accounts and they were interviewed long after the event, decades since. While it is true that the CCP propaganda machine has every reason to be biased in trying to 'prove' the existence of a battle, one must note that these authors have every reason to be biased in trying to disprove it. It is bad history practice to take the an alternative version of the story just because the original one was biased.

3, Since then the efforts seem to be directed to finding other theses explaining the successful breakthrough.

Those trying to reconstruct the battle largely on the basis of the wartime depiction, i.e. wooden structure burnt, machine gun equiped garrison, etc, proposed alternative methods in crossing the bridge, trying to figure out the best way to cross a river on chains while shooting guns (seems misguided if you ask me, when the enemy had machine guns.)

Those looking from the campaign perspective proposed a more lighly guarded bridge. A battle still occured but according to this version, it occured first after a series of confusing engagements around the river and then a long, tiring rush to the bridge by both sides to take it first. The great confusing of the command structure and failure to appreciate the strategic importance of the bridge, in this case, led to the breakthrough, not unsimilar to the lose of Maleme Airfield in Crete.

These authors are the ones writing on the Kuomingtang sources, or whatever there was left to them. They still use the unreliable memory of surviving nationalist commanders, who was far from the battlefield and had reasons to tell a more favourable story to the new regime, but seems a step further than figuring out the best way to climb on a chian. According to the 1970s recounts, the 38th regiment, minus a battalion, of the 5th infantry was assigned to defend the regions around the bridge. The regiment was poorly equiped, and actually lost contact with its brigade command. Vastly outgunned by the red forces in terms of fire support across the river, the garrison was believed by these authors to fail to offer determined resistance and was already more than ready to retreat.

Other arguments are around, too. Some believe the wooden structure was not fully burnt and the bridge was still fit for walking at the time, at least to a degree. Deceptions were known to be used by both sides to trick the other into misidentifiying the units. Others believe in even more out-there batshit insane ideas.

Ultimately I don't think it matters that much...

People clinging onto constrcuted collective memories are not here to argue in good faith, neither are those obsessively rejecting the recount of an event just because it was the mainstream version. Those defending the bridge are long dead, as are those attacking it. We are still here. The living matter more than some long gone bloodshed and if, should war comes and our cause be just, we will have our own reasons to be brave. The past is the past and interesting mostly to the historic inquiry. But you know modern world can't let the dead just rest, cause politics.

"> Soviet Army saw absolutely no difference in the way it operated IFVs or APCs. Even in manuals their tactical use was written like ""IFV (APC)"".

This is...not wrong, but also not totally right.

First, the right. Soviet Army referred to all mounted infantry as Motostrelki, or Motor Rifle. In that regard, BTR- and BMP-equipped units were treated identically and expected to be capable of performing the same missions, akin to US mechanized infantry formations in the late 80s, during the M113 to M2 switch-over.

Now, the wrong. Soviets were not, generally, stupid. It did not take a genius to look at a BMP and BTR next to each other, and decide you would rather ride to the end of the world in a marginally better armed and better armored box. One major difference was support weapons - a BTR battalion would have dedicated ATGM teams which a BMP battalion would not, as its ATGMs were already on its BMPs. This can be analogized to how the M901 ITV was rendered obsolete by the introduction of the M2 - now the infantry carriers themselves could also carry ATGMs.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaYW1mOEdIR0wteXZxRVU4Wm16Z0ZhNjlKNXg2bWFMc0xGazlwaWxZQ0M5bkV0U0RqX0hLNVU1NkhZQkhGYWlTUW42NDZYWl9Majl5WV9WMFFyRmVRU1E9PQ==

"I can only speak about Bulgaria, as I served at those exact times. A very important factor we should concider is the extremely different way of doing things between the Russians and the Americans. One major difference is that during the Cold war the Soviets supplied member states with everything they need (machines, vehicles, rockets, know-how, spare parts). In return they required absolute obedience. There was also another thing -- we bordered two NATO states back then and tensions were always high, so we kept a strong army. Army training was tough even by russian standarts. In NATO, on the other hand, we can decide for ourselves whether to go to war or not, but we have to buy everything from money oriented companies. There were also requirements for joining NATO, that were brutal -- severe reduction of the menpower, destroying some of our most powerful capabilities and so on.. From an army of 160 000 prior to the fall of the Berlin wall, we have 30 000 men today.. I won't go into details, but you get the picture.

"You can’t really armor fuel tanks. It takes a lot of steel to reject a 500 lb bomb (6+ inches of armor grade steel), which is extremely impractical. Rather than armor them, you build many of them and spread them out so that a hit to any one tank doesn’t spread to all of the rest. So that it takes lots of bombs to knock out all of the tanks. Which reduces their individual value as a target, potentially to the point where if you can’t deliver enough bombs to destroy all of them, it’s better to drop those bombs on other targets instead. And while the tanks may not have exploded from just any damage, fire would have been just as bad and avgas is pretty flammable though somewhat less explosive than straight gasoline.

They were as well protected as everything else on Pearl Harbor. That is to say, their protection was contingent upon an alert and ready force of defenders rising to meet any attacker in the air well short of the tank farms with aircraft, while ground based AAA shot down anything that made it through. That failure to be prepared is the main failure on Dec 7th and the reason the army and navy garrison commanders were both sacked.

Otherwise, they were isolated from each other such that a leak and fire at one would not spread to the others except with assistance in the form of bombs and bullets.

I don’t know if any improvements to survivability were made to the existing tank farm during the war, but even before Pearl Harbor there was a massive construction project underway to build a series of underground tanks away from the base itself. It wasn’t finished until 1943.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaN3lzQWE5S2Vtc2pTUjBSc0dUaHlvSXphQzZFU2NrN3dqTlNuVk11YXBCXy1vU2N2Nk1wcnVrSlVHc2xVSF9Ec3ZwZXVxcWZoenlFcUthLWZreXhDQ1E9PQ==

As you can see they are pretty undefended besides what coastal battery positions and shipboard AA was in the vicinity. Which shipboard AA at this time would've primarily been .50 cals, 1.1in Chicago pianos and 3in cannons. The tanks would be your typical construction of sheet metal thick enough only to contain the pressures of fuel oil in them and would not have been hardened. An attack on that tank farm would have been really easy and those tanks would be at the very least susceptible to bursting had the outer structure been weakened by a attack.

Funnily enough in 1940 the government wanted to build a large fuel facility that would've been safe from aerial attack. Thus they began construction of the red hill underground fuel storage facility. The facility was built underground and had 20 tanks providing some 250million gallons of fuel storage. The facility wouldn't be opened until 1943. The facility was closed in 2022 citing environmental concerns and and reduced military need.

"FYI, your question is about geodetic datums, not just prime meridians, and it's an *enormous* can of worms. However big you think this can of worms is, it's bigger than that. Most US states have their own datum, some have several. California has 7. So it isn't just NATO.

Also, precisely nobody uses the prime meridian that runs through the Greenwich Observatory anymore.

There are a few reasons for why there are so many geodetic datums. First of all, we've been making maps and defining datums far longer than we've been able to measure the Earth accurately. As new technology develops and we refine older techniques, we can define more accurate datums, and we find out that we can make a better one; so we do. But we still have old maps that use the old datums.

Second, there's a difference between a global and a local datum. If we want to make a datum that works for the entire world, and a datum that works well for a small area, those are actually different goals. And for both of them, we have to make tradeoffs. It turns out that it's impossible to achieve both of them perfectly, so if we want something that's the best, but we only need it to work for one country, it will not line up with the rest of the world.

Also...people don't want to have to redraw every single map. So the old datums tend to stick around for a while. Even if in the US, some state and local governments use maps based on NAD 1927 (North American Datum of 1927) instead of the current WGS 84 (World Geodetic System of 1984) which is what the federal government and most states use.

"Red Hill was ultimately the protection option in the long run.  

With that said, one of their key ""defenses"" was the difficulty of actually destroying the complex.

As pointed out in other posts the fuel on hand was bunker fuel which isn't very volatile, it can be ignited but it tends to smolder vs explode.

This kind of touches on why the fuel tank farms weren't quite the targets that alternate history likes to make them to be.  One of the reasons the fleet was the target vs the support facilities is as the loss of most of the USN's Battleship fleet demonstrates, it took fairly few warheads on target to destroy a ship, and a ship is very complex  piece of machinery that might take years to produce.  Getting them while they're unready and easily destroyed, that's pretty win-win.  

You weren't going to get that 2-3 good hits=dead target payoffs from the fuel farm, or a lot of the support facilities, they needed significantly larger warheads, and likely more bombs than the IJN could credibly put on target (just in terms of platforms, there's a finite number of planes, and only the B5Ns could realistically carry the larger bombs needed for some of these targets.

As a result the first wave and second wave focused on the high payoff targets that would with just a few good hits, greatly impact the USN's ability to do much of anything.  A third wave might have been able to degrade or disrupt Pearl Harbor as a Naval Base, but defenses over Pearl Harbor were very active for the second wave, and the third wave would likely be a lot less successful (any not-destroyed interceptor was in the air, all guns manned), and the Japanese were racing against some time considerations (the Japanese were cutting it very close on fuel, and the realization the USN's carriers were not in Pearl Harbor but out there *somewhere* had some impact on the IJN leaving having won a stunning victory but not pushed their luck).",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaUUEwR2lYV3hzODQzUHZsZWJYY2dkSU9KYkNxZnVsQldFLV91UzJNaVlHY1hTcjV3STJ2dnNQdkhDbVVOUE1Gd1pOMzlXbTVWZ0d6QWVmMEQyVXl3LTlsMjg0WlU0WVBkalJaaWZoUTZrX2M9

Specifically, I've kind of stumbled upon (randomly, as you and many others here I imagine do) an article (read wikipedia page) about the Sniper Targeting pod on US Aircraft which is designed (?) to pick up friendly IR strobes for IFF purposes on the ground but how would this play out if the adversary was at a peer or even near peer level?

"Just read Word War II At Sea by Symonds after seeing it recommended here. It's good, a fairly light tour through the naval side of WW2. 

I quite like lighter books like this. I've also enjoyed stuff like Ian Tolls pacific series as well as more crunchy stuff like Shattered Sword about Midway. 

I also very much enjoyed Massies works on WW2 (Dreadnought and Castles of Steel). From the same era I recently liked A Mad catastrophe which is mostly about the terribleness of Austria Hungary. Have also liked most of Holger Herwigs books about WW1.

"Thanks, I appreciate it. As for where to start... hmm, after thinking about it for a bit, the best I can come up with right now is to **take Maths** classes in university or otherwise **study Maths**, a la Brian Reynolds advice in this interview: [https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/making-of-rise-of-nations](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/making-of-rise-of-nations)

>Oh - and if you had to give anyone some advice on becoming a designer?

>*“People come up to me and say “I want to be a game designer – what courses should I take?””*,

>Brian smiles.

>*""How about* ***probability and statistics?*** *And that’s not what they’re thinking. To me, the key thing about being a game designer is* ***being able to look at a curve and imagine the curve you want something to have and knowing what equation will create that curve***. *I want costs to go up like this or like THAT and being able to map these things onto other things, to do probability knowing if I do random numbers it’ll come out differently. You need to be able to internalise that. It’s a key thing.”*

Sorry I can't give a better answer, if you want to focus on Lanchester's Square Law specifically there's [this video by the Youtuber ""Spirit of the Law"" on its effects in Age of Empires 2/AoE2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpjxWBwLkIE) -- but if you want to focus on the more general idea of mathematical modeling for game design and what parts of math most commonly show up in games (even if the designer doesn't realize it), I can't think of any good resources off the top of my head, beyond just generally knowing a bunch of math.

If you want, you can read some of my other posts about specific mathematics things that show up in videogames, like

* [""Information Entropy""](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/19dww61/comment/kje1fbg/) *(the cause of much lag, because it tends towards a maximum, just like regular Entropy; in fact, it is exactly the same as regular physical Entropy, and this amongst other applications is the solution to* [*Maxwell's Demon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon)*)*,
* [""Hyperbolic Growth""](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/12lf3pm/comment/jg7m4bj/) *(why 4X games tend to snowball in favor of the leading player, even more than regular exponential growth would suggest)*, and
* [""Span of Control""](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/nxi93f/comment/h1ht9g6/) *(not exactly a mathematical concept such as a ""Human Factor design"" concept, but extremely relevant to the mathematics of game design, since it's easy to design a 4X game or whatever that grows beyond the player's comfortable Span of Control, since growing your empire is what the genre is about, and the number of clicks necessary to control your empire tends to grow linearly with its size \\[you can think of this in terms of* [Big O notation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-algorithms-big-o-analysis/) *if you want, O(N) rather than O(Constant) or O(Log N)\\].*
   * Look at **Clicker/Idle/Progression games** as a counterexample of how to make it so that pre-growth you click a lot, but post-growth you actually click **less**, the exact opposite of the typical progression in a 4X game.
   * Or look at ""**spreadsheet games**"" like[ *Imperialism* & *Imperialism 2*](https://www.idlethumbs.net/3ma/episodes/imperialism) (warning: long podcast link), where growing your empire just means typing in a bigger number to a single ""unit"" rather than having more units to control.
   * Or ""**automation genre**"" games like *Factorio* as an example of how to grow by an absolutely **insane** amount while keeping the demands on the player reasonable, through sucessive layers of gameplay automation: first you automate mining, then you automate crafting, then you automate transport, then you automate building, then you recursively automate building, until all you have to do to play the game is click where you want to build stuff.
   * There's also the option of just **taking things away from the player's control entirely**, like that upcoming RTS *""Battle Aces""* where instead of building worker units & replacing them when they get killed, they just automatically build themselves & rebuild themselves on a timer, so you don't have to even remember to click anything.

If you want I can keep talking, e.g.

* Lanchester's Square Law is essential to understanding why Wall of Force is a busted good combat spell in D&D in every edition it shows up in *(dividing an encounter in half = 2 encounters of one-quarter difficulty, because of Lanchester's Square Law = half-difficulty encounter.

You see this with Artillery deathballs in Civ 5, Grit's artillery deathball in Advance Wars 1 & 2, and Prism Tank deathballs in Red Alert 2, amongst other things.

"Guerilla tactics will always be both potentially effective and potentially destructive.

And the reverse of that is that guerilla warfare will always represent a deadly potential to the ""civilians"" ...

"I can only really speak to the German side; others might be able to advise on other participants' organisation.  Generally, the OKW attempted to group mobile units together into Armeekorps and Armees early in the war.  

For example, for the invasion of Poland, Guderian's XIX. Armeekorps contained the 3. Panzerdivision and the 2. and 20. Infanterie Divisions - both motorised, plus an additional battalion-strength unit of medium tanks: the *Panzerlehrabteilung*.  For the invasion of France, the Corps was totally re-arranged, but now contained three Panzer divisions (1st, 2nd, and 10th) and the motorised Infanterie-Regiment-Grossdeutschland.  For the invasion of Poland, XIX. Korps sat under the all-arms 4. Armee; for the invasion of France it was subordinated to Panzergruppe Kleist, a dedicated formation of tanks and motorised infantry.

Later in the war however, although there were continued efforts to group forces into Panzer Corps (most successfully within the SS, who to an extent maintained a separate command and organisational structure), this became more reactive; Panzer and mechanised formations began increasingly to be used as ""Fire Brigades"" to shore up weaknesses and perform local counter-attacks.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaOHIteERMU2ZxVDJGNC1WSVZjQkFiN3Y5R0VOUktfS3QwRmlGWWllbUk2QnBDY3FJb3NyNUpLY1o1bjh5UkRRc2NyZ1NQUGVTd0pCTTVqbnZKaG5CZ2c9PQ==

Strictly speaking, the IERS Reference Meridian is not a prime meridian.

(this is super important for satellites; if your satellite doesn't orbit the origin of your coordinate system, all the math you have to do to calculate your position is completely fucked) (there's also corrections for continental drift, although I don't really know the details.)

"Speaking for the Red Army, from 1942 onwards, their mechanized units were organized into tank and mechanized corps, although these were equivalant to divisional-sized formations (10-15,000 men, and around 200 tanks.) Tank and mechanized corps were either directly subordinate to field armies, or organized into tank armies, of which 6 were active throughout the war.


Tank armies were formations designed to carry out operational goals in scope, and were attached to fronts (the Soviet equivalant of an army group) or held in STAVKA reserve. In their original employment in 1942, their order of battle contained one or two rifle divisions, but in 1943 these were replaced with a mechanized corps - mechanized corps, in contrast to tank corps, featured a higher number of mechanized and motorized infantry - thus making the tank army a fully mobile formation. For the rest of the war, the typical tank army arrangement was two tank corps and one mechanized corps, although this varied according to army.


So how were they employed? Tank and mechanized corps subordinate to field armies were often used in support of breakthrough operations, while tank armies were meant to be inserted into a breakthrough, and exploit into operational depth. Their aim was not so much encircling enemy formations as it was occupying points in strategic depth (see Deep Battle theory). In practice, tank armies were often used to break through enemy defenses, especially in 1943, when the infantry echelons failed to completely break through the German defense.


Alongside tank armies were cavalary-mechanized groups, which is exactly as it sounds. Usually a cavalary corps and a mechanized or tank corps under a single commander. Their advantage was that cavalry could protect the tanks and operate in more difficult terrain, while tanks would give added firepower and protection to the cavalry forces. ",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaSHNTUlp1WjNVVWFUQU9SQ3gyRkY3YmE4SHA0YlhXOXlXWUlKZFZibU1VMjIwSVE1RmZfVHdGenlZOE9FcjlHMXc4Ui1lUjhrb1dYVFhqZDM2RFVUUXE2anNRQzlQdHMyeDA2aUdhRnJBRW89

"It had to do with the nature of Mongol society. The Mongols were nomadic pastoralists, an economic model that was not labor intensive. Other societies practiced sedentary agriculture, which was extremely labor intensive. 

In very simple terms, the Mongols (and other steppe nomads) were able to dedicate a higher percentage of their male population to war because they didn’t require as many men to be engaged in food producing activities as sedentary agricultural societies. It takes relatively few men to mind a herd, but it takes a lot of dedicated labor to work the fields. Additionally herds could be marched alongside the army and to a certain extent the primary difference between the steppe nomads at war and steppe nomads at peace was really just the presence of women and children. 

Additionally the nature of nomadic society meant that the basic activities of everyday life were very close to those of an army at war. Riding, shooting, hunting, making camp, working as a group, and making and maintaining all your own kit are all activities that prepare a man very well for military service. By contrast tilling fields, harvesting, maintaining livestock, and the myriad other activities that are required in sedentary agriculture are not activities that make a man a better soldier. 

That said, sedentary agriculture does produce a lot more food for the same amount of effort, which allowed sedentary societies to develop much greater levels of specialization. They could produce more and better weapons and armor, as well as support permanent military personnel. 

More can be said, but I hope that gives you some idea.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMzRkWVc0NVBXbnh3aW5yRlhURjFrcE5yYjhPNDlXRU5BbDVhTlY5RGF0S09WaXk2alJoMElJTk1fLXdxZzZERVEwSzhjOFA5N0UyTHBUR3Zwa3UzRFE9PQ==
"Both. You maximize throughput if the aircraft flies individually. The spacing is determined by operational factors. Basically, keep in mind that there are bottlenecks at each end. Not just runways but also cargo facilities, refueling, etc. It would be more efficient to receive one aircraft every X minutes than getting a bunch of aircraft all at once. Optimizing the spacing and related procedures (such as what to do if an aircraft misses its approach or has a mechanical problem) was a major preoccupation during the Berlin Airlift.

Of course, if you are expecting to be attacked, then you might use formations. Also, if it's okay for all the cargo to arrive at once, you might use formations. This is the case in a paradrop situation: you want to saturate the drop zone.

Note that maritime convoys are inefficient for similar reasons. You have to load all the ships before departing. This means the ships that got loaded first have to wait around for days or even weeks. Then the ships arrive at their destination and swamp its unloading facilities. Basically, by convoying you sacrifice maximum efficiency of your merchant tonnage and cargo facilities to provide safer voyages. That is part of why during the world wars there was such reluctance to adopt convoys. ""Do we really have to go through all this hassle?""",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaWFFsd01oMWQ0c0tHWDNEM3luTXZOVjk0eWRvM0otM0JhNll3U25CZl9ibW5iY2dfTUNnZWQ3cFk0cFdNeTNqbUxSX1FYTFFxY2dITmU0TlBEVjBxRlE9PQ==
"As you said, agricultural societies created surplus which could be sold/exchanged for goods and labor, which led to specialization and in many cases advancements that made them militarily superior. The downside was it created a large group of men who could live their entire lives without learning martial skills. The people they ""paid"" to be the military may have been more advanced than a pastoral society on a certain level, but there weren't as many of them compared to the total population, and the nature of a settled society also created vulnerabilities that pastoral societies could exploit. 

The proliferation of gunpowder weapons was a huge leg up for agricultural societies in that regard, because it allowed for rapid training of soldiers who otherwise might not have innate martial training. As has often been noted, an English longbowmen (not to mention a knight or man at arms) takes a lifetime to train, whereas you can train a man to fire a musket in a few hours, and to be a soldier in a few weeks. 

Agricultural societies became the dominant form of society globally over time, but there was still a trade off, and sometimes those societies when they came into contact with more pastoral ones paid a heavy price for it (particularly before firearms). But for the most part those were just the edge cases.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaVmVhV21YYndrN0I2cEItVU9IcVoxY3N6Mk1aSHVjcExYREFpZURnOVI4Qk1Ea3dfWi01a3IzYVR6SHRIYWpDWmpsbWhhVG9PQ1A5enRZOGQ4NE1Tbnc9PQ==
"A shipping convoy enables you to concentrate vulnerable targets, thus enabling assets to protect them more easily than if they were scattered. That’s the gain of a convoy of any kind. The trade off is a drop in efficiency, since you have to wait for the ships to all get together, all have to be loaded before they can go, they all have to sail at the speed of the slowest ship, etc. And you have to put more work into organising it.

In the Berlin airlift, the planes weren’t being shot at, and therefore did not need to be grouped for ease of protection. Grouping them would have required them to do massive formations in orbit above whichever airbase they flew from, like was done with bombers in WW2, but for absolutely no gain. If you look at what they did in Berlin, like the block system that sent a plane every four minutes at increasing altitudes: a convoy breaks the efficiency of that.

In the Hump, very few of the flights were intercepted. Some were, but not the majority. Protection by other assets was largely out of the question given the route, though that changed later in the war. The major threat was mechanical or weather problems, or terrain issues, which flying in large formation does not solve. And given the extreme ranges they were operating at, forming up just makes it more likely they run out of fuel before they reach their destination, and introduces difficulties in landing.

When you see transport aircraft grouped together, it’s because they’re either flying into contested airspace that requires protection, or they’re carrying stuff that needs to be kept close together on landing. So paratroopers tend to be dropped by congregated aircraft. The rest of the time, you lose efficiency for no gain.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRF9LUzQzeVQxOUt3VTdGXzdhclA1d3pZdGNKS1o3OWRGWHB6aGlHVGZtNFR5MkNPRXhqby1ia3dBLXZmM1d0TVBxY0JfMHBLWEE4ZkI2TnBuREZKeEE9PQ==

"The thing about the Mongols: their army weren't that big, despite what you may believe.

Your typical image of a Mongol horde is an entire ocean of men and horses moving across wide open plains showering so many arrows they blot out the sun.

In reality, they weren't that big.

On one hand, you must consider that historians lie for a variety of reason. It wasn't uncommon for the defeated to inflate the attacker's numbers to excuse their defeat. For example, when the Vietnamese troops were slaughtered at Bình Lệ Nguyên, Vietnamese history tried to claim there were some 20,000 Mongols and 20,000 Yunnan troops; in reality, the entire Mongol force that destroyed Vietnam during the first invasion probably numbered at most 5,000 as they were a secondary force. But good luck trying to explain to people how 5,000 Mongols - maybe even as low as 3,000 - destroyed a Vietnamese army that could have been 80,000 strong and forced the Trần dynasty to run for the jungles. To makes matter worse, maybe some rebellious noble would look at that and say, ""If the Mongol can do it with 3,000 men, then what stops me from doing the same?"" Sometimes, it wasn't because the historians were trying to excuse themselves: the Mongols were extremely mobile, appearing in and out of nowhere like during their invasion of the Khwarazmian Empire. One army could easily look like five, and the Mongols also used propaganda and inflated their numbers to scare the living daylight out of the defenders. Also, Mongolian army did not travel alone: a *tumen* of ten thousands would also be accompanied by slaves, support staffs, craftsmen, relatives, etc. So, an army of fifty thousands may only have ten thousands fighting men.

On the other hand, the ratio wasn't that high. There were about 2 million Mongols by the time of the invasion of China, and most source had it that about a 100,000 of them joined the invasion, or 5% of the total population. Later on, their armies became bigger but so too was the population base as now they incorporated more people and with it more soldiers. The later Mongolian army wasn't Mongol: there was Chinese siege engineers, Arab medicine men, Korean sailors, Italian guides etc.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRW1rcURGbzdtNDNRQzFzLW5uZ0s2Ylp1LXl5bWZHMDZwYVRQQ0RWMXA0UzF2bG9XbkRGOFZzYU9LQ1M4bHpnaXA5RE1EbU1CdVllWndVVUFzTkNqTE1iSXdjb29kczJFTkFEMWh3TllhYUk9

"It is perhaps arguable that the Mongols,  like other steppe pastoral nomads were able to field formidable armed forces because their lifestyle - their everyday survival depended on skills which amounted to military training.  The pastoral lifestyle meant that they had to manage and guard large herds of livestock.  To do this over large swaths of steppe,  their youngest were on horseback and learning archery skills as toddlers.  They learned methods for hunting/scouting/patrolling as we would learn our ABCs.   As their herds of livestock and horses would quickly consume pasturage,  permanent housing was unsuitable, so they lived in packable yurts or yurts mounted on carts.  Here's Herodotus describing why the Scythians - early steppe pastoralists were ""unconquerable"":

 *Book IV, chapter 46: “Having neither cities nor forts, and carrying their dwellings with them wher­ever they go: accustomed, moreover, one and all of them, to shoot from horseback: and living not by husbandry but on their cattle, their waggons the only houses that they possess, how can they fail of being unconquerable, and unassailable even?""*

The Mongols like the Scythians were something like natural-born horse archers.  There was no need for individual training as recruits,  their lives were their training.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRW12N2Q5cG1iZWhJMzdDbDBpMTV2bGtLekc3UVEtWjRrcWJFbUlpaFF2ci1PVTJRbEJIZ1ZGUHFDSjh5Z0pKLU1sMjh5Tk1YMVkzZHdwcjcxcXNsSVE9PQ==
"Bombers and fighters fly together to maximize firepower at an objective. Transports don't have firepower, they have a timetable, and there's X amount of time it takes a plane to enter a pattern, land, and taxi off the runway. There's no advantage in terms of survivability to have transports grouped together whatsoever, and it's extremely inconvenient to the actual goal of getting cargo to its destination.

The ideal transport aircraft formation is thus a stream, not a formation, similar to the British bombing stream of WW2 where they had a setup to get a stream of X aircraft into and out of Y point by T time, ensuring minimum separations to minimize exposure to attack in a combat zone.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaaFo2V0tzdndoX0FrVEh0WmZ3NnE5LWkxQURtVzlrRFA0MVExTHk0eEhwNWo1am9Gclo0TXpJMEJncmxCeVgyMlZ0M19LdFBMelJjaEpNeDlCblRNS2c9PQ==
"And it's even debatable how well BB's did shore bombardment. In WW II they could fire a large shell a very long way, but the delay between fire mission and the shell landing and accuracy from those ranges often meant BB bombardments weren't terribly accurate. Some of the most effective shore bombardments of WW II were performed by Destroyers with their comparatively small 5 inch guns. Much faster firing and closer to shore, they were often better at providing on target support to infantry than the BB's. And while a 5 inch gun was small for a ship back in that day, it was freaking huge for anything on land and could pretty much demolish whatever it hit outside of heavily reinforced static defenses. 

Then again, a role of artillery since the beginning was to make the infantry feel good, and the infantry definitely felt better when it had big gun BB's firing their shells at the bad guys, whether they hit anything or not.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaME9XNktkWks2MlRkdWhNVXlUWXc1NVBudlpuN2VHcVNFVTFOMXBSNG4tRXJ4bVFVc0E2c3MtV1hHOENicl9Bd20xRkkxZG1LaHR5SjdXbDQxdlMtLVE9PQ==

"One of the greatest advantages the Mongols had was their willingness to incorporate conquered peoples into their armies. Their relative religious freedom also greatly helped with incorporating new cultures into their warbands. While we think of mongols as being horseback warriors, they were more than happy to recruit heavy infantry and other units aside from their traditional light cavalry. They were willing to adapt quickly to new tactics and circumstances as well, improving their armour, tactics, siege weapons, and more.

No corrections to anything you've said, just wanted to expound :)",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNnhsMXgzaDJvcWU1WVJfOFJmS0ZNZmU5eE5rRHpyQmdEMXhyTFR3MnVlbldJYS1uMkNtdGhydWxlSldOZ1l2cDNJMm13ejBsdXVMNllQU294ZUw4Unc9PQ==
"It is a very complex issue to compare directly from a monetary point of view due to a number of peculiar institutional circumstances under which Soviet foreign trade was conducted. These include the inconvertibility of the ruble and the inconvertibility of the currencies of other Bloc nations, with which the Soviet Union transacted the bulk of its trade on a strictly bilateral-balance basis. Additionally, there was a highly manipulated internal price structure that differed markedly from that of any Western nation.

It is also inadvisable to directly compare costs from different sources because they might use different criteria or different time spans. This makes conversion not only difficult due to inflation but also further complicated by the economy of scale (for example, an AFV just entering service will be much more expensive than a vehicle at the end of the production run). For example, this is the list by Chobitok:

* BMP-1: 108,287 rubles
* BMP-2: 228,641 rubles
* BMD-1: 137,748 rubles
* BMD-2: 174,720 rubles
* BTR-70: 45,848 rubles
* BTR-80: 108,108 rubles
* T-55: 98,139 rubles
* T-55AM: 144,677 rubles
* T-62: 82,571 rubles
* T-62M: 153,525 rubles
* T-64: 230,880 rubles
* T-64A: 249,033 rubles
* T-64B: 512,737 rubles
* T-64B1: 421,934 rubles
* T-64BV: 536,028 rubles
* T-72A: 337,247 rubles
* T-72B: 421,200 rubles
* T-80: 936,000 rubles
* T-80B: 826,800 rubles
* T-80UD: 1,143,480 rubles

However, Chobitok also provides elsewhere that the BTR-70 cost around 29,000 rubles, which was approximately 55% of the cost of a T-62. Both pieces of information are correct, but they cannot be directly compared due to differences in context and criteria. Generally, a BTR was half the price of a BMP, which in turn cost around the same as older, cheaper tanks, but less than contemporary main battle tanks that included costly fire control systems.

Occasionally, multiple systems can be compared simultaneously, providing a more accurate picture. For example, the regular OT-64 version with a 14.5mm turret was priced at 754,000 CzK, while the radio/command versions (R-2, R-3, R-4) ranged between 1.15 and 1.9 million CzK. In comparison, the T-54 cost approximately 1 million CzK, the T-55A and BMP-1 each cost 1.8 million CzK, and the K-61 amphibious tracked cargo carrier was priced at 291,000 CzK in the late 1950s.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRWlCVXByWXVubG4wOHBuMnM4VUNENWJjSDQ3QVlRc1hHbkhrR2R6VXotel9iU3hGdGF6VG1TQmpRanZPT1AwbFBUdHF1VjRYd1A1VmdQVVloc1Vrd2c9PQ==

"As you wrote, agriculture includes maintaining livestock. Before modern industrial farms, this meant herding livestock - cattle, domestic water buffaloes, sheep, and goats. They also had to keep away bears and wolves, which were much more widespread than nowadays (we have many folk stories about herders and wolves, and about bears in forests). If it takes relatively few men to mind a herd, this sounds very similar to nomads.

NATO columns would be spotted and decimated by MLRS as easily - professional soldiers turn into red mist as easily as conscripts. Any NATO penetration can as easily be blunted by a pair of attack helicopters - NATO tankers don’t learn how to dodge LMUR mid flight.

"The Halifax Explosion resulted from disregard of existing safety procedures. People knew how to transport explosives by ship in relative safety but chose not to because of wartime exigencies. Unfortunately, the people of Halifax paid the price.

Just some orientation for readers: the Halifax Explosion was a manmade disaster that occurred on December 6, 1917. Two merchant ships, SS *Mont-Blanc* and SS *Imo*, collided in Halifax harbor. Fires broke out on SS *Mont-Blanc*, which caused her cargo of explosives to detonate. The resulting explosion was equivalent to nearly 3 kilotons of TNT. This destroyed much of Halifax, killing perhaps 1,600 people outright, causing injuries to about 9,000 more, and rendering tens of thousands without adequate shelter in the Canadian winter.

Normal precautions that were ignored include the following:

* Vessels carrying explosive cargo are supposed to fly a large red flag. This warns everyone else to stay clear. But this practice was largely suspended during the war on the rationale that a huge red flag would attract enemy attention.
* Vessels carrying explosive cargo are supposed to stay in isolated areas as much as possible. In Halifax, the prewar procedure had been to load and unload explosives in a different basin before entering the main harbor. This was not done during the war because it took much longer and there was pressure to get all vessels into the protected main harbor as quickly as possible.
* There are also a lot of rules of navigation to prevent collisions, one of which is segregating traffic. Normally in the narrow channel going right through Halifax (the Narrows), inbound traffic would have been on one side and outbound traffic on the other side. But there were so many vessels in the busy wartime port that this had gone somewhat out the window. SS *Imo*, attempting to leave the harbor, got crowded over to the side for entering vessels like SS *Mont-Blanc*. This was apparently fairly common at the time. But that is what put the ships in position to collide.

If these precautions had been followed, it's hard to see how the explosion would have occurred. SS *Mont-Blanc* wouldn't have been steaming into a crowded area with a dangerous cargo at all. So the problem here was really failure to follow rules that would reduce a known risk, not discovering an unknown risk.

There were, however, a lot of lessons learned as a result of the Halifax Explosion especially with respect to eye surgery (many of the injured had glass in their eyes) and providing aid in mass casualty events.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNDJTWU92OEhrcUNNX294TmpVT3h1cm1zUzczcmNxUHRidU9DOEVmTHc0dW8wQkRWRDQ4c2RXenQ3eHJZNUpiRmkxR1E4Y0l3T3JJLXRIUFdyUzltZ2c9PQ==
"Setting aside the actions of the CCP which have a lot of controversy as to their historical accuracy, and impacts. The KMT had established a network of guerilla actions and intelligence gathering under the Juntong or NBIS, which heavily infiltrated the ranks of the Japanese established Re-organised government of China headed by Wang Jingwei in Nanjing. The armed forces of the Wang Jingwei regime were extensively compromised reducing their combat effectiveness in combating the KMT and aligned forces, similarly intelligence about Japanese troop movements were passed onto the Juntong. The Juntong also operated cells designed to rescue downed pilots over Japanese controlled parts of China, despite friction between Dai Li and the OSS over control of operations.

You also had multiple rural militias in China who such as the Red Spears, the Big Sword Societies, and Yellow Sands who during the Second Sino-Japanese war fought both Japanese and KMT incursions into rural China to requisition/seizing of supplies and men. Many were subverted and absorbed into the CCP during and after the war.

As for Japanese COIN, it was effective in Manchuria at suppressing bandits, the nominally CCP aligned NAJUA, and the remnants of the Fengtian clique such as Ma Zhanshan's forces, partially as a result of local collaborators previously in the Fengtian clique, and the Kwantung armies large presence and ability to use the dense railroad network to move troops and supplies (as compared to the rest of China). In the rest of China it was less effective as the brutal methods and expropriations, lack of manpower, and comprised nature of the Wang Jingwei regime made it difficult to control territory outside of the rail and river network of China.

"No. Personal example: both my great-uncles served in the same regiment in WW1. The first joined early, and got posted to the training battalion in England, working in the kitchen. His only injury was a hernia from lifting a side of pork out of a truck. His brother, who joined a year later, was posted to the BEF in 1917, and got shot in the arm in Belgium in August. Blighty wound, and he lost the use of that arm.

"Nomadic societies can always convert large percentages of their men into soldiers. There's no homes to look after, no farms to tend or even defend, and their herds, which are at the core of their economy, can be moved with them. The Huns, the Bedouin Arabs, the Sanhaja Berber confederation, the various waves of Turkic nomads, and the Great Plains tribes of North America could maintain a similarly high ratio of warrior to civilian, for many of the same reasons. 


The downside of nomadism, militarily, is that while you may be able to convert a high percentage of your populace into fighters come wartime, that population is in and of itself unlikely to be super high. Pastoralists and hunter-gatherers are less likely to produce surplus food than agriculturalists which makes expanding a population hard. This is one of the reasons, in fact, why nomads often have to raid their settled neighbours for, among other things, food. Left to their own devices they're often living a subsistence life, and if something happens to the herds they depend on, it can be a demographic disaster. 


The typical way around the issues of population size is, accordingly, to ally with or absorb other groups into yourself. The Huns incorporated large numbers of Goths, Alans, Sarmatians, etc, into their military. The Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates recruited recently converted Persians and Berbers to bulk out their Arab armies. The Almoravid Sanhaja pulled troops from the Zanata and Masmuda Berber confederations, the North African Arabs, and Black West Africa. The Seljuks swallowed up other Turkic tribes and conscripted Persians and Arabs as they rolled into the old Abbasid territories. The Lakota, Comanche, et al, used abduction and adoption to make up their losses. Etc, etc. 


The Mongols accomplished what they did because Genghis Khan and his immediate successors employed the above strategy extremely effectively. Genghis not only absorbed all of the Mongol warbands into his own, but did the same with the Turkic tribes of Central Asia, giving himself a far greater pool of manpower than he'd have gotten out of Mongolia alone. There's a reason you'll often hear the term ""Turco-Mongolian"" and it's because of the extent of intermingling that already existed between those groups, something that Genghis took full advantage of. Later claimants to the Mongol imperial legacy, like Tamerlane and Babur, will be almost wholly Turkic in ethnicity but will still view the world through a Mongol cultural lens. 


Beyond the Turks, the Mongols recruited from all the other peoples they encountered too. Arabs, Persians, and Han Chinese, as well as the many, many minorities living under Arab, Persian, Turkic, or Chinese rule all find their way into Mongol armies. When Kublai Khan conquers southern China he does it with an army that contains more northern Chinese than it does ethnic Mongols. The Mongol thrusts into the Islamic world are supported by large numbers of Turkic and Persianate soldiers from the recently conquered Central Asian Khwarazmian Empire. The Mughal conquest of India was only possible because of all the Indians that were hired to supplement the Turco-Mongolian and Afghani invaders. 


Indeed as a general trend you'll see that where the Mongols fail to expand, there's typically a lack of local manpower to draw on. The Mongols in Syria were at the end of their logistical rope and were up against Mamluk Egypt, which controlled all the important military forces in the Levant. The early Mongols could make devastating raids into India but couldn't occupy it, because the Delhi Sultanate had a monopoly on the subcontinental mercenary pool; the Mughal invasions centuries later will succeed because that's no longer the case. The Mongols beat numerous Southeast Asian armies, but couldn't recruit enough Vietnamese, Chams, Khmers, etc, to make holding the region possible. And so on and so forth. Wherever the recruitment drive ends, that's usually where Mongol expansion ends too. ",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaQV9CWmdOSUcyU29KbHhOSjI4QWhTaDNzZmVkaDBUandUNWdPVHNjNnBJM0hLejZaMFVwMjJiaUtUOW1iaklxSWE0N2ZkTzZTX040dzA0YzU1YTBlMDZkMkNvR2hpc3pyaXRBOVNRdDZmd009

"Steppe nomads, by their nature, are pre-made soldiers. They're accustomed to fighting, raiding and banditry. They turn up with their own horses, bow and pre-made social predisposition to violence. All you really need to do is put them into a broader overall structure.

Most likely there weren't that many Mongols anyway, but horse archery is an extremely potent tactical *modus* in open field fighting, so it has an outsize impact compared to, say, conventional infantry levies. This obviously breaks down when you run into fortifications or disciplined heavy/missile infantry or bow-armed medium cavalry, but overall it's incredibly powerful.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaOGVhOUp3TGZEV2hZT1ZlOGo3SU5CVmxnbHlCREk3R3FMOERETUM5SlJnZWtadnJWWmxkVmc3X0FtejFLTjhDX19HeGZtYVRrdlpxdFRNNmdHb0NYMEE9PQ==
">Pastoralists and hunter-gatherers are less likely to produce surplus food than agriculturalists which makes expanding a population hard.

Not militarily related, but this is increasingly looking unlikely. Examination of North American pastoralist societies shows some fairly significant surpluses obtained from hunting and gathering. This observation is true for the Eurasian steppe which is the primary focus of our enquiry. 

Reccomend Webgrove and Graeber's The Dawn of Everything for more detail",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNad28tbklHV3p2YlIwcUJQLUhaaVdqSzZ0eWZVaEVjTUtzakpFVmF0WXF2ZGFmTURONks0UjM1RXBOUTNMcDB4QWZRZ2Y1UmRXYmo5WkczLVBwck5wOWc9PQ==
"As others have already noted, Mao spent very little time trying to fight the Japanese and a lot more plotting to stab Chiang Kai-Shek in the back after the Nationalists had done the bulk of the fighting. If you're looking for more on the Chinese theatre, I'll recommend ""Forgotten Ally,"" which takes a long hard look at the wartime actions of Chiang, Mao, and the collaborationist government of Wang Jingwei. 


Japanese COIN was long on brutality and dubious on results. They killed millions of Chinese civilians but failed to shut down Chiang's intelligence networks and never really put much effort into hunting down Mao (who was, after all, not really spending much effort fighting them either). They burned villages, razed cities, and murdered, raped, or both, everyone they encountered, but could never exert real control over China outside of the urban centres or coastal regions--and even in the former their rule was tenuous due to Dai Li's connections to the many KMT associated street gangs that dominated the back alleys and underbellies of most Chinese cities. 


Outside of China, the Japanese were never able to eliminate the Malayan, Filipino, Indonesian, or Melanesian insurgents either. In Malaya they had to rely on the Communists to eliminate the KMT guerillas for them. In Aceh they lost control of the countryside to marauding bands of gazis that they themselves had armed. In Borneo, the Dayaks ruled the jungles and the Japanese rarely left their posts. In the Philippines, Catholic Filipinos, Muslim Moros, and pagan Igorot headhunters tied down thousands of Japanese troops. And in Melanesia, the Papuan Infantry Battalion, the Pacific Islanders Regiments, and the irregulars that they subcontracted out to, never had any trouble infiltrating Japanese lines. 


The Japanese tried to eliminate those groups with the same kind of mass killings they'd used in China and got the same results. Their starvation policy in Indonesia cowed the collaborationist government of Java and killed several million Indonesians but cost them Aceh and Borneo. The destruction of all life they came across in the rural Philippines gave the pro-American and Moro separatist groups alike a recruiting bonanza. And their cannibal rampage through New Guinea cost them any chance of winning over locals who were dissatisfied with the Australians who, whatever their myriad flaws, didn't eat the natives. ",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMzVJYzJLNWdVX0l2aWM0bzJvQ29hOXlTdkp5WkhhLXgyNkw5UkpONWgtSC1jMDlDaDMtTFE1VlFBVHVoZ1FabFFQeEVOTzQwWGU2N01VUk1oN0R1WE1pTk54UGtZb1BPTmljcjVHbnJvT3c9

"You hit a pretty sharp east/west dividing line in Europe where pastoralism was no longer viable. The Hungarian Plain is pretty much the last major grassland in Europe suitable for large herds. West of that, livestock was more scarce and the larger animals, especially horses, had to be fed grain to make up for the lack of pasturage. A French or English village might have a meadow where the plow oxen were grazed, and the pigs might be allowed to run around the village's little patch of woods, but that didn't require a horse or any special skills. The effort went to growing cereal crops, which were extremely labor intensive.

Put another way, if you're on the steppe, the limit to the number of horses you can have is your physical ability to herd them, since you can always move to find new grass. In western Europe, the limiting factor is the cost to feed them.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhSUdiamktTEI1bE1GQ1Y4TFAta0JuN2FhQ2d0UlhBRDZMUGl6RW9xb040LVlBYlprZmFOM3BLMjFpTXU4VzEyOFpvZG5jdWxod2lJNEh3dFlIQTZNLWc9PQ==

"For the most part after 1943 many of the battles do become to the death in the Pacific itself.  As u/-Trooper5745- details, Kiska and Guadalcanal did had mass evacuations at the failures of those campaigns but they are very much the exception, for the most part once the Americans were preparing to land the island was effectively cut off (or the US was not going to commit to a landing without controlling the area around an island to the degree evacuation wasn't possible).  

To call out Guadalcanal and Kiska specifically, they both were battles early enough into the war the USN/USAAF didn't have the same degree of sea/air control 

The small scale of many of these islands too meant there was just no depth too, no safe place for troops to pull back to that could be used for an evacuation location.

Most of your veterans thus, outside of the evacuated survivors of Kiska (and Kiska not even really being a battle in a lot of ways) and Guadalcanal are going to be veterans of multiple battles in a lengthy campaign.  The Papa New Guinea fighting for instance, dragged on for years in many ways, and there were ultimately Japanese survivors of that nightmare (this word is not used lightly, beyond the combat, ultimately the isolated Japanese forces had to survive in some of the most hostile to human life environments on the planet).  Similarly the Liberation of the Philippines went on for some time and Japanese units were still in combat against American ground forces when the war ended meaning some veteran troops were present there although they hardly went on to other battles obviously.  

Similarly many Pacific garrison units would have some veterans from China or earlier campaigns, especially as increasingly the better forces present in China were shifted to bolster defenses in the Pacific (by the time the Soviets hit Manchuria most of the ""good"" units had long since been sent to the Pacific or recalled to the homeland)",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhZlNMbXhERmxKQkFhdmtsVHlfQWJheElyYW5PenNPUWk5bVo4M2ltX1ZmclIxeWdFVUNVVkRQR0RrSDhKU1hfZndhVGRUSjhXUkNBekFqSWduU1ZNWmNNTGFFVjBvaFpSdTNLd0I1ZFlUbG89

to have been destroyed and the company,
reinforced with the reconnaissance troop

day of 9 June to force a crossing. They
forded the river late in the afternoon,
seized Auville-sur-Ie Vey, and held it during the night while engineers built the bridge behind them. Contact with the airborne unit the next day was only the beginning of the link between the corps.

Because strategic calculation of cost, benefit, risk etc. is saying **no** (currently).

US could have given ultimatum to Belarus, that if they don't stop hosting Russian military, they will attack them. As far as we know, they didn't. If Belarus decided to play ball, and told the US to go ahead if they dare, US would be put in very uncomfortable situation, of either ignoring their strategic calculus, or losing face. Ironically, Russia has done so many times, with her threats of using nuclear weapons.

Losing face, especially in a theater were you depend greatly on your allies (European continent for US), is a very bad thing. 

Same holds true for your hypothetical legal exclaves. If Russia decided to engage Polish and Romanian airfields, war would come to these countries. Cordoning the damage to territory of those airfields would be impossible. Sooner or later, even with no malicious action against civilians, a shot down missile, debris etc. would kill local civilians. Suddenly, local politicians would be under a lot of pressure to either kick out UAF, or call for article 5. 

Then, suddenly, every other NATO member state, would be again asked to either go against their (apparent) strategic calculus, or lose face. Refusing to answer the call of ally would be an order of magnitude more serious than making an empty threat.

Why didn't Ukraine attack Belarus after Russian invasion? Why isn't Russian-Ukrainian border (barring most recent Russian offensive, subjected to 1 year rule) a warzone to level of Donetsk oblast, war limited to small scale raids? Because Ukraine made a strategic decision that such move would be suboptimal. 

TLDR: breaking this ""double standard"" would mean going against current strategic calculus of US and her European allies.

Note: strategic calculus doesn't guarantee ""rational"" decisions. Of course, strategic actors can guess wrong, and strategic calculus is too much diverging from reality. Sometimes, strategic actors have priorities that are hard to understand, or irrational themselves. And one can argue that decision makers can have personal agendas, that can be at odds of state agenda (eg. politicians starting a ""small"" war to boost their own popularity)",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhaWM0ZFM0eFJtbEFSeWl1U0kzSHhFTThWUUFlc2JJUXRXV2pNbjVVaEtZZzh5MnRZSDNoY05lVE55UmFza1VYOHlkV0l1T0F3MjFWVE9jZ0VSVFRUQWc9PQ==
"The needs of agricultural labor are not just planting and harvesting. There is an unending series of tasks that need doing in order to support an agrarian society. Every man you pull out of agricultural task is one less man producing food. In the short term you can commit large portions of men to war, but it won’t take long before the economic implications of cutting your food producers catches up with you. 

Rome is much more the exception than the rule here. Rome had a massive agricultural capacity, in part because it controlled high quality agricultural land, and in part because it had a large slave population that carried out many agricultural tasks. Roman citizens represented a relatively small portion of the overall Roman population, and because of the reserves of labor Rome could afford to heavily commit its citizen population to warfare when needed. Rome also had a relatively complex administrative system which allowed it to more effectively exploit its agricultural production. 

Leaving that aside, the majority of a population in a sedentary agricultural society will be employed in agriculture full time. While some agricultural societies could put large numbers of men in the field short term, the overwhelming majority of the population won’t have time or energy to dedicate to Military skills. Additionally, unlike in nomadic pastoralists society the daily life of an agricultural worked does not adequately prepare them for war. However, the economic surplus a sedentary agricultural society produces does allow a small segment of society to pursue military endeavors full time. At a certain point in an agricultural society the question comes up, what is a better use for these ten farmers? Do I really benefit from having 10 more untrained farmers on the battlefield, or would they be better used at home growing more food so that I can put one more well equipped, trained professional in the field? 

In reality the math was very rarely that simple or direct, but the basic idea was consistent. An agricultural worked is much more useful to his society at home producing food than he is on the battlefield.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhZG90RU1vdmlrQXJSVWR6Q0RkV1JfajJqUUQzcVgwU0w2Y0tLdnFPa2RNX0xobFUzUURQUWVRRi1RV2hyQUc0bzViaVZsZi1idjctck1yRkdrYzl4TEE9PQ==

"The Tiger and Panther weren't overweight.

The Tiger was an heavy tank, here other heavy tank and the year they started production. KV-1 45t (1939), KV-2 52t (1939), Tiger 53t (1942), IS-2 46t (1943), IS-4 53t (1946). The Tiger had a similar weight than contemporary heavy tanks.

The Panther tank was in-between an Heavy and Medium tank and the US did something in the similar weight class. Panther 44t (1943) vs Pershing 42t (1944). This one really come down to what is the strategy behind which tank a country decided to focus on. The US focused on their 30t M4 only during the war and then the 42t Pershing was added toward the end of the war. The Russian focused on both a 30t T-34 and multiple 45-55t Heavy tank. The German started the war with 25t Panzer III and IV, supplemented them with 53t Tiger heavy tank, but by the end of the war their 25t Panzer were becoming obsolete and they decided to go for a 44t Panther.

Is your train of thought : more road wheels = more complicated suspension? Because those are two different things.

When you choose what will be the road wheels of your tank you need have two choices. Less of bigger wheels mean less resistance and more speed. More of smaller wheels mean more ground pressure. You need to find a balance between the two, but with interleaving wheels you can have the best of both world. You a lot of big wheels so you have less ground pressure and good speed, which make your tank very agile. Yes the drawback of maintenance is important, each countries had to decide what was more important for them.

The German often decided to prioritize the best performance because their goals was to win decide battle and the best battle performance gave them this advantage, maintenance could be done in-between battle. For the US, they simply didn't have the luxury of sending back broken tank back to factories. They had to maintain their logistic over a whole ocean and so low maintenance and reliability was highly prioritize. The Soviet were plagued with low quality of their industry and so anything too complicated was doom to fail anyway.

Insight is 20/20, remember that those tanks were designed before the invasion of the Soviets. From the German perspective the war so far have been just a series of quick victories where maintenance had very little impact on the outcome.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhVDZJOWFDcHh6UjZnMEVlYVl3VnduWWdjSlhOemhyTGNYM3FiQ0J5TVJNQkl6NkU0WnpJVGt3b3d6TTJOZmNLZHoxeG8yYXB6TmdfVldZUlctcmhLY2k5VDBOV3FWYzNiWllIUm9MRnZqa0E9
"But if you’re fighting insurgents with, at most, technicals and some occupied brick buildings, you don’t really need more than a 50 cal. And saving weight saves money, fuel etc, and gives more mobility which is also important if there’s a lot of off road operations in a large country.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhamg1V2duWGVMYnBpcGZtejduZ1RydTlBV3h4a0F4WlhtUms0SFhRX3lMTWNlVHRsbG1KRWNzMy1BWWdWQnlpa2tsdksxVEprNHhQVFE4cDZGdjE5SlE9PQ==

"The common answer is weight distribution, but an equally important and less commonly given reason is speed. A great comparative study is the Pz 2 Lynx/Luchs, which is a fast light tank weighing 12 tons and also has interleaved road wheels. Another comparative study is the Churchill tank, which has small non-interleaved road wheels and is a very slow tank.

Tank tracks don't evenly support a tank, the road wheels support the tank. Even though the track is continuous, if you have five road wheels then there are five points where most of the load of the tank is transferred to the ground. If you had 10 smaller road wheels in the same space, then you'd have 10 points where the load is transferred to the ground. The result is that the design with more road wheels has a much lower peak ground pressure than the design with fewer road wheels. 

Lower ground pressure has a number of effects, most importantly improving tactical mobility.

So as you shrink road wheels, you get better weight distribution. But as you shrink road wheels, you also have more of them and they quickly start to get small. Smaller road wheels are bad for obstacle crossing- if you've ever ridden a bicycle with small versus large wheels, the larger wheels ride smoother and also makes traversing bumps and curbs much easier. This is especially important the faster you want to go. 

See as a comparison the Churchill tank, it uses many small road wheels, which were not a problem due to its low speed.

Interleaving large road wheels is trying to get the best of both worlds. By having more road wheels that are offset each other, you get a low ground pressure and a more continuous contact with the ground. By having large road wheels, you retain the obstacle crossing capability of larger wheels. The big drawback, is that now maintenance and production becomes much more difficult. 

See the Pz 2 Lynx as an example of a light tank with interleaved road wheels for the same reasons. It could drive up to 60 km/hr and was a capable off road vehicle.

At the time those German tanks were designed, speed and maneuverability was considered essential, so the trade-off in complexity was thought to be worth it. 

It's also the case that when those tanks were designed the German army was well supplied, and the heavy tank doctrine called for those tanks to be breakthrough tanks, for which a higher maintenance design was acceptable. As the war ground on those heavy tanks were increasingly asked to perform as mobile medium tanks where their maintenance issues were a much bigger liability. 

Really - the interleaved design wasn't unreasonable. The design has become somewhat notorious for getting bogged down in the Russian winter, where mud would get between the road wheels and freeze there. While that was a flaw, it's a pretty specific flaw to that specific time and place. It's not even the entire winter, once the ground freezes solid it's no longer a problem. In any case, later designs solved it by leaving more space between the interleaved wheels. While the general maintenance issues would have still been present, and non-interleaved seems to be the better design overall, I really doubt we'd be having discussions about interleaved wheels 80 years later if it wasn't for that mud.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhcEpvN3h5VGtmRXV6MV9qbFdlSzlQZEVLLXhYODZURUZaNUN1QVRFaDdzYzdWbjNRcDVPNk96UEVucUVmNllyWGYyNTloWWZfUUxIejFwS1d5VDg5cEE9PQ==
">So I have concluded that there is a double standard in the war so far between non-combatant countries allowing their territory and infrastructure to support expeditionary operations.

So in case you haven't noticed, the entirety of Kremlin posturing in the public space has been a massive double standard. More accurately, it's as if the russian government took a list of all manipulation strategies known to man and wrote a giant **TO-DO LIST** at the very top

>So how is it that it is permissible from any country's perspective that Belarus cannot be attacked while providing infrastructural support to Russian military, but if NATO countries were to do the same, then Russia threatens attacks in those countries?

It's the great miracle of russian propaganda which has managed to achieve this bizzare situation, where russia doing A is okie-dokie, while NATO doing A is escalatory and bad. russia strikes apartment buildings daily, but NATO allies don't allow Ukraine to use their weapons for strikes within russia. NATO arming Ukraine only prolongs the war, but russia receiving arms from North Korea and Iran is fine and dandy.

On a related note, russian threats about striking NATO countries can in most cases be simply disregarded. russia genuinely shits it's pants at the thought of NATO countries actually getting serious in supporting Ukraine, or worse for them, actually getting their own militaries involved in the conflict, which such a strike would most likely assure. Small arms, HIMARS, modern tanks, ATACMS and many more were supposed to be a red line that when crossed would result in a nuclear war, and yet not a single nuke has fallen, and every single time russia went from ""this will cause a nuclear war"" to ""this is actually not a problem for us"".

russia's best shot at winning this war is making sure NATO doesn't get involved any more than it already is, and attacking NATO countries is probably the best way to achieve precisely the opposite effect. All this russian posturing about attacking NATO countries is merely a tool to scare the average person, and through that hopefully pressure NATO politicians from supporting Ukraine, which strangely and depressingly enough, seems to be working.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhR0E2cjU3VjNMeWNSYWhwdHFoY0xhTEFPTF82ZmxkY1MtaG1QYmdZQXFFT0M0aWp6MnIxN096SHZ1VFlQdTJ0Yy1iaHgzeTFnSkl0OXB2MnRUYzh5ZXc9PQ==
"This is a very insightful comment, and I enjoyed reading and thinking about it. You actually extrapolated a point I commonly make to others that I absolutely missed here for my own thinking: whether in person or online, I've seen a few times people say ""Why doesn't x-country fight fair, be a man?"" 

For one example being the Gulf War where, if you're this aware you're likely aware that the Iraqi military was a shell of what people try to brag it was, from purged generals and pilots, to absolutely unserviceable aircraft, to a completely incompetent chain of command largely because of demoralized conscripts, jailed leadership and technical staff, and a destroyed Iraqi economy, as well as idiotic political control of the military - people will say _""well if Iraq had 70 airplanes, why didn't the US just go it alone and attack with 70 airplanes and be a man, instead of attacking with all these other countries and 700 airplanes?""_ That's an exact quote from somebody I've had this argument with, not my numbers. 

To which I'm like: _""are you seriously asking why they didn't fight fairly? It's war. Fighting fairly in war is not fighting to win. War is literally the absolute worst abomination of anything humanity can do, this isn't a boxing match, this isn't an MMA match, this isn't a basketball game, this is humans turning other humans into pieces of hamburger meat as efficiently as possible, creating countless orphans, widows, destroyed families and businesses, etc. it's WAR. Fighting fairly and not cheating is not fighting to win. By that logic no one should ever introduce new weapons in the middle of a war that bring favor to their own side because it's not fair? Like when Germans cried in World War I that Americans using shotguns in trench combat in close quarters was too deadly/basically cheating, and too effective. The Germans actually said that any American found that surrendered or was injured with a shotgun in their possession or shotgun shells would be immediately executed. Or the Geneva conventions trying to say that if you're a tank crew member, and you shoot somebody with the heavy machine gun on the tank which would blow a human apart, is inhumane, and therefore you must use the coaxial medium machine gun which is typically a 7.62. It's irrational and holds no basis. People think wars still like some somewhat gentlemanly affair like lines of infantry firing muskets in 1800s at somewhat mutually planned battles""_

"That’s a bit of a tricky question. The short answer is no, pastoralists steppe people acquired most of the metal armor and weapons they had through trade (or violence) with settled neighbors.

"I'll get the big elephant out of the room first, the absolute best situation would delaying service enough that the war ends.

So in this case, it was absolutely more useful to avoid the military as much as possible as the war hopefully ends before your number is called up.

We obviously have hindsight on this, but you could tell when things are wrapping up. In Europe, the public could see the push into Germany in early 45. Japan was obviously less certain even into Summer of 45.

That being said, if you were an early volunteer, you'd have more opportunities to hopefully get what you want, especially if you have relevant skills.

Coveted positions do fill up, so someone more qualified than you for an Army Air Force position might have taken your position if you came the week after. But luckily, you came first.

This may translate to a cushy and safer position, which in turn may increase your chances of surviving the war.

So delaying and entering first can both increase surviving until the end of the war.

This was, obviously, not the case as soldiering is not conducive to learning how to farm, but the good news was that new settlements were often full of veterans who could be made into an effective militia very quickly in the event of an emergency.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnY2JVb0dFV3lnMzJheWVXYmtQeGFUd2JGYjFYYW5HbC1vUG0ycDRrVk40eGNxMzdNVDJycXJPTll6X05ibHhRMnpMTmRKeUV3cUtaeDhBS19TVkd6RFE9PQ==

"It starts to get very difficult to do a proper comparison because engineering data is not available. 

Instead, people say that ground pressure is equal to force divided by area, and they use the weight of the vehicle divided by the contact patch of the treads (area of the treads in contact with the ground).  This calculation specifically ignores the factor I discussed above, which is that weight is not evenly distributed across the tread. 

In reality, there are a variety of factors that impact the ground pressure along the length of the tank, there's a difference between dynamic pressure versus static pressure, etc. At the end of the day, any detailed engineering or test data is not provided to the public, and the basic ground pressure is just an engineering rule of thumb where you still test the vehicle to make sure it performs how you want. We still have the basic rule of thumb that more road wheels is equal to less pressure, but how exactly that shakes out depends on those other factors.

The main answer is that most of them just weigh less, mainly because tank doctrine discarded the concept of medium vs. heavy tanks versus a force just made up of an all-around main battle tank. In short tons (2,000 lbs), the Tiger 1 tank was 63 tons and the Tiger 2 tank was 75 tons. The M60 started at around 50 tons, the M1 Abrams started at around 60 tons, the T-72 started at 51 tons, the T-80 started at 47 tons, the T-90 started at 51 tons.

It's only in the last 10-20 years where we've seen tanks significantly above 60 tons and into 70 tons, as designers have retrofit additional technology and protection onto legacy tanks such as the M1 Abrams and Leopard 2. The M1A2 SEP v3 tips the scales at 74 tons, the Leopard 2A7V comes in at 73 tons. These tanks can exceed 80 tons with optional equipment.

To be clear, the modern tanks have a lot more surplus capability to operate within. The Tiger 1 and Tiger 2 could already be slow and fragile under the right conditions, so you add 15 tons onto the design weight and it collapses under its own weight or becomes totally immobile. Modern tanks have modern powerplants, transmissions, and suspensions, all of which are much better and much higher quality than the WW2 equivalent. Consider a 1945 model year Ford Truck compared to a 2000 model year Ford Truck. 

But, those systems seem to be reaching or are above their practical limit. I'm sure they're seeing increased maintenance and breakdowns as a result. It's already reported that these vehicles are facing mobility, transportation, and recovery challenges due to their weight. These aren't major challenges in a COIN environment in the desert, but they are much more problematic in mechanized warfare.

It's also important to be realistic about what is achievable. The initial Russian invasion into Ukraine was entirely Russian equipment designed with Russian mud in mind. Plenty of their lighter tanks and other AFVs got stuck in the mud, some to the point of abandonment. So of course an 80 ton Abrams is at higher risk of getting stuck in the mud, but the 50 ton Soviet tank can get itself plenty stuck as well.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnYURnOS1CNUxlUEV1Wm5ISVdhVEtRWmpsU2hDbFJaeUxuRkJRMlE4VnhUXy1MR0dKV0tWeDdHUmVYTURmTi12RHMyQ1BQWVNIYjJoRUIyWUdNUW1QdkE9PQ==

"The history is not brief.

To sum up:

During the Hundred Years’ War the English destroyed French medieval forces.

Starting with Joan of Arc, aggressive French generals developed a new army system using guns that drove the English out of France and became the basis for all modern armies.

Different countries copied the modern army system, and made practical improvements, all improvements being tested and proven in blood.

The increasingly powerful armies drove improvements in government, finance etc

">The proliferation of gunpowder weapons was a huge leg up for agricultural societies in that regard, because it allowed for rapid training of soldiers who otherwise might not have innate martial training. As has often been noted, an English longbowmen (not to mention a knight or man at arms) takes a lifetime to train, 

Just going to take this aside, for a bit, because it's often repeated and seems common sense at first glance, but it isn't really *true*

There's a few angles here. 

>The proliferation of gunpowder weapons was a huge leg up for agricultural societies in that regard, because it allowed for rapid training of soldiers who otherwise might not have innate martial training

This implies 1, people didn't have martial training and 2 that gunpowder allowed for a new technology that empowered them. 

Neither of those claims are demonstrably true. In regard to the first point, martial culture has been a thing - especially in Europe - for most of it's history. 
It is arguably truer in the middle east (some parts...) and Asia. But you run into a pretty weird space pretty quickly. 

The central issue here I'd argue is that while, yes the Mongol were militant and herding steppe cultures were in general and more so, it was not that other cultures lacked this, but they had more. 

As to the second point, it's something said of crossbows as well, so it's not totally new technology. Is a musket easier to use than a crossbow? 
I'd probably argue no, it isn't. They're certainly more dangerous. 

As a few historians have also pointed out, it actually takes substantially more training to make a competent Pike and Shot force than a company of archers. This is when things like drill and organisation also become really important issues. 

As far as... 

>whereas you can train a man to fire a musket in a few hours, and to be a soldier in a few weeks. 

You can't even train a man to fire a modern rifle in ""a few hours"" let alone a musket which has several factors going against it. 
1. Slow loading
2. Difficult maintenance. 
3..complicated drill 
4. Potential for errors. 

And again, you cannot train someone to be a soldier in a few weeks. No one can and no one ever has. 
Basic training for most armies is still months. Training to be an actual military man in the modern world is something like six to twelve months. 

And you're talking about operating weapons that require coordination of fire-power between dozens of people to be effective. 

The reason this stuff works, is because it is better.

"The situation was different then! We had a different threat. They thought we would most likely be fighting in places that are not near-peers (because there were no near-peers to the US at that time). 

That meant having a ship that could deploy lots of cheap, but accurate ammunition in littoral zones (which has the advantage of being the place where most of the world lives). Airpower is also crazy expensive compared to what these guns could offer. Imagine being able to control a littoral area with this ship, freeing up air resources for further inland. A ship can have 100% time on station if it wants - which I assume would be helpful in some situations, and before today's missiles existed.

They knew about the distance issue of the guns and also that some countries did have missiles that would threaten the ship, that's why they made it a stealth ship. Also, they wouldn't put it in harms way - it would have been used via some combined arms package that could make up for its weaknesses.

"A couple of corrections : 

What happened at the end of the Hundred Years war was the creation of a permanent army. This army was divided in compagnies amounting to around 600 men : 100 knights, 300 archers, 100 pikemen and 100 pages (non-combatants). No firearms there, it came a couple of centuries later, but the French did have a solid artillery. 

The Carolean reforms in Sweden, under the leadership of Gustavo Adolphus may be the real starting point for gun based military organisation with a structure that we can understand today. After that you get iterations, with the Prussians, French, Austrians, British etc tweaking the system along their needs and advances in technology.

"as to why the marine corps and army division structures are different you have to understand history. prior to the 1950s both the army and marine corps was organized as squads>platoons>companies>battalions>regiments>division. they were organized as triangular units, meaning that each regiment had 3 battalions with 3 companies each which controlled 3 rifle platoons and a weapons platoon. however in the 1950s there was an experiment conducted known as the pentomic army.

in the beginning of the nuclear age it was thought that nuclear weapons would dominate the future of warfare. that any future war would start and end with a nuclear weapons exchange and land forces such as the army and marine corps would be relegated to occupying nuclear wastes while the navy would have no job as they 1. didn't have nuclear delivery platforms at the time 2. would not be needed because a nuclear exchange would not necessitate the need to have a navy. this would cause the revolt of the admirals but thats a story for another time.

when Eisenhower entered office he was looking to reduce expenditure while maintaining the ability to defend itself using nuclear weapons. as such navy and army funding would drop while air force funding would sky rocket to the point that in 1957 the air force had a budget larger than the army and navy combined.

with this backdrop the army would develop a army structure that could survive in a nuclear battlefield. this would become the pentomic army in this the battalion was removed as an echelon and the battlegroup would takeover the role of the regiment, though the battlegroup would maintain the history and traditions of its parent regiment. the division would have 5 of these battlegroups. a battle group would have 4 companies in the infantry battle group case and 5 companies in the airborne battle group case. with each company being reinforced now consisting of 4 rifle platoons and a weapons platoon. the battlegroup would also receive habitual attachments in the form of a 6 gun battery of 105mm howitzer and a 17 tank armor company. the artillery battery would later be enlarged to an artillery battalion in the 1960.

the way it was imagine to be employed was that the battlegroups would act primarily as resistance islands in the defense, where the area which the battle groups defend were spotty in nature rather than the contiguous lines seen in WW1, WW2 and Korea. in the defense a battlegroup was expected to defend a circumference of ~8800m with the individual platoon expected to defend a frontage of 700m. so they were incredibly dispersed while in the offense the battlegroups had to be concentrated, which would not be a big issue had the division been given enough transport to do so. they were not as the divisional trains would only have 2 APC companies and 1 truck company. with each APC company meant to be able to carry 1 battle group at a time. in both the defense and offense it was expected that the tactical nuclear weapons of the division would destroy or break up the enemy enabling the division to conduct its operations

this structure however was incredibly flawed in that they relied on tactical nuclear weapons for survival, maneuver through a nuclear environment was untested and relied on technology that was not in service. Another one of the major issues that became apparent was the span of control for commanders was too large. in the old structure the regimental commander had to only control 3 maneuver elements and supporting assets. while the battlegroup commander had to control 5 separate maneuver elements followed by supporting assets. this was too much of a strain on the commander

Thus in 1961 the army reevaluated the army structure and developed the ROAD army. the major difference in the road division compared to the pentomic division is the introduction of the brigade headquarters and the reintroduction of the battalion. in the ROAD division each division would have 10 (in infantry and mechanized divisions) or 11 (armored division only) battalions which can then be task organized under one of three brigade headquarters, in practice they were habitual organization which would remain more or less fixed in organization. this would remain as roughly the main organization for army divisions until the 2003 reorganization plan for the US army making brigade combat teams permanent organizations made up of organic battalions. throughout this units had regimental designations for history purposes only.

the US marine corps didn't go through any of this and thus kept their structure of divisions, regiments, battalion.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnUlVwRHhNektBRVI3TEE4b0JOUXRDQUtOOFd4MTJwNUcxbzFHV2lubDQ1NTRaTFpwVEV1NlJva2oyUUk0bWk5bTlvTFBmM3VwcTJQSGZyWWt4NEM0WXc9PQ==

My understanding is that that the Spanish tercios improved on the French permanent army Hundred Years’ War army , that in fighting them the Dutch made further improvements to military drill, and that the Swedes made further improvements as you noted.

"Except you ignore military enlistenment as a whole was already low throughout Europe which isn't bad by itself but when you look at all the commitments the big dogs like France has all over the world, its definitely not an optimistic thing. Esp when they been cutting fundings on overall miltiary defense before the war and a lot of industries of many countries are geared more towards civilian stuff (like  France's focus on luxury goods).

I can attest visiting Germany and France lately people were not only not happy about the war but most would often turn off the TV or walk away from public announcements to focus on rap, celebrity interviews, or whatever their itnereests.

Granted I visisted both countries during Christmas so people just want to chill and relax. But even afterwards the low opinion of the military I witnessed int he  multiple times I visited Paris since shows its not a good sign.

"Legion, Cohorts and Centuries were standardize unit during the Roman Empire. After the collapse of the Empire, things were not really standardize. Resources were too decentralized to create a permanent army. The soldiers that fought had to move around to where war were happening, or join a temporary army in time of war, or were working for a noble doing other military task during peace time (training, guard, security, taxes, etc).

Company. Actually this unit have a very social origin. A lot of research show that human are able to maintain relationship with 100 to 250 people and in most of history the main social military unit have been around this size. The 100 men centuria, the 120 men maniple, or the more company all played a similar role. Even the word company  come from companionship. Now I don't know exactly when the word company started to be use, but even in medieval Europe when military unit were not standardize, you still have small group of men 100-250, who were under the command of a captain, which was more of a title at the time. It just meant the leader of the group. The Spanish Tercio had 10 companies each lead by a captain and the first Tercio was in 1534.

Platoon come from the French Peleton, which seem to have come from 1547. This started as a firing unit, each companies would be divided into lines that would firing together as a volley. The platoon might have became an official unit under the Swedish in 1618, but this isn't clear.

Battalion came from the Dutch who were fighting the Spanish Tercio during the Eighty Years War (1568-1648). The Tercio was the best military at the time and the Spanish the richest empire, while the Dutch were a relatively small nation. They had to use a lot of innovation and one of the them was the Battalion. You can see more info on that [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9db5d2dRDHg), but basically the Dutch took inspiration from the Roman, who used the more maneuverable maniple to win against the more powerful, but slower phalanx. A Tercio was 2500-300 men, while a Dutch Battalion was 500-900 men. It was a lot easier to command tactically (this is why even today the Battalion is the main tactical unit), and they were deployed in checkered formation so that they could retreat, reinforce or flank as needed.

Regiment just like companies are an older concept even when it wasn't a standard military unit. A few thousand people were just easier for administration (which is why even today Regiment are usually an administration unit only). The word regiment came from the French (even if the concept is older) and the older regiment still in service is the French 1st Regiment from 1479. The point of the regiment was usually to recruit, train and equip units for war, on the battlefield those were usually company, then later the battalion. The Tercio was a regiment type unit, but they used it as a tactical unit on the battlefield.

Brigade was a temporary unit because at this point the size of armies were just too large. I'm not sure if the Italian or French used it first, but it really started to get tracking after Gustavus Adolphus started to use it to great effect on the battlefield. Btw, Gustavus Adolphus in the 17th century took all of the above and really standardized it and improved it into what we know today.

Division. The next big step in military organization come the French, first in theory by the Marshal of France, later in practice during the Seven Years' War (1756-1763). Before this point, each unit had a type (infantry, cavalry, artillery, etc). The Division combined multiple type of military unit into one command. This made commanding much easier since each Division Commander had the tools to complete his mission or take care of his portion of the front without having to rely on other unit to support him.

Corps. This one came from Napoleon in 1805, at this point the mass conscription made the size of the army unmanageable. The idea behind the Corps was to create several mini self sufficient armies that would be commanded by a trusted general. Corps could spread out during marches, which would speed unit the unit (not everybody need to walk on the same road, more area to live off the land, etc), but could concentrate for battle. Breaking the lines of communication was not a big deal since a Corps had everything it need and a trusted general to lead them. This make the overall command of an army much easier.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnS214WGpuVEtSdklKR2NhTVJzZ2VZX0trYWJPczRBLWhjXy1iSFlvWGh4dk9nbFRIWHV5a0JqV2k4Q1UtXzdZb2ZRY3d6NldHRjRBRmtMSUstamRxV0pFd2U0Vl9aS2ludWFLM2ZOMWtwSmc9
Depend what you mean by overlapping. In a normal tank you already have two wheels side by size as you can see [here](https://previews.123rf.com/images/outsiderzone/outsiderzone1702/outsiderzone170200152/71596887-defense-military-tank-detail-of-tracks-or-wheels-of-the-off-road-armored-vehicle.jpg). The point of interweaving road wheels is to take advantage of the small space in-between the normal road wheel like [here](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/dd/f7/c6/ddf7c6bef5a2bc929848d3fd9c0e0a8a.jpg).,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnR0l3Yjk2RXZIb015SGUzSFllYnJ0VWpZNjRuZHlhSHV3RWZ6UzIxajdLQWttQnhYaFVIV1h2R3hCcHBqSkxiSW1WcHR2bmo0UXFBQXpzNHFEUm5iLXNOZDNqTFFfTnhURktuZUhTLUZhVzg9
"To add to your ""timing is everything"" theme and to add some data as u/TheOneTrueDemoknight's point below on why data is necessary:

If you were in the Army Air Forces in Europe, early in the war, it was an achievement to get to 25 missions as a bomber crew - at which point you'd get to go home. Later in the war, especially with air superiority achieved, the number of missions required to get sent home increased - a sign that survival rates for Army aircrew got better as the war progressed.

Meanwhile, you'd think the Navy had it better in 1945 than early in the war, right? But the Navy's own records would say otherwise:

https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/u/us-navy-personnel-in-world-war-ii-service-and-casualty-statistics.html

Granted, this is very crude stuff (you'd have to look at individual records to get the truth data): but in 1942, with ~1.2 million in the Navy (337,000 strength on 7 December 1941, add ~873k enlisting in 1942), there 2,809 killed in action in 1942 - or if you go off the peak strength (which would likely be the # at the end of 1942), that was 0.233% killed.

In 1945, peak strength is listed as 31 Jul 1945, with 3,405,525 in the Navy. In 1945, however, 11,446 were killed. So if you compare that to the peak, that was 0.336% killed - a 44% higher rate (albeit still small, overall) than in 1942!

So it really comes down to what phase of the conflict you entered and what job you had. A bomber guy in Europe in 1942 would absolutely have it worse than the guy showing up in 1945. However, a Navy guy on a destroyer in 1942 in Pacific isn't dealing with kamikazes like in 1945 off Okinawa or in action in preparation for the final push on Japan.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnampZMDcwVWZoalpCUUh4V3p4azljRTJTbnRhUHNiQ3E5Um9RNEFaSGZvMVNZNjN6N1h2VUVmYjhnSXVTMWg4dFp0YXhTX1FkQ2tuQ3hKb3hPOTZBSmc9PQ==

"The US Army on several occasions accomplished strategic level encirclements.  Some examples:

Falaise: Following the breakout from Normandy, the Allies met in Falaise having encircled Army Group B.  German human losses were around 60,000 (10,000 KIA remainder prisoners) and effectively all heavy equipment of German forces committed to the battle in France.  

Mons: US 1st Army encircled and destroyed several German formations, in exchange for 89 US KIA, 25,000+ Germans were captured

Ruhr: US forces encircle and capture 312,000 Germans.

  
Your impression is one of those classic...""I listen to what HOI players on the internet say"" positions.  I don't mean this in a disparaging way exactly, but there's a tendency to hold up German operations as strategic genius while being only dimly aware of Allied ones because that's just kind of the perverse ""rule of cool"" that comes with WW2 gaming.  

This isn't to fall into a hagiography of course, but there's a tendency to reduce the US Army to an artillery dispenser without really understanding either the accomplishments of the Army, how it fought, or the problems it faced. To an example, when it was in terrain that inhibited maneuver (Hedgerows of Normandy, limited roads and rough country of the Ardennes) more attritional warfare was practiced.  While this is often described as some sort of American weakness...I mean look at the German attacks in the same sectors, the same force on force artillery centric battles because that's what the terrain supported.

When the countryside was open, such as post-Cobra in France, or post-Rhine crossing, the US Army completed significant maneuvers as detailed above in addition to quite a few smaller tactical encirclements as that's more or less what the US Armored force was designed to do.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnUUdGNnFWOEs0bDJNY3lobUE5T3NnM0hfU21lNkdBU1FTazFRelE0NDZtXzJLaWtNV2lCY2RQdGw1WWdyUUEtbDJpb1dsOGRVb1gtMzNLQXpyUjVNOXpBOTRhSGxBSmk4X3FidlFPREVQUE09

"Most famously the Americans achieved an encirclement in the Ruhr in April 1945. The “Ruhr Pocket” led to approximately 317,000 Germans being taken prisoner, including 24 generals, and about 10,000 killed, including civilians, and Field Marshal Walter Model killed himself. The Americans had 1,500 killed, 500 missing, and 8,000 wounded. The Americans also liberated hundreds of thousands of slave laborers, mostly Soviet POWs. 

Model, knowing his forces were composed largely of old men and boys, most of whom were armed only with pistols, realized he would be quickly encircled by the fast-moving mechanized American troops and asked Hitler for permission to withdraw before the two pincers closed around him. Hitler refused, saying Model should hold out and tie down the Americans for as many months as possible. Model estimated he had enough food for three weeks. 

The Americans completely surrounded the pocket on April 1, trapping the approximately 370,000 German soldiers and militia inside, along with millions of civilians. Then the Americans methodically tightened the encirclement. Some German units fought to the death, others quickly surrendered. On April 10, the city of Essen was captured and the pocket was split into two. The smaller pocket surrendered the following day. 

Model’s chief of staff begged him to order all units to surrender in order to save as many German lives as possible, military as well as civilian. Model, citing Hitler’s orders, refused, but he did discharge the boys or old men from the militia. By April 16, most German troops were running out of ammo; the following day, Model told his men to either attempt to break out as organized units, which he knew to be impossible, or if not, drop their weapons and escape as individuals. It was essentially an order to surrender. Model himself later tried to escape, but on April 21 shot himself rather than be captured.",r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnNjZzZUNQRmc5NHdUN3k0UFlMV2I1aThJZUpHV1Y1VXQwYUYtSVVFR2lDdTZqQVp5bmtidkR4My1wNk1HdVBSRktWNEtZTURFdWx2R01ocXlxQXBCMWc9PQ==
