"Over 5 years we are very likely still seeing the effects of individual months and shorter term influences like El Ni√±o. For example, if you look at individual Novembers and Marches, did any stick out as warmer or dryer than usual? This reduced storminess would also manifest as reduced windiness. Related to this, La Ni√±a conditions (which we‚Äôve had for 3 of the previous 5 years) can, on average, bring reduced storminess and rainfall to the South Island. For example, [the NIWA summary for November 2020](https://niwa.co.nz/sites/default/files/Climate_Summary_November_2020_Final.pdf) mentions a warm, dry month for the South Island due to La Ni√±a.

Around 30 seconds later, the other side of the river lit up with a bright orange glow, which we originally thought was someone with a lantern or torch. 

However, we quickly realised this light was coming from an orange glowing sphere, almost like a basketball sized sun. It was crossing the river towards us whilst moving side to side.

"The snowy winter sound more believable to me. It doesn't take much to go from having 3-5 snow days a winter to 0-2 snowy days each winter. And 3 snow days are enough to remember a snowy winter from my experience.

People don't remember a less than average snow year but they notice if there isn't a single snow day all winter and at least in Germany that has now happened a few times. People are almost begging, in the way they speak about winter, for it to snow, just so everything feels normal again.

Similarly people notice that instead of 1 or 2 days above 30¬∞C we now have weeks with such temperatures and 1-5 days above 35¬∞C. So even if it's just 1 or 2 degrees above average people are right when they say we never had such extreme summers for example. That's at least true here in Germany. There also is a huge difference in how days feel if it's just a bit hotter near body temperature. The drop of in energy to work or concentrate between 30 and 35 is much harsher than between 25 and 30 degrees. People notice this.

Interestingly this summer is truly an exception in Germany. Since record keeping began in the 19th century we never had such a rainy summer or 12 months for that matter.

 The feeling that this weather and climate isn't right, is I believe justified and not just a wishful interpretation of climate change. Even if our memory is misleading as to the exact reasons our experience of climate has already changed. Of course ageing etc. also plays a factor in how different we experience the climate.

I always try to give such factual information, what actually changed, if people communicate such feelings of change. It really gives climate change a personal relation because you have experience matching what the theories say and that helps people understand on a level raw data will just never be able to. And given that there still is a huge gap between scientific understanding and personal and public decision making every bit of awareness and understanding matters or humanity is doomed.",r/weather,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaN2xoZzVobVlTV2Y3TlZFUUhlcDZuUE1nR3VBUzRhMFBPTzlqZmZYTUhUSUEtQ3AtYzV6TTZLZ2NpOHhjdWxNdEplM3RydmJELW9sRXc5S0l3Rk9XaEE9PQ==

By looking at this photo these look like short patches of primary and secondary rainbows to me. And the fact that the colors were reversed just confirms the rainbow theory as well. The secondary bow has the same colors as the primary but just in a reversed order.¬†¬†


The radius of the primary bow is 42¬∞ and 51¬∞ for the secondary. That makes them around 100¬∞ degrees apart at the max. It's really hard to estimate the correct distance without any tools, but I'd say your 120¬∞ degree estimate got pretty close.

"Hey üëã 

I‚Äôve made several posts like this in other places. I too have a fear of weather but I have had no traumatic experiences to trigger it.. no idea where it‚Äôs came from‚Ä¶ people tell me to look into Therapy, someone I knows tried it & said it works.. I‚Äôm currently in the process of starting that.. 

The guy I speak to told me to write things down in a notebook. Write things you care about, a list, write to yourself or a friend or family member or just write around the storms. Write your fears. Write write write. When you‚Äôre done burn it. Throw it away, or leave positive notes for you to see in the future. Sometimes it helps to just put your thoughts somewhere‚Ä¶ Your fear comes from being older & having more things you worry/care about. Things that mean something if you were to lose them. 

Anyways, I am currently anxious because we‚Äôre getting a storm tonight. First sign of rain I‚Äôm on one of my 3-4 weather apps watching radar trying to do math and science to see how bad it‚Äôll be , how long it‚Äôll last & etc.. 

It‚Äôs all bad. IF you ever needed a ‚ÄúThunder-Buddy‚Äù I wanted to suggest to you that my inbox is always welcome to anyone. We can both cry together about our fear but we can both also work it out together. Stay strong.

       Mesoscale Discussion 1641
       NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
       0655 PM CDT Mon Jul 15 2024

       SUMMARY...A corridor of higher wind potential appears to be emerging
       across east-central Iowa into northwestern Illinois. High-res
       experimental guidance suggests wind gusts upwards of 80-90 mph and
       embedded circulations will be possible over the next 1-2 hours.
    
       DISCUSSION...Reflectivity and velocity data from KDVN shows a broad
       circulation developing across the IA/WI/IL tri-state region, which
       is believed a deepening MCV that is typically associated with a
       mature MCS. To the southwest, a bowing segment is becoming
       established across eastern IA. A diffuse baroclinic zone (denoted by
       temperature/dewpoints in the 90s and upper 70s respectively lies
       immediately downstream to the southeast of this emerging bow. This
       should provide a focus for propagation over the next few hours.
       Latest WoFS guidance and HRRR solutions have picked up on this trend
       and suggest significant severe wind gusts (including gusts upwards
       of 80-90 mph) are probable. Additionally, adequately strong (around
       30 knots) low-level shear is in place and should support embedded
       circulations - especially within any portions of the line that can
       become more north-south oriented",r/weather,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnSXdKZXJuSjBubjZYRDg5WGhvaVBjVkhZd3BEdllCWW9lTkxWZm9MS2lHNFFYU0lyUWQyRk54OGZ1aUg4UUM4ZWcyWlUzd21EcGlRT3V0RVpSVXNTWTdJc0NIdV92Tk9PR0VrZUo3SUZDUm89

"A WW is issued when there is a 50% or greater probability of a warning happening for the risk.

So a Flood Watch means 50% or greater chance of flood warning.

So you might have a 45% chance of a tornado or however the algorithm does it, but it's still not enough for it to cross the line even though it does cross the threshold for a severe thunderstorm.

The goal is to avoid over warning and making people numb, which does result in deaths.

"    Mesoscale Discussion 1642
       NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
       0826 PM CDT Mon Jul 15 2024

       SUMMARY...The potential for significant wind gusts upwards of 80-95
       mph and embedded QLCS tornadoes will continue as a severe MCS pushes
       east across northern Illinois.
    
       DISCUSSION...The evolution of a severe MCS is progressing as
       expected with two primary bowing segments evident in regional radar
       across north-central IL and to the east of the Davenport, IA area.
       Several embedded circulations have been noted as well as multiple
       reports of wind gusts over 75 mph (including one gust of 93 mph in
       Stephenson county, IL) across eastern IA and northwest IL. Latest
       WoFS guidance continues to capture recent convective trends well and
       depicts the potential for similar wind speeds within the two bowing
       segments over the next couple of hours. Given aforementioned reports
       and favorable environmental conditions downstream, these forecasts
       appear to be reasonable. Observed storm motion tracks and WoFS
       timing guidance both suggest the MCS will be approaching the lower
       Lake Michigan shore between 02 to 03 UTC with a slightly later
       arrival time for eastern IL/far western IN.

">*A tornado warning means one has been sighted.*

Most tornado warnings go out when Doppler radar indicates there is rotation in a storm. Rotation doesn't mean there is a funnel cloud or a tornado. It may stay up in the cloud and not come down but they don't take chances. The National Weather Service does depend on trained storm spotters to visually confirm what radar indicates. But if they waited for that before sending out a tornado warning it would be too late.",r/weather,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnWWhJQkFoNjJvcmpBTXFaZ19CMjBjSm5xYzFJS0VnY2pVZnE5cDAyRV9kZmxpbXZFOWFzT3pJTTB1aHVuZ2R5SXR6Mk5vR2JTc3dMdEJVOXI3RGtvR2c9PQ==

I know a lot of people from the more rural parts down past Joliet that absolutely do not consider themselves part of Chicagoland, but seeing ""almost everywhere"" would get their attention.
