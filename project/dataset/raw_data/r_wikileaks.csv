Anonymous Bitcoin Donor Foots Bill For Julian Assange’s Flight Into Freedom

"It was, at least initially, funded by smaller donations. Meanwhile, the various blocked funding and so on really doesn't amount to ""net worth"", and has never really been available to either Assange or Wikileaks, thanks to the expected US state department scummery. 

And remember that a lot of papers, and individual journalists - even many who publically dismiss Assange as inconsequential - have earned absurd amounts of money from reporting based on the wikileaks foundation, and also from the wikileaks model (as in: digital, anonymous deaddrops). So when it comes to private donations to take care of at least some of the problems, I don't think there's been any lack of those even just from private actors in the media-business itself - even with the worst tabloids who couldn't care less about press-freedom: Assange was a popular and controversial subject to report on, and so was the content.

Assange and anyone like him will always be a liability to people in power. But keep in mind that even the slavishly deferential media outlets that generally follow the prescribed narratives - see the value of Wikileaks controversies. 

I remember one donation I saw when working for a PAC in the US - it was a spite-donation. They wanted someone on the opposite side to specifically grill their own candidate. That was done, and no one checked the lists or asked questions. So I assume that was not uncommon. It's kind of a game. But I don't think there has been any lack of donations for Assange. Papers and publishers are no doubt looking for (as they were when he was first arrested) ways to fund book-deals and things like that. 

As in, even before any actual sympathy and interest in the important press-freedom aspects of this case is involved, long before legal bills and promotion of the case - remove that entire aspect, and Assange would likely still have managed to receive donations enough to keep the lights on, and more.",r/wikileaks,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNERUtmbU1NdDg2MGhzTm9qS0FsUjh0MGlyOHRGcmJGbWczcmFLY1d5RmJLeDFjbHJaR1lSc3ZGQTBRODFJNHBmLXNCV3d1d2s2WjE2ZGYxRmdZUGVtVEE9PQ==

">the British lawyers representing the U.S. government concluded they would run into “an ethical obligation to drop the case” because of “their duty of candor” — they could no longer argue for extradition when a condition required by the court had not been met.

Pffh hahaha.

So what you're reading here is a justice department moron inventing something mostly out of whole cloth to create the image of that the ""plea deal"" was actually a clever move. Perhaps that phrase has been used, once, in a movie or something. But that - willing to bet many Sterling Silver Talents on that - just completely made up. 

The WP will print anything their insiders tell them to, without any investigation or second sources, whatsoever. The only secondary source suggested here is the Wikileaks editor, who suggests the right to appeal from May was a turning point -- no. No chance. What has changed is the realization that prosecuting Assange for what the punditry and the political figures have already judged him for in a court would be a spectacle they wouldn't be able to handle in terms of PR.

So the actual report they should have written is that the US waited out the clock on something that couldn't possibly have worked out without heavy problems, perhaps hoping the conditions would be right to get some opportunity to get away with it in court (probably by someone utterly ignorant of the law). Meanwhile, the CIA has tried to off the guy how many times? This has been waited out, knowing full well that that was the best outcome they could hope for: Ruin Assange's life by using political pressure on an ally and keep him entrenched in a legal battle, while threatening - believably - to just send him to Gitmo whether he's guilty or not, or whether the ruling would be controversial or whatever. 

And now that it's over, they're blaming procedural prudence from the courts that produced barristers who basically wrote down the arguments the US State Department clones required, and produced it in court - mostly under secrecy, to the point of trying to prosecute journalists who reported on what they said.

You just described Fox News when a Democrat is president or CNN/MSNBC when a Republican is president.
