In economic terms, it is China.

This isn't me saying it but the IMF, among several other embedded sources. Even if we go by the presumption China is the 2nd economic power out of 180+ countries instead of #1.... China has a more robust industrial, manufacturing base than the US. See for yourself the state of Detroit, Ohio, the rust belt of America vs China.

The US is more a mercantile economy benefitting from the dollar's world Reserve status.

""Produce One Chapter Like It The Miraculous Inimitability of the Qur’ān’s Shortest Chapter""


The Qur'ān presents a challenge to humanity to produce one chapter like it. Its shortest chapter, Al-Kawthar, displays a remarkable frequency of linguistic devices and literary features, and it expresses maximal meaning within a unique structure. Informed by both Islamic and Western scholarship, this essay aims to showcase the Qur’ān’s miraculous literary and linguistic inimitability by analysing its smallest chapter. It also addresses key objections.


Here is a challenge. Take ten words in any language, formulated into three lines or verses, and add any preposition or linguistic particle you see fit. Produce at least twenty-seven rhetorical devices and literary features. At the same time, ensure it has a unique structure, is timelessly meaningful, and relates to themes within a book that it is part of — the size of the which is over seventy-thousand words. Make sure four of its words are unique and never used again in the book. Ensure each line or verse ends with a rhyme, created by words with the most optimal meanings. Make sure that these words are used only once in the three lines, and not used anywhere else in the book. Ensure that the three lines concisely and eloquently semantically mirror the chapter before it, and they must formulate a profound response to an unplanned set of circumstances. You must use ten letters in each line and ten letters only once in the entire three lines. Throughout the whole piece, make sure you produce a semantically oriented rhythm, without sacrificing any meaning. Do all of the above publicly in one attempt, without revision or amendment, in absence of any formal training in eloquence and rhetoric.


Impossible as the above may seem, this is exactly what the Qur’ān achieved in its shortest chapter, Al-Kawthar (The Abundance); and it was expressed through Prophet Muhammad ﷺ who was not known to have composed any poetry nor cultivated any special rhetorical skills.
